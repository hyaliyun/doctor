Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured. MATERIAL AND METHODS A preclinical and short-term prospective study was performed. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 5 groups, with 4 rabbits per group, each receiving a different concentration of Artemia salina. In each rabbit, an extract of Artemia salina (2%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%) was randomly instilled in one eye and saline solution (negative control) in the other eye. Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured before and after the instillation of 5 drops per eye (1 drop per hour) on the same day. RESULTS In tear secretion, there was an increase of 43.88  6.73% with 4% Artemia salina in comparison with its baseline measurement (P = 0.049). The rest of the groups did not show differences (P  0.05). For tear break-up time, none of the groups showed differences (P  0.05), while for corneal staining score, there was an improvement of 0.88  0.83 with 4% Artemia salina (P = 0.038) and a deterioration of 0.50  0.83 with control solution (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Short-term instillation of eye drops with 4% Artemia salina produced both stimulation of tear secretion and a slight improvement of physiological corneal staining. Besides, all the doses of up to 10% Artemia salina did not produce undesirable side effects on the ocular surface. Therefore, these eye drops are presented as a possible new treatment for dry eye due to their secretagogue properties and ocular surface regeneration.","output":"Preclinical development of artificial tears based on an extract of Artemia salina containing dinucleotides in rabbits."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently an approved treatment for recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection However, its use in ulcerative colitis is at an early stage and significant gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanisms and logistics of its practical application Methods and results: This article aims to look into specific issues which remain unsettled for use of FMT in ulcerative colitis including donor and recipient selection, route of administration, and duration of therapy We also discuss optimal ways to assess response to FMT and the current state of FMT regulations In addition, we postulate the impact of diet on the microbiome profile of the donor and recipient We also suggest a change in the nomenclature from FMT to fecal microbiome transfer Conclusion: FMT is an evolving therapy There are several considerations for its use in UC but its use and role should be directed by further clinical trials ?

To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the population most at risk of infection. Hence, we aimed to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk comparing it with unspecific surrogates. Methods Retrospective case/control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each subject with Covid-19 confirmed diagnosis (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS), was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. SIS was validated by comparison with specific and unspecific predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results Subjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinsons disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS=4), 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS=1). Conclusion This study identified conditions and diseases making individuals more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cell infection begins when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the human cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we address the role of tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol), chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol), or gentamicin (-4.83 kcal/mol) while inhibiting attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 kcal/(mol nm2 ) for tetracycline-RBD, 5.16 kcal/(mol nm2 ) for doxycycline-RBD, 5.59 kcal/(mol nm2 ) for chloroquine-RBD, and 7.02 kcal/(mol nm2 ) for gentamicin-RBD. Stronger inhibition by tetracycline is verified with nonequilibrium PMF calculations, for which the tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest free energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline binds to tyrosine and glycine residues on the viral contact interface that are known to modulate molecular recognition and bonding affinity. These RBD residues also engage in significant hydrogen bonding with the human receptor ACE2. The ability to preclude cell infection complements the anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of tetracycline; this may reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Tetracycline as an inhibitor to the SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly transforming the healthcare system, with telemedicine, or virtual health, being one of the key drivers of the change.

Methods: Using Baidu Index Platform (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as data resources, we obtained the search volume (SV) of keywords for symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020, in Hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and the epidemic data. Data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. Data of Hubei province were compared with confirmed cases. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and the hysteresis effects were discussed. R3.6.2 software was used to analyze the data. Results: Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001). The SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed or suspected cases (r(confirmed)=0.723, r(suspected)=0.863, all P<0.001). The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who retrieved relevant symptoms on the internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. Conclusions: The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increases significantly.

The sputum fluid phase has several candidate proteins including mucins which have the potential of being therapeutic targets, but has not yet been explored in-depth. This study aimed at exploring the profile of sputum proteins in various airway diseases. METHODS: Sputum from thirty-one patients with various airway diseases was collected and the fluid phase analyzed by LC-MS/MS and subsequently by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragments ion spectra (SWATH) (n = 15) for protein quantitation. Hierarchical clustering and functional grouping were performed. RESULTS: A total of 185 proteins were quantitated by SWATH of which 21 proteins were identified which could distinguish between the clinical phenotypes by hierarchical clustering. Functional protein clustering revealed 4 groups: those that are inflammation related, oxidative stress related, mucin related and a cytoskeletal and calcium related group. The levels of eight proteins (Azurocidin1, Neutrophil defensin 3, Lactotransferrin, Calmodulin 3, Coronin1A, Mucin 5B, Mucin 5AC and BPI fold containing family B1) were significantly altered (relative to mean) in exacerbator prone subjects compared to nonexacerbators. Another simple but useful metric which emerged from this study was total protein concentration in sputum which was significantly higher in frequent exacerbators. CONCLUSION: Sputum proteins can detect the various airway disease clinical phenotypes. Total protein concentration and eight other proteins are biomarkers for frequent exacerbators.

Methods: A voluntary, anonymous survey with 5-point Likert scale and free text was sent to our general surgery interview applicants (Fig. 1). Data including demographics were analyzed using chi-square and paired t-tests. Results: Surveys were completed by 75 of 108 (64.9%) interviewees. Mean (SD) age was 26.9 (2.11) years, 53.3% were male, 77.3% were non-Hispanic White, and 19.9% were an underrepresented minority. Disproportionately fewer female and underrepresented minority applicants completed the survey. Applicants accepted a median of 17 interviews (range 2 to 40). Sixty percent (n = 45) applied to more programs and 52% (n = 39) accepted more interviews because they were virtual;only 25.3% (n = 19) applied to more diverse geographic locations.

We set out to compare the pharmacologic characteristics and dosing requirements of bivalirudin in patients requiring ECMO support for ARDS due to COVID-19 versus ARDS from other etiologies. Design and Setting : This retrospective case control study was performed at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, IN. Participants : Patients were included if they were on veno-venous (VV) ECMO support between June 2019 and June 2020 and divided into two groups: ARDS secondary to COVID-19 and those with ARDS from another etiology (Non-COVID). Interventions : Patient demographics such as age, sex, weight, chronic comorbid conditions, baseline antiplatelet and anticoagulant use, antiplatelet use during ECMO, and need for renal replacement therapy were collected and compared between groups. Time to activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) goal, percentage of time at aPTT goal, bivalirudin rates, total bivalirudin requirements, total duration on bivalirudin, total duration on ECMO, mortality, and complications associated with ECMO were collected and compared between groups. Measurements and Main Results : A total of forty-two patients met inclusion criteria (n = 19 COVID-19, n = 23 Non-COVID). However, percentage of aPTTs at goal were maintained more consistently in patients with COVID-19 versus non-COVID (86% vs. 74%: p < 0.01). Higher median (IQR) daily rates (3.1 mCg/kg/min (2.3-5.2) vs. 2.4 mCg/kg/min (1.7-3.3): p = 0.05) and higher median (IQR) maximum rates of bivalirudin (5 mCg/kg/min (3.7-7.5) vs. 3.8 mCg/kg/min (2.5-5): p = 0.03) were required in the COVID-19 group versus the non-COVID group. Time to goal aPTT was similar between groups. There was no difference in complications associated with anticoagulation as demonstrated by similar rates of bleeding and thrombosis between both groups. Conclusions : Patients on ECMO with ARDS from COVID-19 require more bivalirudin overall and higher rates of bivalirudin to maintain goal aPTTs compared to patients without COVID-19. However, COVID-19 patients more consistently maintain goal aPTT. Future randomized trials are needed to support efficacy and safety of bivalirudin for anticoagulation of COVID-19 patients on ECMO.","output":"Efficacy of bivalirudin for therapeutic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides an overview of extant literature addressing consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies Six focal cutting-edge technologies are identified: artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, wearable technology, robotics and big data analytics Our analysis shows research on consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies is at a nascent stage, and there are several gaps requiring attention To further advance knowledge, our article offers avenues for future interdisciplinary research addressing implications of consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies More specifically, we propose six main areas for future research namely: rethinking consumer behaviour models, identifying behavioural differences among different generations of consumers, understanding how consumers interact with automated services, ethics, privacy and the blackbox, consumer security concerns and consumer interaction with new-age technologies during and after a major global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies: Implications for future research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized develop an acute cardiovascular syndrome. It is urgent to elucidate underlying mechanisms associated with the acute cardiac injury in T2D hearts. We performed bioinformatic analysis on the expression profiles of public datasets to identify the pathogenic and prognostic genes in T2D hearts. Cardiac RNA-sequencing datasets from db/db or BKS mice (GSE161931) were updated to NCBI-Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO), and used for the transcriptomics analyses with public datasets from NCBI-GEO of autopsy heart specimens with COVID-19 (5/6 with T2D, GSE150316), or dead healthy persons (GSE133054). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and overlapping homologous DEGs among the three datasets were identified using DESeq2. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted for event enrichment through clusterProfile. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was established and visualized by Cytoscape. The transcriptions and functions of crucial genes were further validated in db/db hearts. In total, 542 up-regulated and 485 down-regulated DEGs in mice, and 811 up-regulated and 1399 down-regulated DEGs in human were identified, respectively. There were 74 overlapping homologous DEGs among all datasets. Mitochondria inner membrane and serine-type endopeptidase activity were further identified as the top-10 GO events for overlapping DEGs. Cardiac CAPNS1 (calpain small subunit 1) was the unique crucial gene shared by both enriched events. Its transcriptional level significantly increased in T2D mice, but surprisingly decreased in T2D patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PPI network was constructed with 30 interactions in overlapping DEGs, including CAPNS1. The substrates Junctophilin2 (Jp2), Tnni3, and Mybpc3 in cardiac calpain/CAPNS1 pathway showed less transcriptional change, although Capns1 increased in transcription in db/db mice. Instead, cytoplasmic JP2 significantly reduced and its hydrolyzed product JP2NT exhibited nuclear translocation in myocardium. This study suggests CAPNS1 is a crucial gene in T2D hearts. Its transcriptional upregulation leads to calpain/CAPNS1-associated JP2 hydrolysis and JP2NT nuclear translocation. Therefore, attenuated cardiac CAPNS1 transcription in T2D patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights a novel target in adverse prognostics and comprehensive therapy. CAPNS1 can also be explored for the molecular signaling involving the onset, progression and prognostic in T2D patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Identification of Crucial Genes and Key Functions in Type 2 Diabetic Hearts by Bioinformatic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a significant cause of disability in a globally ageing population. Knee replacement surgery has been shown to improve function and quality of life. Access to this intervention can be limited for a number of reasons including rationing of care, lack of healthcare provision in austere environments, and more recently, due to the cessation of elective orthopaedic care as a result of the COVID pandemic. Referral for knee replacement surgery is often guided by the patient's Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Recent therapies including treatment with microfragmented adipose tissue (MFAT) have emerged as alternatives to relieve pain and improve function in such patients. Method. We identified all patients with KOA Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3 and 4 in our dataset of patients treated with a single injection of MFAT and applied published OKS thresholds for referral for TKR to separate them into 3 cohorts according to their functional impairment. 220 patients (95 females, 125 males) with KOA were given one MFAT injection. The function (OKS) and quality of life (EuroQol-5) prior to and 24 months after therapy were compared. Results. MFAT injection provided a statistically significant improvement in the quality of life (EQ-5D) at 24 months in patients with a baseline OKS of 39 or less (p value: &lt;0.001) as well as those with OKS of 27 or less who are deemed suitable for a knee replacement (p value: &lt;0.001). Conclusion. MFAT injection improves quality of life in patients with KOA who are deemed suitable for the knee replacement. MFAT is a low-morbidity alternative biological treatment and can delay the need for total knee replacement in suitable patients.

This article describes the different approaches taken towards optimal fallow periods in Canadian jurisdictions. METHODS: We searched publicly available information from dentist and dental hygiene regulator websites across the 10 provinces and 3 territories in Canada. We also searched for guidance documents on dental associations' websites or through personal communication with government officials. We extracted and tabulated information on fallow period recommendations or guidance, when available. RESULTS: Nine jurisdictions (6 provinces and all 3 territories) acknowledge or provide guidance on fallow periods following aerosol-generating procedures. Among those who have provided guidance regarding a fallow period, recommendations follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance if the air changes per hour (ACH) in the dental operatory is known. CONCLUSION: The evidence for deciding on optimal fallow period is limited and still being explored, resulting in substantial variation across Canadian jurisdictions.

Demographic characteristics and clinical information of these patients were collected on April 27, 2020, when Japanese psychiatrists were virtually allowed to prescribe clozapine beyond the regulatory requirement. Furthermore, information of adverse events related to the emergency measure was collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 41 patients with TRS included in this study, 19 patients underwent extended hematological monitoring during clozapine treatment. No psychiatric or hematological adverse events were observed in the patients during the extended monitoring interval. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that there were few adverse events of clozapine-treated patients related to emergency measures in Japan. However, hematological monitoring intervals during clozapine treatment have been emergently extended worldwide; hence, it is necessary to verify the results of these measures.","output":"No adverse events were observed in clozapine-treated patients on extended hematologic monitoring intervals during the coronavirus pandemic in four psychiatric centers in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tourism sector in general and the hotel sector in particular face the challenge of managing appropriate security measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.

While it primarily affects the respiratory system, we now have evidence that it affects multiple organ systems in the human body. Cardiac manifestations may include myocarditis, life threatening arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, systolic heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. Myocarditis is increasingly recognized as a complication of Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) and may result from direct viral injury or from exaggerated host immune response. The diagnosis is established similar to other etiologies, and is based on detailed history, clinical exam, laboratory findings and non-invasive imaging studies. When available, cardiac MRI is the preferred imaging modality. Endomyocardial biopsy may be performed if the diagnosis remains uncertain. Current management is mainly supportive with the potential addition of interventions recommended for severe COVID-19 disease, such as remdesivir, steroids, and convalescent plasma. In the setting of cardiogenic shock and refractory, life-threatening arrhythmias that persist despite medical therapy, advanced mechanical circulatory support devices should be considered. Ultimately, early recognition and aggressive intervention are key factors in reducing morbidity and mortality.

To overcome these challenges, the Center of Acute Care of the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands, has established a de novo data, image and biobank named Acutelines. PARTICIPANTS: Clinical data, imaging data and biomaterials (ie, blood, urine, faeces, hair) are collected from patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a broad range of acute disease presentations. A deferred consent procedure (by proxy) is in place to allow collecting data and biomaterials prior to obtaining written consent. The digital infrastructure used ensures automated capturing of all bed-side monitoring data (ie, vital parameters, electrophysiological waveforms) and securely importing data from other sources, such as the electronic health records of the hospital, ambulance and general practitioner, municipal registration and pharmacy. Data are collected from all included participants during the first 72 hours of their hospitalisation, while follow-up data are collected at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after their ED visit. FINDINGS TO DATE: Enrolment of the first participant occurred on 1 September 2020. During the first month, 653 participants were screened for eligibility, of which 180 were approached as potential participants. In total, 151 (84%) provided consent for participation of which 89 participants fulfilled criteria for collection of biomaterials. FUTURE PLANS: The main aim of Acutelines is to facilitate research in acute medicine by providing the framework for novel studies and issuing data, images and biomaterials for future research.

To inhibit PKR, many poxviruses encode a pseudosubstrate mimic of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), designated K3 in vaccinia virus. Although the interaction between PKR and eIF2&#945; is highly conserved, some K3 orthologs from host-restricted poxviruses were previously shown to inhibit PKR in a species-specific manner. To better define this host range function, we compared the sensitivity of PKR from 17 mammals to inhibition by K3 orthologs from closely related orthopoxviruses, a genus with a generally broader host range. The K3 orthologs showed species-specific inhibition of PKR and exhibited three distinct inhibition profiles. In some cases, PKR from closely related species showed dramatic differences in their sensitivity to K3 orthologs. Vaccinia virus expressing the camelpox virus K3 ortholog replicated more than three orders of magnitude better in human and sheep cells than a virus expressing vaccinia virus K3, but both viruses replicated comparably well in cow cells. Strikingly, in site-directed mutagenesis experiments between the variola virus and camelpox virus K3 orthologs, we found that different amino acid combinations were necessary to mediate improved or diminished inhibition of PKR derived from different host species. Because there is likely a limited number of possible variations in PKR that affect K3-interactions but still maintain PKR/eIF2&#945; interactions, it is possible that by chance PKR from some potential new hosts may be susceptible to K3-mediated inhibition from a virus it has never previously encountered. We conclude that neither the sensitivity of host proteins to virus inhibition nor the effectiveness of viral immune antagonists can be inferred from their phylogenetic relatedness but must be experimentally determined.","output":"Orthopoxvirus K3 orthologs show virus- and host-specific inhibition of the antiviral protein kinase PKR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus outbreak was first documented in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and it was known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). we encountered four patients whose only symptom was hiccups, and they were found to be COVID-19 positive with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Findings revealed that individuals with few executive function deficits, limited delay discounting and who adopted a generally future-orientation mindset were more likely to be double-vaccinated and to report performing COVID-19 mitigation behaviors with high consistency. The most reliable findings were for delay discounting and future orientation, with executive function deficits predicting mask wearing and hand hygiene behaviors but not distancing and vaccination.

In the Ab-positive cohort, the IFN-gamma level upon both CD4 and CD8 stimulation was 0.04 pg/ml (IQR 0.02C0.13), the CD69 expression on NKT-like cells increased to 10.9% (IQR 6.6C17.3), whereas in the Ab-negative cohort was 0.00 pg/ml (IQR 0.00C0.01 and to 7.5% (IQR 4.0C10.1), respectively (p < 0.001 and p = 0.079). Conclusions: Substantial number of cancer patients experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection during active anti-cancer treatment prior to vaccination, often with asymptomatic course. In SARS-CoV-2-immunized patients, we observed SARS-CoV-2 positive cellular response.

Genetic predisposition among individuals may give rise to variant degree of phenotypic changes but there has yet been a documented unified pathway to explain the idiosyncrasy. In this study, we argue that the susceptibility to epigenetic changes governing molecular cross talks along the BMP and PI3K/Akt pathway may underline how genetic background dictate GC-induced bone loss. Concordantly, osteoblasts from BALB/c or C57BL/6 neonatal mice were treated with dexamethasone for transcriptome profiling. Furthermore, we also confirmed that GC-pre-conditioned mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would give rise to defective osteogenesis by instigating epigenetic changes which affected the accessibility of enhancer marks. In line with these epigenetic changes, we propose that GC modulates a key regulatory network involving the scavenger receptor Cd36 in osteoblasts pre-conditioning pharmacological idiosyncrasy in GIO.","output":"A Core Omnigenic Non-coding Trait Governing Dex-Induced Osteoporotic Effects Identified Without DEXA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breaking a complex bio-social phenomenon (epidemic) into its components, considering the processes that determine its dynamics, formalizing the accepted hypotheses in mathematical equations, selecting appropriate experimental and statistical material, and constructing a mathematical model - those are typical tasks of scientific research.

Recent data revealed a 28.5% increase in drug-related overdose deaths from 2019 to 2020. Adolescents often misuse family members' and friends' prescription opioid medications. Furthermore, adolescents may not possess the knowledge or understanding to safely manage opioid medications. There is a need for a validated scale to effectively measure adolescents' opioid misuse knowledge, attitudes, and interest in learning about prescription opioid safety. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate the Adolescent Opioid Safety and Learning (AOSL) scale with a nationally representative sample of adolescents and confirm the factor structure of the scale using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). METHODS: Adolescent participants (aged 13-18 years) completed the 16-item AOSL scale in Qualtrics from November to December 2020. A total of 774 responses were analyzed. A CFA was performed to determine the fit of the data to the 4-factor model proposed by a prior exploratory factor analysis of the AOSL scale. Fit was assessed using the chi-square test, comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and root mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA). RESULTS: Participants were 50% male and 62% white non-Hispanic. The CFI was 0.984, TLI was 0.980, and RMSEA was 0.048 ([95% CI 0.041-0.054], P-value that RMSEA  0.05 = 0.712). The chi-square test results were 2 = 268.752 on 98 degrees of freedom (P < 0.001). Cronbach's alpha, a measure of internal consistency, was high within each factor. CFA indicated good fit of the current study's data to the 4-factor model. CONCLUSION: We found the AOSL scale measures adolescents' knowledge of opioid misuse, knowledge of opioid harm, interest in learning about prescription opioids, and likelihood to practice misuse behaviors. This scale can help researchers understand adolescent perceptions and opinions about opioid safety.","output":"Psychometric validation of the AOSL scale using confirmatory factor analysis: A nationally representative sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Saccharomyces yeast compounds have been used as a resistance elicitor or for biological control in many pathosystems.

The control treatments consisted of distilled water and S. cerevisiae (25 mg of commercial product per mL) for the soybean tests and distilled water and acibenzolar-S-methyl (125 mg of active ingredient per L) for the sorghum tests. In soybeans the three tested S. boulardii products presented a dose-dependent effect with R2 of 0.64, 0.94 and 0.98 for the culture filtrate, cell suspension and commercial product of S. boulardii, respectively, with no effect of culture time of yeasts on phytoalexin induction. In sorghum, only the culture filtrate and Floratil presented a dose-dependent effect, with R2 of 0.63 and 0.94, respectively, and the cell suspension of S. boulardii showed dependence of culture time with R2 of 0.62. Thus, S. boulardii and its derivates induce phytoalexins and have potential to be used as an elicitor for assays with induction resistance in pathosystems involving sorghum and soybean plants.","output":"Indu??o De Fitoalexinas Em Soja E Sorgo Por Prepara??es De Saccharomyces Boulardii"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To study the effect of -elemene on the radiosensitivity of A549 cell xenograft tumor and potential mechanisms by which -elemene regulates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and glucose transporter protein-1 (GLUT-1). METHODS: Using an A549 cell transplantation tumor model with male nude mice, we studied the effect of -elemene on the radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression of HIF-1 and GLUT-1 was detected by real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the radiosensitivity of -elemene and the expression of HIF-1 and GLUT-1 was analyzed. RESULTS: -elemene and radiotherapy intervened in the growth of transplanted tumors in varying degrees. The enhancement factor (EF=2.44>1) was calculated; -elemene at 45 mg/kg had the most significant enhanced effect on radiosensitivity. When -elemene was used in combination with radiation, the expression of HIF-1 and GLUT-1 was significantly decreased, and there was a positive correlation between the two genes. CONCLUSION: -elemene exhibits a radiosensitizing effect on A549 cell xenograft tumor. The underlying molecular mechanism is probably associated with the down-regulation of HIF-1 and GLUT-1 expression, suggesting that -elemene may directly or indirectly inhibit the expression of HIF-1 and GLUT-1. There is a positive significant correlation between expression of HIF-1 and GLUT-1.

In March, vaccine eligibility in Alberta expanded to include FNMI peoples of younger ages and in urban settings. The Mtis Nation of Alberta (MNA) and other Indigenous organizations recognized that FNMI populations might be better served by tailored vaccine programs. INTERVENTION: The MNA is the government for the Mtis people in Alberta. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the MNA has supported its citizens, through financial and mental wellness support, access to personal protective equipment, and messaging regarding public health orders. When vaccines became available, culturally appropriate virtual vaccine information sessions were provided. In March 2021, the MNA delivered the first Mtis-led COVID-19 vaccination clinic. Unique to the clinics success was the location, online booking process, and community presence. The clinic focused on cultural safety, including the availability of Indigenous health professionals to community members, and cultural reference points throughout the clinic. OUTCOMES: In the first MNA clinic, over 1300 people were vaccinated. Visitors shared appreciation for the culturally specific aspects of the clinic, which contributed to increased safety and comfort. IMPLICATIONS: Based on the success of the first Mtis-led vaccination clinic, similar services in communities with high numbers of Mtis people have been approved. This innovative practice initiative could provide a model of COVID-19 vaccine service delivery that could be used to meet the needs of Mtis citizens in other jurisdictions in Canada.","output":"Practice report: an Alberta Mtis model for COVID-19 vaccine delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Oxford-Astra Zeneca COVID 19 vaccine (AZD1222 or ChAdOx1) is an important part of the global vaccine roll-out against SARS-CoV-2, and a locally manufactured version (Covishield by Serum Institute, Pune, India) is the most commonly used vaccine in India. The vaccination program started in January 2021 and here we report effectiveness of the first dose of Covishield in generating antibody response and its kinetics. We further report differences in the quantitative antibody response amongst individuals who had pre-existing antibodies to SARS CoV2 and those who did not. In a group of 135 healthcare workers administered Covishield, we measured antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 directed against the spike protein (S-antigen) using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S quantitative antibody detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) at days 0, 7, 14, and 28. In 44 subjects (32.5%) who had already developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at day 0 (before immunization), it was observed that antibody response was significantly higher at each time point, with the maximum increase seen between days 0 and 7. In contrast the sero-negative group (n=91) started developing antibody response only after 14 days or later. Three sero-negative individuals did not develop any antibody response even at day 28 of vaccination. It is noted that median antibody response at 28 days in seronegative subjects was similar to that of seropositive subjects at baseline (day 0) and was on a rising trajectory. Our data suggests that ChAdOx1 is highly immunogenic, particularly so where previous SARS CoV2 antibody-response is established.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) in a convenience sample of adolescents with obesity and to determine its association with the food educational style of their parent. METHODS: This observational study included 24 participants, 12 adolescents (8 boys and 4 girls) aged from 12 to 14 years and their 12 parents, who were followed in a specialized pediatric obesity clinic in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. The adolescents were asked to take a photograph with a smartphone application of all meals and beverages consumed in their daily routine over 14 consecutive days. They evaluated their parents food educational style using the Kids Child Feeding Questionnaire. The parent who was present at the study visits also completed the Feeding Style Questionnaire. A dietitian analyzed the pictures to extract food group portions and to identify UPFs using the NOVA classification. A nonparametric statistical test was used to investigate associations between UPF intake and food educational style. RESULTS: Overall, the adolescents had unbalanced dietary habits compared to national recommendations. They consumed an insufficient quantity of vegetables, fruits, dairy products, and starchy foods and an excessive amount of meat portions and sugary and fatty products compared to the current Swiss recommendations. Their consumption of UPFs accounted for 20% of their food intake. All adolescents defined their parent as being restrictive in terms of diet, with a mean parental restriction score of 3.3SD 0.4 (norm median=2.1). No parent reported a permissive food educational style. A higher intake of UPFs was associated with a lower parental restriction score (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Despite being followed in a specialized pediatric obesity clinic, this small group of adolescents had an unbalanced diet, which included 20% UPFs. The intake of UPFs was lower in participants whose parent was more restrictive, suggesting the importance of parents as role models and to provide adequate food at home.

Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin (HY/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide. However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns about the potential risk of QT interval prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP). Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the change in corrected QT (QTc) interval and arrhythmic events in patients with COVID-19 treated with HY/AZ. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 251 patients from 2 centers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with HY/AZ. We reviewed electrocardiographic tracings from baseline and until 3 days after the completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc interval and the incidence of arrhythmia and mortality. Results: The QTc interval prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion. Extreme new QTc interval prolongation to >500 ms, a known marker of high risk of TdP, had developed in 23% of patients. One patient developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia suspected as TdP, requiring emergent cardioversion. Seven patients required premature termination of therapy. The baseline QTc interval of patients exhibiting extreme QTc interval prolongation was normal. Conclusion: The combination of HY/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc interval in patients with COVID-19. This prolongation may be responsible for life-threatening arrhythmia in the form of TdP. This risk mandates careful consideration of HY/AZ therapy in light of its unproven efficacy.

This outbreak resulted in 774 deaths. However, the spatial features and potential determinants of SARS input-output flows remain unclear. METHODS: We used an adjusted spatial interaction model to examine the spatial effects and potential factors associated with SARS input-output flows. RESULTS: The presence of origin-based spatial dependence positively affected SARS input-output flows from the neighbours of the origin regions. Two components of the input-output flows, migrant and hospitalization flows, exhibited distinctive features. The origin-based and destination-based spatial dependence positively affected migrant flows (i.e., due to those seeking jobs) from the neighbours of origin and destination locations. Similarly, the destination-based spatial dependence also positively affected hospitalization flows (i.e., due to those seeking treatment) from the neighbours of destination regions. However, the origin-to-destination based spatial dependence negatively affected hospitalisation flows from the neighbours of origin-to-destination regions. The direct effects accounted for 78 % of the SARS input-output flows, which was 3.56-fold greater than the indirect effects. Differences in regional income drove the SARS input-output flows. Therefore, urban income had a positive effect, whereas rural income had a negative effect. Total interregional flows increased by 3.54 % with a 1 % increase in urban income, and intraregional flows increased by 8.35 %. In contrast, the total interregional flows decreased by 3.38 % with a 1 % increase in rural income, and intraregional flows declined by 2.29 %. Railway capacity, per person gross domestic product (PGDP), urban rate and the law of distance decay also affected the input-output flows. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the SARS input-output flows presented significant geographic spatial heterogeneity and spatial effects. Income differences were the major cause of the flows between pairs of regions. Railway capacity, PGDP, and urban rate also played important roles.

PURPOSE: To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case-control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence). Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19. LIMITATION: Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables. CONCLUSION: High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients. Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

Despite tremendous efforts and resources spent worldwide trying to explore antiviral drugs, there is still no effective clinical treatment for COVID-19 to date. Approximately 15% of COVID-19 cases progress to pneumonia, and patients with severe pneumonia may die from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis from SARS-CoV-2 infection further leads to ARDS, often resulting in irreversible impairment of lung function. If the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily causes an immune response or immune cell infiltration can be identified, it may be possible to mitigate excessive immune responses by modulating the infiltration and activation of specific targets, thereby reducing or preventing severe lung damage. However, the extent to which immune cell subsets are significantly altered in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients remains to be elucidated. This study applied the CIBERSORT-X method to comprehensively evaluate the transcriptional estimated immune infiltration landscape in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients and further compare it with the lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We found a variety of immune cell subtypes in the COVID-19 group, especially na?ve B cells were highly infiltrated. Comparison of functional transcriptomic analyses revealed that non-differentiated na?ve B cells may be the main cause of the over-active humoral immune response. Using several publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to validate the genetic differences in B-cell populations, it was found that the B-cells collected from COVID-19 patients were inclined towards na?ve B-cells, whereas those collected from IPF patients were inclined towards memory B-cells. Further differentiation of B cells between COVID-19 mild and severe patients showed that B cells from severe patients tended to be antibody-secreting cells, and gene expression showed that B cells from severe patients were similar to DN2 B cells that trigger extrafollicular response. Moreover, a higher percentage of B-cell infiltration seems associated with poorer clinical outcome. Finally, a comparison of several specific COVID-19 cases treated with targeted B-cell therapy suggests that appropriate suppression of na?ve B cells might potentially be a novel strategy to alleviate the severe symptoms of COVID-19.","output":"In silico immune infiltration profiling combined with functional enrichment analysis reveals a potential role for na?ve B cells as a trigger for severe immune responses in the lungs of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While lymphocytopenia is a common characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the mechanisms responsible for this lymphocyte depletion are unclear. Here, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and immunological data from 18 fatal COVID-19 cases, results showed that these patients had severe lymphocytopenia, together with high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10), and elevation of many other mediators in routine laboratory tests, including C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, &#945;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and natriuretic peptide type B. The spleens and hilar lymph nodes (LNs) from six additional COVID-19 patients with post-mortem examinations were also collected, histopathologic detection showed that both organs manifested severe tissue damage and lymphocyte apoptosis in these six cases. In situ hybridization assays illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA accumulates in these tissues, and transmission electronic microscopy confirmed that coronavirus-like particles were visible in the LNs. SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid protein (NP) accumulated in the spleens and LNs, and the NP antigen restricted in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) positive macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 triggered the transcription of Il6, Il8 and Il1b genes in infected primary macrophages and DCs in vitro, and SARS-CoV-2-NP+ macrophages and DCs also manifested high levels of IL-6 and IL-1?, which might directly decimate human spleens and LNs and subsequently lead to lymphocytopenia in vivo.

Nearly half of the pediatric patients had a history of asthma (49%). Total IgE, total IgG, and IgG1-3 were similar in those positive and negative to SARS-CoV-2. Median total IgG4 in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group was nearly three times (p-value = 0.02) that of the negative group. Atopy controller medications did not confer additional benefit.

A pool testing approach may shorten the screening time and increase the test rate during times of limited test availability and inadequate reporting speed. Pool testing has been effectively used for a wide variety of infectious disease screening settings. Historically, it originated from serological testing in syphilis. During the current COVID-19 pandemic pool testing is considered across the globe to inform opening strategies and monitor infection rates after interventions were implemented. OBJECTIVES This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the global efforts to implement pool testing, specifically for screening of COVID-19. SOURCES Data were retrieved from a detailed search for peer-reviewed articles and preprint reports using Medline/PubMed, medRxiv, Web of Science, and Google up to March 21, 2021, using search terms \\"pool testing\\", \\"viral\\", \\"serum\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"COVID-19\\". CONTENT This review summarizes the history and theory of pool testing. We identified numerous peer-reviewed articles that describe specific details and practical implementation of pool testing. Successful examples as well as limitations of pool testing, in general and specifically related to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies, are reviewed. While promising, significant operational, pre-analytical, logistical, and economic challenges need to be overcome to advance pool testing. IMPLICATIONS The theory of pool testing is well understood and numerous successful examples are available from the past. Operationalization of pool testing requires sophisticated processes that are adopted to the local medical circumstances. Special attention needs to be paid to sample collection, sample pooling, and strategies to avoid re-sampling.","output":"Sample pooling: strain or solution?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a valuable asset to facilitate clinical research and point of care applications; however, many challenges such as data privacy concerns impede its optimal utilization.

METHODS: REUMAVID is a cross-sectional study using an online survey developed by an international multidisciplinary patient-led collaboration across seven European countries targeting unselected patients with RMDs. Healthcare access, daily activities, disease activity and function, well-being (WHO Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)), health status, anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) and access to information were evaluated. Data were collected in April-July 2020 (first phase). RESULTS: Data from the first phase included 1800 patients with 15 different RMDs (37.2% axial spondyloarthritis, 29.2% rheumatoid arthritis, 17.2% osteoarthritis and others). Mean age was 53, 80% female and 49% had undertaken university studies. During the beginning of the pandemic, 58.4% had their rheumatology appointment cancelled and 45.6% reported not having received any information relating to the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in their RMDs, with the main source being patient organisations (27.6%).Regarding habits, 24.6% increased smoking, 18.2% raised their alcohol consumption, and 45.6% were unable to continue exercising. Self-reported disease activity was high (5.32.7) and 75.6% reported elevated pain. Half the patients (49.0%) reported poor well-being (WHO-5) and 46.6% that their health had changed for the worse during lockdown. According to HADS, 57.3% were at risk of anxiety and 45.9% of depression. CONCLUSION: Throughout the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with RMDs have experienced disruption in access to healthcare services, poor lifestyle habits and negative effects on their overall health, well-being and mental health.

To assess whether olfactory dysfunction could be used as a diagnostic marker for COVID-19 positivity and aid public health approaches in tackling the current outbreak. METHODS: We systematically searched MedLine (PubMed), Embase, Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC), Medrxiv, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, NIHR Dissemination centre, Clinical Evidence, National Health Service Evidence and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence to identify the current published evidence which associates coronaviridae or similar RNA viruses with anosmia. The initial search identified 157 articles. A total of 145 papers were excluded following application of our exclusion criteria. The 12 remaining articles that presented evidence on the association between COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction were critically analysed. RESULTS: Olfactory dysfunction has been shown to be the strongest predictor of COVID-19 positivity when compared to other symptoms in logistic regression analysis. In patients who had tested positive for COVID-19, there was a prevalence of 62% of OD. In populations of patients who are currently reporting OD, there is a positive predictive value of 61% for a positive COVID-19 result. CONCLUSION: Our review has shown that there is already significant evidence which demonstrates an association between OD and the novel coronavirus-COVID-19. It is unclear if this finding is unique to this coronavirus as individual viral phenotypes rarely present in such concentrated large numbers. We have demonstrated that OD is comparatively more predictive for COVID-19 positivity compared to other associated symptoms. We recommend that people who develop OD during the pandemic should be self-isolate and this guidance should be adopted internationally to prevent transmission.","output":"Is loss of sense of smell a diagnostic marker in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In a phase III clinical trial, casirivimab and imdevimab (CAS+IMD) reduced the composite endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalizations or all-cause mortality in outpatients at risk of severe disease.

A high initial or peak severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) load in nasopharyngeal specimens was shown to be associated with a high mortality rate. Because all infected individuals were devoid of preeexisting protective immunity against SARS-CoV, the biological basis for the variable virus burdens in different patients remains elusive. Methods. The nationwide SARS database in Taiwan was analyzed, and genotyping of 281 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 65 genes was performed for 94 patients with SARS, to identify SNPs for which distribution between patients with or without detectable nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV was biased. Results. Titers of SARS-CoV shed in nasopharyngeal specimens varied widely, ranging from nondetectable to 10(8) SARS-CoV RNA copies/mL, and they were correlated positively with a high mortality rate (P < .0001, by trend test) and with early death (i.e., death occurring within 2 weeks of the onset of illness) (P = .0015, by trend test). Virus shedding was found to be higher among male patients (P = .0014, by multivariate logistic regression) and among older patients (P = .015, by multivariate logistic regression). Detectable nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV was associated with polymorphic alleles of interleukins 18 (P = .014) and 1A (P = .031) and a member of NFB complex (reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B [RelB]) (P = .034), all of which are proinflammatory in nature, as well as the procoagulation molecule fibrinogen-like protein 2 (P = .008).

However, there is a need to improve our understanding about how these interventions work, for whom and in which contexts, to make the best use of the increasing investment in the provision and delivery of befriending services. METHODS: A realist evaluation was undertaken as it focuses on uncovering causal processes and interactions between mechanisms and contextual characteristics. Five case studies of befriending programmes in Northern Ireland were studied, reflecting variation in contextual variables, service user and provider characteristics. Data was collected via service documentation and semi-structured interviews (n = 46) with stakeholders involved in the delivery and receipt of befriending interventions. RESULTS: Eight initial programme theories were generated, which were tested in the case study analysis to uncover context-mechanism-outcome relationships. Mechanisms identified included reciprocity, empathy, autonomy, and privacy which were triggered in different contexts to support the alleviation of loneliness and social isolation. Reciprocity was triggered in contexts where service users and befrienders shared characteristics, the befriender was a volunteer and befriending took the form of physical companionship. Contexts characterised in terms of shared experiences between befriender and service user triggered empathy. Autonomy was triggered in contexts where befriending relationships were delivered long-term and did not focus on a pre-defined set of priorities. Privacy was triggered in contexts where service users had a cognitive/sensory impairment and received one-to-one delivery. CONCLUSION: This study improves understanding about how and why befriending interventions work. Findings indicate that services should be tailored to the needs of service users and take into consideration characteristics including mobility, impairments e.g. physical, sensory and/or cognitive, as well as the influence of service characteristics including payment for befrienders, fixed/long-term befriending relationship, one-to-one support and the impact of non-verbal communication via face-to-face delivery.","output":"How do befriending interventions alleviate loneliness and social isolation among older people?

Maintaining or increasing publicly accessible urban greenspaces, particularly for marginalised groups, is reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals, and its importance amplified in the COVID-19 pandemic. Urban greenspaces should be considered a public health and social investment and a chance to rebalance our relationship with nature to protect against future pandemics. By investing in urban public greenspaces, additional benefits (job/food creation, biodiversity promotion, carbon sequestration) may coincide with health benefits. Realising these requires a shift in the balance of decision making to place weight on protecting, enhancing and providing more appropriate greenspaces designed with local communities. The current pandemic is a reminder that humanity placing too many pressures on nature has damaging consequences. COVID-19 economic recovery programs present an opportunity for sustainable transformation if they can be leveraged to simultaneously protect and restore nature and tackle climate change and health inequalities.","output":"A call to action: Improving urban green spaces to reduce health inequalities exacerbated by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experimentally, it has been proved that cadmium served as an effective carcinogen and able to induce tumors in rodents in a dose-specific manner.

In the present study, an attempt has been made to establish cadmium-induced human prostate carcinogenesis using an in vitro model of BPH cells. Wide range of cadmium concentrations, i.e., 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM and 1M, were chronically exposed to the human BPH cells for transformation into PCa and monitored using cell and molecular biology approaches. After eight weeks of exposure, the cells showed subtle morphological changes and shifts of cell cycle in the G2M phase. Significant increase in expression of prostatic genes AR, PSA, ER-?, and 5&#945;R with increased nuclear localization of AR and pluripotency markers Cmyc, Klf4 indicated the carcinogenic effect of Cd. Further, the BPH cells exposed to Cd showed a substantial increase in the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9, influencing migratory potential of the cells along with decreased expression of the p63 protein which further strengthen the progression towards carcinogenesis and aggressive tumor studies. Data from the present study state that Cd exhibited marked invasiveness in BPH cells. These observations established a connecting link of BPH towards PCa pathogenesis.

In SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral RNA may persist in respiratory samples for several weeks after the resolution of symptoms. Criteria to assess the end of infectivity are not unequivocally defined. In some countries, time from diagnosis is the unique criterion used, in addition to symptom cessation. This study evaluates the role of the Lumipulse(?) Antigen Assay (LAA) for the safe end of isolation of patients 21 days after the diagnosis of infection. Methods. A total of 671 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients diagnosed with infection at least 21 days before were assessed by RT-PCR and LAA, and the role of LAA in predicting the absence of infectivity was evaluated by virus cell culture. Results. Viable virus was present in 10/138 cultured samples. Eight out of ten infective patients suffered from a concomitant disease, predisposing them to long-term shedding of infective virus. In particular, infectious virus was isolated from 10/20 RT-PCR+/LAA+ cultured samples, whereas no viable virus was found in all 118 RT-PCR+/LAAC cultured swabs. LLA and RT-PCR agreed in 484/671 (72.1%) samples, with 100% and 26.7% concordance in RT-PCR negative and positive samples, respectively. Conclusions. Viable virus can be found 21 days after diagnosis in immunocompromised or severely ill patients. LAA better than RT-PCR predicts non-infectivity of patients and can be safely used to end isolation in cases with long persistence of viral RNA in the respiratory tract.","output":"Role of Nucleocapsid Protein Antigen Detection for Safe End of Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients with Long Persistence of Viral RNA in Respiratory Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Family/caregiver visitation provides critical support for patients confronting cancer and is associated with positive outcomes. However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought historic disruptions including widespread visitation restrictions. Here, we characterize in-depth the visitor policies of NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers (CCCs) and analyze geographic/temporal patterns across CCCs. METHODS: The public-facing CCC websites, including archived webpages, were reviewed to abstract initial visitation policies and revisions, including end-of-life (EoL) exceptions and timing of visitation restrictions relative to regional lockdowns. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were employed to analyze associations between geographic region, timing, and severity of restrictions. RESULTS: Most CCCs (n=43, 86%) enacted visitation restrictions between March 15 and April 15, 2020. About half barred all visitors for COVID-negative inpatients (n=24, 48%) or outpatients (n=26, 52%). Most (n=36, 72%) prohibited visitors for patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Most (n=40, 80%) published EoL exceptions but the specifics were highly variable. The median time from initial restrictions to government-mandated lockdowns was 1 day, with a wide range (25 days before to 26 days after). There was no association between timing of initial restrictions and geographic location (p=0.14) or severity of inpatient policies (p=1.0), even among centers in the same city. Outpatient policies published reactively (after lockdown) were more restrictive than those published proactively (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: CCCs enacted strict but strikingly variable COVID-19 visitation restrictions, with important implications for patients/families seeking cancer care.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to gain knowledge about postgraduate nursing students experiences with the use of LMS in a subject in an advanced practice nursing master's programme. METHODS: A qualitative method with a descriptive design was employed. Two focus group interviews were performed with eight postgraduate nursing students from an advanced practice nursing programme at a university college in Norway. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the data material: 1) A course structure that supports learning; 2) LMS tools facilitate preparation, repetition and flexibility; and 3) own responsibility for using the LMS for preparation before on-campus activities. CONCLUSION: The course structure within the LMS seemed to be important to enhance postgraduate students ability to prepare before on-campus activities. Implementation and use of LMS tools can facilitate preparation, repetition and flexibility, especially when postgraduate students study difficult topics.

OBJECTIVES To investigate whether obesity is associated with worse postural balance and fear of falling in older adults. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted with 201 older adults, classified as normal weight, overweight, or obese according to BMI. Postural balance was evaluated on stable and unstable surfaces on the Biodex Balance System platform under three visual conditions: with and without visual feedback and with eyes closed. Fear of falling was identified by a dichotomous question and the Falls Efficacy Scale. These data were compared between groups and included in adjusted multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS The study showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in body oscillations on a stable surface between the three groups. On an unstable surface, the obese older adults exhibited body oscillations from 0.61 [95% CI 0.07, 1.30] to 1.63 [95% CI 0.84, 2.41] greater than those with normal weight in the three visual conditions. The obese older adults also displayed larger mediolateral oscillations with visual feedback (mean difference: 0.50 [95% CI 0.01, 0.98]) as well as greater global oscillations without visual feedback (mean difference of 0.82 [95% CI 0.18, 1.81]) and with progressive instability (mean difference: 0.80 [95% CI 0.05, 1.66]) than the overweight older adults.

After an input parameter customization, a classification analysis of malaria and dengue records took place, quantified by the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. This classification yielded a high accuracy, with more than 90% of the records correctly labelled in some cases, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach proposed. This approach, after further studies, or combined with more measures such as Sample Entropy, is certainly very promising in becoming an early diagnosis tool based solely on body temperature temporal patterns, which is of great interest in the current Covid-19 pandemic scenario.","output":"Fever Time Series Analysis Using Slope Entropy.

Allocation of these resources to those most likely to benefit can be supported by clinical prediction models.

MAIN BODY: We review three issues of importance for microallocation: (1) Prediction of benefit (or of medical futility) may be technically very challenging; (2) When resources are scarce, calibration is less important for microallocation than is ranking to prioritize patients, since capacity determines thresholds for resource utilization; (3) The concept of group fairness, which is not germane in shared decision-making, is of central importance in microallocation. Therefore, model transparency is important. CONCLUSION: Prediction supporting allocation of life-saving interventions should be explicit, data-driven, frequently updated and open to public scrutiny.

To prevent this scenario a nationwide relocation concept was developed. METHODS: For the development of the concept publicly available infection rates of the leading infection authority in Germany were used. Within this concept six medical care regions (clusters) were designed around a center of maximum intensive care (ECMO option) based on the number of intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants. The concept describes the management structure including a structural chart, the individual tasks, the organization and the cluster assignment of the clinics. The transfers of intensive care patients within and between the clusters were recorded from 11 December 2020 to 31 January 2021. RESULT: In Germany and Baden-Wrttemberg, 1.5% of patients newly infected with SARS-CoV-2 required intensive care treatment in mid-December 2020. With a 7-day incidence of 192 new infections in Germany, the hospitalization rate was 10% and 28-35% of the intensive care beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients. Only 16.8% of the intensive care beds were still available, in contrast to 35% in June 2020. The developed relocation concept has been in use in Baden-Wrttemberg starting from 10 December 2020. From then until 7 February 2021, a median of 24a? 5/54 intensive care patients were transferred within the individual clusters, in total 154 intensive care patients. Between the clusters, a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 15 (median 12.5) patients were transferred, 21 intensive care patients were transferred to other federal states and 21 intensive care patients were admitted from these states. The total number of intensive care patients transferred was 261. CONCLUSION: If the number of infections with SARS-CoV-2 increases, a nationwide relocation concept for COVID-19 intensive care patients and non-COVID-19 intensive care patients should be installed at an early stage in order not to overwhelm the capacities of hospitals. Supply regions around a leading clinic with maximum intensive care options are to be defined with a central management that organizes the necessary relocations in cooperation with regional and superregional rescue service control centers. With this concept and the intensive care transports carried out, it was possible to effectively prevent the overload of individual clinics with COVID-19 patients in Baden-Wrttemberg.

This workflow extracts the most important information from large input data and stores it in smaller derived data objects. The derived data objects can then be used for further analysis tasks. Typically, those workflows use distributed storage and computing resources. A straightforward configuration of storage media would be low cost tape storage and higher cost disk storage. The large, infrequently accessed input data is stored on tape storage. The smaller, frequently accessed derived data is stored on disk storage. In a best case scenario, the large input data is only accessed very infrequently and in a well planned pattern. However, practice shows that often the data has to be processed continuously and unpredictably. This can significantly reduce tape storage performance. A common approach to counter this is storing copies of the large input data on disk storage. This contribution evaluates an approach that uses cloud storage resources to serve as a flexible cache or buffer depending on the computational workflow. The proposed model is elaborated for the case of continuously processed data. For the evaluation, a simulation was developed, which can be used to evaluate models related to storage and network resources. We show that using commercial cloud storage can reduce the on-premises disk storage requirements, while maintaining an equal throughput of jobs. Moreover, the key metrics of the model are discussed and an approach is described that uses the simulation to assist with the decision process of using commercial cloud storage.

We used a mixed methods approach to assess care home mortality by country, how the deaths compared with previous periods, and how excess deaths may be explained. We retrieved national datasets for 25 countries on mortality, 17 cohort studies assessing deaths compared to a previous period, and 16 cohort studies reporting interventions or factors associated with excess mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted those living in care homes at the highest risk for severe outcomes. However, the pandemic only highlighted and exacerbated a long-running problem: underfunding, poor structural layout, undertraining, under-skilling, under-equipping, and finally, lack of humanity in dealing with the most vulnerable members of society. The 17 cohort studies point to excess mortality worsening during the pandemic. Despite involving vast numbers of care homes around the globe, the quality of the evidence is not good. For example, the majority of the studies infer the cause of extra deaths from the observation window (mainly the spring of 2020) rather than through detailed investigations. This is why we do not draw any clear conclusions about the specific causes of death, apart from noting their significantly high numbers. In addition, we did not review all policy actions since 2020 but note there has been a scarcity of studies since then - an indicator that interest in this problem has waned and likely not been addressed. Analysis of national datasets for 25 countries shows that care home deaths were, on average, 30% of the total COVID-19 deaths (range: 9-64%). The quality of the current evidence base is limited, short term, and lacks standardised methods to prevent robust countrywide comparisons. Residual excess deaths were also observed, with excess mortality being reported for both COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Several reported interventions or factors suggest the potential to mitigate the risk in care homes substantially. Interventions that could reduce mortality include improving the care home quality, increasing staffing levels, reducing the number of beds in the facility, employing staff confinement strategies with residents, and improving clinical care such as implementing daily examinations. Some care home solutions like US 'Green House' homes, which usually have fewer than 12 beds, may provide crucial insights into the care home problem compared with larger homes. Furthermore, care home residents faced barriers accessing emergency treatments during the pandemic waves. Finally, interventions targeting care homes should be subject to smaller trials given large effect sizes in some studies. Approximately one per cent of the global population resides in care homes, while care home residents account for nearly one-third of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the 25 countries studied. Reducing this ratio requires analysing current care home infrastructures, funding models, and incentives for providing high-quality care. The scale of the problem in care homes requires robust evaluation and coordinated strategies to improve outcomes for those most vulnerable to COVID-19. Failure to address these systemic problems could mean global care home populations will be similarly affected by future crises and pandemics.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 in Care Homes - A Mixed Methods Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Present two clinical cases of cerebral circulation disorders in COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 13,500 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized between March 1 and May 30, 2020. RESULTS: Of 13,500 patients with COVID-19, twelve had imaging-proved cerebral venous thrombosis with an incidence of 8.8 per 10,000 during 3 months, which is considerably higher than the reported incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis in the general population of 5 per million annually. There was a male preponderance (8 men, 4 women) and an average age of 49 years (95% CI, 36-62 years; range, 17-95 years). Only 1 patient (8%) had a history of thromboembolic disease. Neurologic symptoms secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis occurred within 24 hours of the onset of the respiratory and constitutional symptoms in 58% of cases, and 75% had venous infarction, hemorrhage, or both on brain imaging. Management consisted of anticoagulation, endovascular thrombectomy, and surgical hematoma evacuation. The mortality rate was 25%.

In humans, the major classes of host defence peptides include the - and -defensins and the cathelicidin, hCAP-18/LL-37. These peptides are expressed in the granules of neutrophils and by a wide variety of tissue types. They have many roles in the immune response including both indirect and direct antimicrobial activity, the ability to act as chemokines as well as induce chemokine production leading to recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection, the promotion of wound healing and an ability to modulate adaptive immunity. It appears that many of these properties are mediated though direct interaction of peptides with the cells of the innate immune response including monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells and epithelial cells. The importance of these peptides in immune responses has been demonstrated since animals defective in the expression of certain host defence peptides showgreater susceptibility to bacterial infections. In the very few instances in which human patients have been demonstrated to have defective host defence peptide expression, these individuals suffer from frequent infections. Although studies of the immunomodulatory properties of these peptides are in their infancy, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the immunomodulatory properties of these small, naturally occurring molecules might be harnessed for development as novel therapeutic agents.","output":"Immunomodulatory Properties of Defensins and Cathelicidins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPACT: This study will help to characterize the root causes of racial and ethnic disparities in viral respiratory outbreaks and determine the extent to which this is unique to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that preventative interventions can be designed for future pandemics and epidemics. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The causes of racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 clinical outcomes are multifactorial but include social inequity driven by structural racism. This study seeks to characterize the patterns of these disparities by linking patient-level EHR data with population-level sociodemographic measures. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: This retrospective review of adult patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the UCHealth System will compare rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality across racial and ethnic groups. Race and ethnicity are determined by patient self-report in the EHR. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses will be used to assess the association of these outcomes with sociodemographic factors. Potential confounders that will be adjusted for include Charlson Co-morbidity Index, disease severity and likelihood of readmission. Using chi-square tests, we will assess differences in the race/ethnicity distributions between this cohort and those from the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic and the 2018-19 influenza season. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Of the first 459 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in March and April 2020, race/ethnicity were: 194 Hispanic (42.3%), 104 non-Hispanic Black (22.6%), 83 non-Hispanic white (18.1%), 43 Asian (9.4%), and 35 other or unknown race (7.6%). There were significant differences in the race/ethnicity distribution compared to the cohort of patients hospitalized for viral respiratory infection during the 2018-19 influenza season (n=254, p <0.001): 58 Hispanic (22.8%), 52 non-Hispanic black (20.4%), 116 non-Hispanic white (45.7%), 15 Asian (6%), and 13 other or unknown race (5.1%).

Evidence suggests that, especially in adolescence, all processes should be considered in the assessment and treatment of patients with clinically relevant psychopathology. The SCRAM (Sleep, Circadian Rhythms, and Mood) questionnaire was developed and validated in a student sample as a promising tool to conjointly measure and separate sleep, circadian preference and depression symptomatology. The present study aims to validate a German version of the SCRAM questionnaire in an adolescent psychiatric inpatient sample. A two-step analytic strategy consisting of an exploratory factor analysis EFA followed by confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) was conducted. The EFA was run in the first half of the sample (n = 422, M = 14.92, SD = 1.67). To validate the factor structure of the EFA and the original study, two CFA\`s were performed in the second half of the adolescent sample (n = 438, M = 15.07, SD = 1.68). The EFA analysis revealed a 4-factor model with 12 items. Two Sleep items and one Morningness item had cross-factor loadings. The fit indices in the CFA were good using the factor model of the original study, whereas the 4-factor model of the EFA did not converge.

METHODS: Data on a sample of 593 older individuals in Taiwan were collected between April and July 2020. Multiple regression analyses were performed to test the hypothesized relationships. RESULTS: As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan continuously declined from April 2020, participants who were interviewed in May, June and July experienced significantly fewer COVID-19-related worries and social disruptions than those interviewed in April. The month interviewed, representing the pandemic development phase of COVID-19, moderated the relationships between home-based service (HBS) use and COVID-19 worries. Month interviewed also moderated the association between COVID-19-related social disruptions and depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Differences in the level of COVID-19-related worries between HBS users and non-users were greatest in April, followed by May, and least in June and July, suggesting that the disparities between HBS users and non-users attenuated over time. Perceived high COVID-19-related social disruptions was weakly and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms in April, but the relationship became moderately positive in May, and strongly positive in June and July. These results supported the claim that the associations between COVID-19-related social disruptions and depressive symptoms can vary over time.

Online teaching is not new, but some faculty have not taught in a virtual environment and rapidly transitioning courses online was challenging. It is not known if teacher self-efficacy was impacted by these circumstances. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess online teacher self-efficacy of nursing faculty who transitioned at least one-face-to face course to an online format. We hypothesized that faculty with previous online teaching experience and greater self-rated instructional support would demonstrate higher online teacher self-efficacy scores compared to faculty who had little or no online teaching experience or reported less satisfaction with instructional support. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. SETTING: Faculty from ten universities across the United States were recruited. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing faculty (N = 84) who transitioned at least one face-to-face course to an online format during COVID-19 were included in the study. METHODS: Participants completed the 32-item Michigan Nurse Educators Sense of Efficacy for Online Teaching (MNESEOT) instrument and a demographic questionnaire which included items about prior online teaching experience and instructional support. RESULTS: Participants scored overall teacher self-efficacy high (75th percentile). Computer skills were scored highest while student engagement scored lowest. Prior online teaching was a predictor of higher online teacher self-efficacy; however, instructional support was not a predictor of higher online teacher self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Nursing faculty reported a high level of online teacher self-efficacy during an abrupt pivot from face-to-face teaching to a virtual format. Pre-emptive opportunities to teach online can build self-efficacy for novice faculty.

Telehealth visits offer potential cost savings for patients and families, which may vary by region of the world studied. Also, aggressiveness of the care patients receive may differ, and patients or families may be more likely to choose one visit type over another based on seizure control. This is a prospective face-to-face clinic versus telehealth clinic visit comparison study involving patients with seizures, their legal guardians, and caretakers who attend clinic. We compared travel distance, work-related factors, childcare, satisfaction of care, changes in seizure medication or diagnostics tests ordered, and willingness to cancel appointments to better understand the behavioral patterns of patients, caretakers, and providers. Our results indicate that many patients and families still prefer in-person interactions with their medical providers. Patient and family satisfaction levels were equal with both visit types. No significant difference was seen in medical management between face-to-face and telehealth visits. Also, prior seizure control did not dictate the type of visit chosen. Telehealth participants were significantly more willing to cancel appointments if asked to switch to face-to-face then face-to-face participants asked to complete telehealth visits. Surprisingly, we found that patients and families choosing telehealth were not statistically more likely to be employed or take less time off work. Also, distance from home to office was not significantly shorter for participants choosing face-to-face visits. Offering a combination of telehealth and face-to-face visits appears to be the optimal strategy in caring for patients with controlled and uncontrolled seizure disorders to ensure adherence with clinic visits and satisfaction with care.

Thus, wearables and smartphones should play a significant role in combating COVID-19 through the early detection supported by other contextual data and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In this paper, we investigate the role of the heart measurements (i.e., HRV and BPM) collected from wearables and smartphones in demonstrating early onsets of the inflammatory response to the COVID-19.

Among the stories currently circulating in US-focused social media forums are ones suggesting that the 5G telecommunication network activates the virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it as cover to launch a broad vaccination program to facilitate a global surveillance regime.

The elderly, commonly defined as subjects aged 65 years, are among the at-risk subjects recommended for annual influenza vaccination in European countries. Currently, two new vaccines are available for this population: the MF59-adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (aQIV) and the high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (hdQIV). Their multidimensional assessment might maximize the results in terms of achievable health benefits. Therefore, we carried out a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of the aQIV by adopting a multidisciplinary policy-oriented approach to evaluate clinical, economic, organizational, and ethical implications for the Italian elderly. Methods. A HTA was conducted in 2020 to analyze influenza burden; characteristics, efficacy, and safety of aQIV and other available vaccines for the elderly; cost-effectiveness of aQIV; and related organizational and ethical implications. Comprehensive literature reviews/analyses were performed, and a transmission model was developed in order to address the above issues. Results. In Italy, the influenza burden on the elderly is high and from 77.7% to 96.1% of influenza-related deaths occur in the elderly. All available vaccines are effective and safe; however, aQIV, such as the adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV), has proved more immunogenic and effective in the elderly. From the third payers perspective, but also from the societal one, the use of aQIV in comparison with egg-based standard QIV (eQIV) in the elderly population is cost-effective. The appropriateness of the use of available vaccines as well as citizens knowledge and attitudes remain a challenge for a successful vaccination campaign. Conclusions. The results of this project provide decision-makers with important evidence on the aQIV and support with scientific evidence on the appropriate use of vaccines in the elderly.","output":"The New Quadrivalent Adjuvanted Influenza Vaccine for the Italian Elderly: A Health Technology Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Randomized trial evidence on the risk/benefit ratio of thrombolysis for mild stroke is limited. We sought to determine the efficacy of intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV r-tPA) in a subset of patients with mild deficit in the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). METHODS IST-3 compared IV r-tPA with control within 6 hours of onset in patients for whom IV r-tPA was considered promising but unproven. Analysis was restricted to subjects randomized within 3 hours of onset with a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 5, pretreatment blood pressure <185/110, and no other r-tPA exclusion criteria. We compared r-tPA and control arms for primary (Oxfordshire Handicap Score [OHS] 0-2) and secondary (ordinal OHS and OHS 0-1) outcomes at 6 months. RESULTS Among 3035 IST-3 subjects, 612 (20.2%) had an National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 5; of these 106 (17.6%) met the restricted criteria. Allocation to r-tPA was associated with an increase in OHS 0 to 2 (84% r-tPA versus 65% control; adjusted odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-8.79) and a favorable shift in OHS distribution (adjusted odds ratio, 2.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-4.85). There was no significant effect of r-tPA on OHS 0 to 1 (60% versus 51%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-4.43). CONCLUSIONS This post hoc analysis in a highly selected sample of IST-3 supports the rationale of A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Activase (Alteplase) in Patients With Mild Stroke (PRISMS) trial-a randomized, phase IIIb study to evaluate IV r-tPA in mild ischemic stroke.","output":"Effect of Intravenous Recombinant Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator in Patients With Mild Stroke in the Third International Stroke Trial-3: Post Hoc Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Double membrane vesicles (DMVs) in coronavirus-infected cells feature pores that span both membranes.

I describe a predicted luminal binding interface between nsp3 and nsp4 that is membrane-associated, conserved in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic and in diverse coronaviruses, and stable in molecular dynamics simulation. Combined with structure predictions for the full-length nsp4 monomer and cryo-EM data, this suggests a DMV pore model in which nsp4 spans both membranes with nsp3 and nsp4 inserted into the same bilayer.

Approach: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online for understanding skin injuries among medical staff fighting COVID-19 in February 8-22, 2020. Participants voluntarily answered and submitted the questionnaire with cell phone. The questionnaire items included demographic data, grade of PPE and daily wearing time, skin injury types, anatomical sites, and preventive measures. Univariable analyses and logistic regression analyses were used to explore the risk factors associated with skin injuries. Results: A total of 4,308 respondents were collected from 161 hospitals and 4,306 respondents were valid. The overall prevalence of skin injuries was 42.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41.30-44.30) with three types of device-related pressure injuries, moist-associated skin damage, and skin tear. Co-skin injuries and multiple location injuries were 27.4% and 76.8%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis indicated that sweating (95% CI for odds ratio [OR] 87.52-163.11), daily wearing time (95% CI for OR 1.61-3.21), male (95% CI for OR 1.11-2.13), and grade 3 PPE (95% CI for OR 1.08-2.01) were associated with skin injuries. Only 17.7% of respondents took prevention and 45.0% of skin injuries were treated. Innovation: This is the first cross-sectional survey to understand skin injuries in medical staff caused by PPE, which is expected to be a benchmark. Conclusion: The skin injuries among medical staff are serious, with insufficient prevention and treatment.

Monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusions were developed to promote passive immunity. Analysis of the first 200 patients who received SARS-CoV-2 mAb at our hospital showed a 27 % absolute reduction in hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits. Understanding the role of SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapy in management of the SOT population is likely to inform decision making for these patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of SOT patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who received mAb therapy between 11/18/20 and 04/26/21. Patients were excluded if they were < 18 years of age or if they weighed < 40 kg. We compared those patients who were hospitalized or visited the ED within 29 days of mAb therapy to those who recovered without further visits to our hospital. RESULTS: A total of 50 SOT patients receiving mAb therapy were included in this analysis. Bamlanivimab was given to 33 patients, while 9 patients received bamlanivimab/etesevimab and 8 patients received casirivimab/imdevimab. Twelve (24 %) patients were hospitalized or visited the ED within 29 days of mAb therapy; 38 patients did not. These 2 groups did not significantly differ by age, gender, body mass index, time from SOT, or other risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness per FDA Emergency Use Authorization guidance. Both groups were primarily made up of kidney transplant recipients (66.7 % and 68.4 %, respectively). Significantly more patients in the hospitalization/ED group were receiving antimetabolites as part of their immunosuppression (IS) regimen prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (100 % vs 68.4 %, p = 0.047). Patients in the hospitalization/ED group received mAbs within a median of 6 days (IQR 3.8) of symptom onset compared to 4 days (IQR 4) (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: SOT recipients were more likely to be hospitalized or visit the ED due to COVID-19 after mAb if they were receiving antimetabolite IS or received mAb later after symptom onset. These data stress the importance of early mAb administration in all SOT patients, particularly in those on antimetabolite therapy.

Achieving optimal nutritional treatment during these phases in critically ill patients is challenging. COVID-19 patients seem particularly difficult to feed due to gastrointestinal problems. Our aim was to describe measured resting energy expenditure (mREE) and feeding practices and tolerance during the acute and late phases of critical illness in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Observational study including critically ill mechanically ventilated adult COVID-19 patients. Indirect calorimetry (Q-NRG+, Cosmed) was used to determine mREE during the acute (day 0-7) and late phase (>day 7) of critical illness. Data on nutritional intake, feeding tolerance and urinary nitrogen loss were collected simultaneously. A paired sample t-test was performed for mREE in both phases. RESULTS: We enrolled 21 patients with a median age of 59 years [44-66], 67% male and median BMI of 31.5 kg/m2 [25.7-37.8]. Patients were predominantly fed with EN in both phases. No significant difference in mREE was observed between phases (p = 0.529). Sixty-five percent of the patients were hypermetabolic in both phases. Median delivery of energy as percentage of mREE was higher in the late phase (94%) compared to the acute phase (70%) (p = 0.001). Urinary nitrogen losses were significant higher in the late phase (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: In both the acute and late phase, the majority of the patients were hypermetabolic and fed enterally. In the acute phase patients were fed hypocaloric whereas in the late phase this was almost normocaloric, conform ESPEN guidelines. No significant difference in mREE was observed between phases. Hypermetabolism in both phases in conjunction with an increasing loss of urinary nitrogen may indicate that COVID-19 patients remain in a prolonged acute, catabolic phase.","output":"Energy expenditure and feeding practices and tolerance during the acute and late phase of critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To test the benefits of Solumedrol treatment in sepsis patients with a blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-cortisol response (delta <13 g/dL) with regard to the number of days on ventilator, days on intravenous blood pressure support, length of time in an intensive care unit (ICU), 14-day mortality, and 28-day mortality. The trial was prospective, randomized, and double-blind. As part of a larger sepsis trial, 54 patients with sepsis had an intravenous ACTH stimulation test using 250 g of ACTH, and serum cortisol was measured at times 0, 30, and 60 min. Eleven patients failed to increase their cortisol concentration above 19.9 g/dL and were excluded from the clinical trial as they were considered to have adrenal insufficiency. The remaining 43 patients had a baseline cortisol of 32  1 g/dL increased to 38  3 g/dL at 30 min and 40  3 at 60 min. All cortisol responses were <12.9 g/dL between time 0 and time 60, which is defined as a blunted cortisol response to intravenous ACTH administration. Twenty-one were randomized to receive 20 mg of intravenous Solumedrol and 22 were randomized to receive a matching placebo every 8 h for 7-days. There was no significant difference between the two randomized groups. Data analysis was carried out bya two-tailed test and P < .05 as significant. RESULTS Results: The mean age was 51  2 (mean  SEM) with 61% female. Groups were well matched with regard to APACHE III score in Solumedrol versus placebo (59  6 vs 59  6), white blood cell count (18.8  2.2 vs 18.6  2.6), and incidence of bacteremia (29 vs 39%). The 28-day mortality rate was reduced in the Solumedrol treated arm (43  11 vs 73  10%; P < .05). There was no change in days in ICU, days on blood pressure agents, or days on ventilator. Seven days of high-dose intravenous Solumedrol treatment (20 mg every 8 h) in patients with a blunted cortisol response to ACTH was associated with an improved 28-day survival. This small study suggests that an inability to increase endogenous cortisol production in patients with sepsis who are then provided steroid treatment could improve survival.","output":"Solumedrol Treatment for Severe Sepsis in Humans with a Blunted Adrenocorticotropic Hormone-Cortisol Response: A Prospective Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Pilot Clinical Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 necessitated a rapid shift to telehealth for psychologists offering consultation-liaison services in pediatric medical settings.

We investigated the viral cause and clinical presentation among 50 patients. METHODS: We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked. FINDINGS: Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients. By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus. INTERPRETATION: A coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease. Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression.","output":"Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preclinical and early clinical studies suggest that angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme type 2 activity may be impaired in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); therefore, administration of exogenous angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) may be beneficial.

AIM To investigate the relationship between all-cause mortality and body mass index in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS This retrospective study included patients with community-acquired pneumonia hospitalized in the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao from June 2013 to November 2018. The patients were grouped as underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5-23.9 kg/m2), and overweight/obesity ( 24 kg/m2). The primary outcome was all-cause hospital mortality. RESULTS Among 2327 patients, 297 (12.8%) were underweight, 1013 (43.5%) normal weight, and 1017 (43.7%) overweight/obesity. The all-cause hospital mortality was 4.6% (106/2327). Mortality was lowest in the overweight/obesity group and highest in the underweight group (2.8%, vs 5.0%, vs 9.1%, P < 0.001). All-cause mortality of overweight/obesity patients was lower than normal-weight patients [odds ratio (OR) = 0.535, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.334-0.855, P = 0.009], while the all-cause mortality of underweight patients was higher than that of normal-weight patients (OR = 1.886, 95%CI: 1.161-3.066, P = 0.010). Multivariable analysis showed that abnormal neutrophil counts (OR = 2.38, 95%CI: 1.55-3.65, P < 0.001), abnormal albumin levels (OR = 0.20, 95%CI: 0.06-0.72, P = 0.014), high-risk Confusion-Urea-Respiration-Blood pressure-65 score (OR = 2.89, 95%CI: 1.48-5.64, P = 0.002), and intensive care unit admission (OR = 3.11, 95%CI: 1.77-5.49, P < 0.001) were independently associated with mortality.

As a first step toward the generation of oral vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we have expressed a recombinant S1 protein of the SARS-CoV in transformed tobacco. Since plant transformation and regeneration of stable transformants require considerable time, we initially used a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to tag the antigen in transient expression. GFP was fused to the carboxy-terminus of S1 for expression of S1-GFP to show expression of recombinant S1 by agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves. The GFP tag enables a relatively quick confirmation of antigen expression in plant cells by fluorescent microscopy.

We investigated the Prokr1 signaling pathways and its metabolic function in murine myoblast, satellite cells, and their differentiated myotubes. We measured the expression levels of Prokr1 in the skeletal muscle of mice as well as human skeletal muscle cell-derived myotubes. Prokineticin 2 (PROK2), a ligand of PROKR1, induced calcium mobilization in a dose-dependent manner and altered the mRNA levels of 578 genes in PROKR1-overexpressed HEK293T cells. Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes revealed that PROKR1 activated Gq-mediated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in skeletal muscle cells. Prokr1 significantly activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in myotubes derived from C2C12 and satellite cells, regardless of the presence or absence of insulin. Prokr1 also promoted the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) into the plasma membrane. In palmitate-induced insulin-resistant myotubes, Prokr1 enhanced insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake. mRNA and protein levels of Prokr1 were significantly decreased in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice, and the amount of PROKR1 protein was significantly decreased in human skeletal muscle cell-derived myotubes under insulin resistance conditions.

METHODS: We reviewed the records of 498 adults admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital, NY, from 3/1 to 4/15, 2020 with COVID-19 requiring high-?ow O2 (non-rebreather mask, Venturi mask with FiO2 >50%, or high-?ow nasal cannula). We excluded those (N=29) who received mechanical ventilation (MV) or died within 24h of admission. We followed patients until death or discharge. We compared outcomes between patients who received early steroids (i.e. prior to MV) and those who did not. We used adjusted Cox models to evaluate the composite of death or need for MV. We also evaluated healthcare resources utilization. RESULTS: Of 469 patients, 175 (37.3%) received steroids while on high flow O2. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics. Patients who received steroids were more likely to have asthma, had slightly longer duration of symptoms, lower O2 saturation, higher NT-proBNP and lower IL-6 levels at baseline. In total, 228 patients (48.6%) reached the composite endpoint (123 died and 105 received MV). By 7 days, 32.5% of patients who received steroids died or were intubated vs. 44.8% of those who did not (log-rank P=0.008), Figure 1. In models adjusted for race, age, sex, comorbidities, baseline O2 saturation and procalcitonin, steroids reduced risk for death or MV by 44% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56; 95%CI 0.42C0.76; P< 0.001). The effect was time-dependent with initial HR 0.34 (95%CI 0.21C0.56; P< 0.001) and daily attenuation by 10.2% (95%CI 1.7%C19.4%; P=0.017).

This is important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as companion animal guardians may be less negatively affected by the pandemic. This research examined the influence of companion animals, and specifically ornamental fishes, on mental well-being and loneliness during the pandemic. Data were collected via an online survey and interviews with companion animal guardians. Companion animal guardianship alone was not linked to loneliness or well-being during the pandemic, but there was evidence that people who interacted more with their dogs (and to a lesser extent cats) were lonelier and had poorer well-being; possibly, these individuals spent more time with their dogs/cats because they were more isolated. Open-ended survey responses and interview data identified that most people felt their companion animals were a positive influence during the pandemic, but ornamental fishes were perceived as having a less positive effect than other companion animals, possibly because they cannot provide comfort via physical touch. Consistent with past research, these findings indicate that people believe their companion animals positively influenced their lives during the pandemic, but there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support these beliefs. ABSTRACT: To reduce the spread of COVID-19, countries worldwide placed limitations on social interaction, which is anticipated to have severe psychological consequences. Although findings are inconsistent, prior research has suggested that companion animals may positively influence human well-being and reduce loneliness. In the context of COVID-19, this has important implications, as companion animal guardians may be less negatively affected by the pandemic. The primary aim of this research was to investigate the influence of companion animals on mental well-being and loneliness during the pandemic, with specific interest in the role of ornamental fishes. A mixed-methods study was conducted, using an international sample. Quantitative data were collected via an online survey (n = 1199) and analysed using robust hierarchical multiple regression analyses; the influence of level of engagement with companion animals was examined for dogs, cats and ornamental fishes. There was no evidence that companion animal guardianship was associated with loneliness and mental well-being during the pandemic but spending more time engaging physically or socially with dogs (and to a lesser extent cats) was generally associated with poorer outcomes. Qualitative data were collected through open-ended survey responses (n = 757) and semi-structured interviews (n = 25) and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Two themes were developedone related to companion animals as providers of social and emotional support, and the other to companion animals as providers of purpose and perspective. Concerns regarding the impact of the pandemic on animal welfare were also identified. Compared to other animal types, more participants expressed indifference regarding the impact of their fishes on their well-being during the pandemic, possibly because fishes cannot provide comfort via physical touch. The findings of this study reflect the wider field of humanCanimal interaction; although qualitative data suggest guardians believe their companion animals are a positive influence in their lives, there is little convincing quantitative data to support these beliefs. This highlights the need to refine theories regarding which aspects of companion animal guardianship may influence human well-being; the findings from this research may be useful in the refinement of such theories.","output":"Companion Animal Type and Level of Engagement Matter: A Mixed-Methods Study Examining Links between Companion Animal Guardianship, Loneliness and Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Proning intubated intensive care unit patients for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome is an accepted standard of practice.

This study further examined the origin, risk factors, and outbreaks caused by beta-CoVs. We searched the following databases for relevant studies: PubMed, Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database. A close relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS bat-like CoV RaTG13 (98.9%) was found at the amino acid level, followed by pangolin CoVs. Non-synonymous mutations occur at high frequencies in the open reading frame (ORF) 1ab, spike (S) protein, and nucleocapsid. Mutations P323L and D614G in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and S protein, respectively, occur at a high frequency globally. Mutations at position 3037 in the nonstructural protein (Nsp) 3, 14408 (RdRp), and 23403 (S) confer transmissibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has higher infectivity and transmissibility than SARS-CoV, which shares the same receptor. Although bats are confirmed reservoirs, intermediate hosts are currently unknown. Smoking, old age, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension have all been associated with COVID-19. Within six months of its outbreak, COVID-19 was reported in all countries worldwide, whereas SARS was reported in 28 countries and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 5 countries. However, the fatality rate of MERS (65%) was higher than that of COVID-19 (4.9%) and SARS (6.6%). Identifying the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts will help prevent future outbreaks. Attention should be given to the pangolin CoVs. Variations in the S gene may confer transmissibility and infectivity.

The impact of restrictions on which patients undergo surgical procedures and their perioperative outcomes is less understood. METHODS: Adult patients who underwent medically necessary surgical procedures at our institution during a restricted operative period due to the COVID-19 pandemic (March 23-April 24, 2020) were compared to patients undergoing procedures during a similar time period in the pre-COVID-19 era (March 25-April 26, 2019). Cardinal matching and differences in means were utilized to analyze perioperative outcomes. RESULTS: 857 patients had surgery in 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 212 patients had surgery in 2020 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 era cohort had a higher proportion of patients who were male (61.3% vs. 44.5%, P < 0.0001), were White (83.5% vs. 68.7%, P < 0.001), had private insurance (62.7% vs. 54.3%, p 0.05), were ASA classification 4 (10.9% vs. 3%, P < 0.0001), and underwent oncologic procedures (69.3% vs. 42.7%, P < 0.0001). Following 1:1 cardinal matching, COVID-19 era patients (N = 157) had a decreased likelihood of discharge to a nursing facility (risk difference-8.3, P < 0.0001) and shorter median length of stay (risk difference-0.6, p 0.04) compared to pre-COVID-19 era patients. There was no difference between the two patient cohorts in overall morbidity and 30-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 restrictions on surgical operations were associated with a change in the racial and insurance demographics in patients undergoing medically necessary surgical procedures but were not associated with worse postoperative morbidity. Further study is necessary to better identify the causes for patient demographic differences.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Demographics and Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Medically Necessary Non-Emergent Surgeries During the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Registered nurses (RNs) regularly adapt their work to ever-changing situations but routine adaptation transforms into RN strain when service demand exceeds staff capacity and patients are at risk of missed or delayed care. Dynamic monitoring of RN strain could identify when intervention is needed, but comprehensive views of RN work demands are not readily available. Electronic care delivery tools such as nurse call systems produce ambient data that illuminate workplace activity, but little is known about the ability of these data to predict RN strain. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of ambient workplace data, defined as time-stamped transaction records and log file data produced by non-electronic health record care delivery tools (e.g., nurse call systems, communication devices), as an information channel for automated sensing of RN strain. METHODS: In this exploratory retrospective study, ambient data for a 1-year time period were exported from electronic nurse call, medication dispensing, time and attendance, and staff communication systems. Feature sets were derived from these data for supervised machine learning models that classified work shifts by unplanned overtime. Models for three timeframes -8, 10, and 12 hours-were created to assess each model's ability to predict unplanned overtime at various points across the work shift. RESULTS: Classification accuracy ranged from 57 to 64% across three analysis timeframes. Accuracy was lowest at 10 hours and highest at shift end. Features with the highest importance include minutes spent using a communication device and percent of medications delivered via a syringe. CONCLUSION: Ambient data streams can serve as information channels that contain signals related to unplanned overtime as a proxy indicator of RN strain as early as 8 hours into a work shift. This study represents an initial step toward enhanced detection of RN strain and proactive prevention of missed or delayed patient care.","output":"Registered Nurse Strain Detection Using Ambient Data: An Exploratory Study of Underutilized Operational Data Streams in the Hospital Workplace"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Children with medical complexity (CMC) have inter-related health and social needs; however, interventions to identify and respond to social needs have not been adapted for CMC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing social needs screening and assessment within pediatric complex care programs. METHODS: We implemented systematic social needs assessment for CMC (SSNAC) at two tertiary care centers in three phases: (1) pre-implementation, (2) implementation, and (3) implementation monitoring. We utilized a multifaceted implementation package consisting of discrete implementation strategies within each phase. In phase 1, we adapted questions from evidence-informed screening tools into a 21-item SSNAC questionnaire, and we used published frameworks to inform implementation readiness and process. In phases 2C3, clinical staff deployed the SSNAC questionnaire to parents of CMC in-person or by phone as part of usual care and adapted to local clinical workflows. Staff used shared decision-making with parents and addressed identified needs by providing information about available resources, offering direct assistance, and making referrals to community agencies. Implementation outcomes included fidelity, feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness. RESULTS: Observations from clinical staff characterized fidelity to use of the SSNAC questionnaire, assessment template, and shared decision-making for follow-up on unmet social needs. Levels of agreement (5-point Likert scale; 1 = completely disagree; 5 = completely agree) rated by staff for key implementation outcomes were moderate to high for acceptability (mean = 4.7; range = 3C5), feasibility (mean = 4.2; range = 3C5), and appropriateness (mean = 4.6; range = 4-5). 49 SSNAC questionnaires were completed with a 91% response rate. Among participating parents, 37 (76%) reported  1 social need, including food/nutrition benefits (41%), housing (18%), and caregiver needs (29%). Staff responses included information provision (41%), direct assistance (30%), and agency referral (30%). CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible for tertiary care center-based pediatric complex care programs to implement a standardized social needs assessment for CMC to identify and address parent-reported unmet social needs.

Since carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression in both colon and breast cancers is correlated with poor prognosis, it was chosen as a model tumor target in immunocompetent CEA transgenic (CEATg) mice. A second-generation anti-CEA CAR derived from CEA-specific antibody T84.66 was used to treat murine MC38 colon or E0771 breast carcinomas transfected with CEA. Anti-CEA CAR vs. mock transduced T cells exhibited a CEA-specific cytotoxic and IFN[Image: see text] dose response to both CEA transfected cell lines vs. their CEA-negative controls. Anti-CEA CAR vs. mock transduced T cells delayed the median survival of CEA transfected s.c. MC38 or orthotopic E0771 tumor-bearing CEATg mice by 2 days. With the addition of one-day prior cyclophosphamide (CY) lymphodepletion, anti-CEA CAR T cell treatment delayed the median survival of MC38/CEA and E0771/CEA tumor-bearing CEATg mice by ten and 3 days, respectively. Since CAR T cells require IL2 for survival and expansion, anti-CEA-IL2 immunocytokine (ICK) treatment was performed post CAR T cell therapy. Single ICK treatment 1 day after CY plus anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy in the MC38/CEA model, and two ICK treatments every 3 days after CY plus anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy in the E0771/CEA model were ineffective, while four ICK treatments every 3 days after CY plus anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy completely eradicated MC38/CEA tumor growth and induced tumor immunity when the mice were re-challenged with tumor. These studies show the therapeutic potential of anti-CEA CAR T cells combined with ICK to treat CEA-positive tumors.

Expression profiles represent snapshots of combined genetic, socio-environmental (including socioeconomic and environmental factors), and physiological effects on the molecular phenotype. As such, they have potential to improve biological understanding of differences among populations, and provide therapeutic biomarkers and environmental mitigation strategies. Here, we undertook a large-scale assessment of patterns of gene expression between African Americans and European Americans, mining RNA-Seq data from 25 non-diseased and diseased (tumor) tissue-types. We observed the widespread enrichment of pathways implicated in COVID-19 and integral to inflammation and reactive oxygen stress. Chemokine CCL3L3 expression is up-regulated in African Americans. GSTM1, encoding a glutathione S-transferase that metabolizes reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics, is upregulated. The little-studied F8A2 gene is up to 40-fold more highly expressed in African Americans; F8A2 encodes HAP40 protein, which mediates endosome movement, potentially altering the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2. African American expression signatures, superimposed on single cell-RNA reference data, reveal increased number or activity of esophageal glandular cells and lung ACE2-positive basal keratinocytes. Our findings establish basal prognostic signatures that can be used to refine approaches to minimize risk of severe infection and improve precision treatment of COVID-19 for African Americans. To enable dissection of causes of divergent molecular phenotypes, we advocate routine inclusion of metadata on genomic and socio-environmental factors for human RNA-sequencing studies.","output":"African Americans and European Americans exhibit distinct gene expression patterns across tissues and tumors associated with immunologic functions and environmental exposures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apesar de sua ampla distribui??o geogrfica e do grande nmero de exemplares mantidos em cativeiro, estudos bsicos sobre a fisiologia ocular de macacos-prego da espcie Sapajus libidinosus ainda s?o incipientes.

The pathophysiology of COVID-19 remains unclear, posing a great challenge to the medical management of patients. Recent studies have reported an unusually high prevalence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients, although the mechanism remains elusive. Several studies have reported the presence of aPLs in COVID-19 patients. We have noticed similarities between COVID-19 and APS, which is an autoimmune prothrombotic disease that is often associated with an infective aetiology. Molecular mimicry and endothelial dysfunction could plausibly explain the mechanism of thrombogenesis in acquired APS.

The addition of one or multiple PEG moieties, in either linear or branched form, is known to carry the risk of potentially inducing an immunogenic response against PEG. The importance of accurately quantifying anti-PEG antibodies during a clinical study is well recognized and stems from the fact that anti-PEG antibodies have been shown to negatively impact the efficacy of the biotherapeutic that the PEG is coupled to. As a consequence, sponsors are encouraged to develop immunogenicity assays to assess appropriately the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against the protein component as well as the PEG. However, detection of anti-PEG antibodies is complicated by a number of technical challenges, including the availability of appropriate positive control material. In addition, the fact that some anti-PEG antibodies are known to circulate as low-affinity IgM, drives the need for an assay able to detect low affinity anti-PEG ADA even in the presence of high concentrations of the biotherapeutic. To address this need, we developed and validated an Affinity Capture Elution (ACE)-AGL assay to detect anti-drug and anti-PEG antibodies. In this assay, which we call ACE-AGL, ADA are captured by biotin-PEG-drug, acid eluted and re-captured on a second plate coated with protein AGL. ADA are then detected using Ruthenium-PEG-drug. The new assay format described is highly sensitive to both anti-drug and anti-PEG antibodies and very drug-tolerant. The ACE-AGL assay is easy to perform and has been successfully validated at two separate CROs. We propose the ACE-AGL format as a valid and effective alternative to the currently available assay methods.","output":"Development and validation of a novel immunogenicity assay to detect anti-drug and anti-PEG antibodies simultaneously with high sensitivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Its been 50 years since Women in Cell Biology (WICB) was founded by junior women cell biologists who found themselves neither represented at the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) presentations nor receiving the information, mentoring, and sponsorship they needed to advance their careers.

The very structure of the model limits the ability to infer numerical values for the parameters, a concept referred to as structural identifiability. Most of the available methods to test the structural identifiability of a model are either too complex mathematically for the general practitioner to be applied, or require involved calculations or numerical computation for complex non-linear models. In this work, we present a new analytical method to test structural identifiability of models based on ordinary differential equations, based on the invariance of the equations under the scaling transformation of its parameters. The method is based on rigorous mathematical results but it is easy and quick to apply, even to test the identifiability of sophisticated highly non-linear models. We illustrate our method by example and compare its performance with other existing methods in the literature. Author summary Theoretical Biology is a useful approach to explain, generate hypotheses, or discriminate among competing theories. A well-formulated model has to be complex enough to capture the relevant mechanisms of the problem, and simple enough to be fitted to data. Structural identifiability tests aim to recognize, in advance, if the structure of the model allows parameter fitting even with unlimited high-quality data. Available methods require advanced mathematical skills, or are too costly for high-dimensional non-linear models. We propose an analytical method based on scale invariance of the equations. It provides definite answers to the structural identifiability problem while being simple enough to be performed in a few lines of calculations without any computational aid. It favorably compares with other existing methods.","output":"Testing structural identifiability by a simple scaling method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the 12 months since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, an explosion of investigation and an increase in experience have led to vast improvement in our knowledge about this disease.

Currently, there are a number of combination drugs developed against various viral infections to arrest the activity of same or different viral macromolecules at multiple stages of its life cycle; among which majority are targeted to interfere with the replication of viral genome. Besides these, other type of antiviral molecules includes entry inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, interferons, immunomodulators, etc. The antiviral drugs can be toxic to human cells, particularly in case of administration of combination drugs, and on the other hand viruses can grow resistant to the antiviral drugs. Furthermore, emergence of new viruses like Ebola, coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) emphasizes the need for more innovative strategies to develop better antiviral drugs to fight the existing and the emerging viral infections.

After one year, alpha-blocker usage decreased significantly (LP 94.44C61.11%, p = 0.001, SP 73.96C46.15%, p = 0.001); other medication usage and self-catheterization rates remained unchanged. Compared to SP patients, differences in passing trial void (LP 94.44%, SP 93.45%), postoperative UTI (LP 19.44%, SP 10.12%), ED visits (LP 22.22%, SP 17.86%), readmissions (LP 8.33%, SP 4.76%), and retreatment (LP 8.33%, SP 4.76%) were insignificant. However, mean days to foley removal (LP 9, SP 5.71, p = 0.003) and urosepsis rates (LP 5.56%, SP 0.00%, p = 0.002) differed. CONCLUSION: In select LP patients, Rezum provided short-term symptomatic relief and improved voiding function comparable to SP patients. Postoperatively, though alpha-blocker usage decreased significantly, use of other medications did not change, and nearly two-thirds of patients still needed alpha-blockade. Further efforts should explore the possibility of expanding Rezums inclusion criteria.","output":"Rezum therapy for patients with large prostates ( 80 g): initial clinical experience and postoperative outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cleavage and activation of hemagglutinin (HA) by trypsin-like proteases in influenza A virus (IAV) are essential prerequisites for its successful infection and spread. In host cells, some transmembrane serine proteases such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT, along with plasmin in the bloodstream, have been reported to cleave the HA precursor (HA(0)) molecule into its active forms, HA(1) and HA(2). Some trypsinogens can also enhance IAV proliferation in some cell types (e.g., rat cardiomyoblasts). However, the precise activation mechanism for this process is unclear, because the expression level of the physiological activator of the trypsinogens, the TMPRSS15 enterokinase, is expected to be very low in such cells, with the exception of duodenal cells. Here, we show that at least two variant enterokinases are expressed in various human cell lines, including A549 lung-derived cells. The exogenous expression of these enterokinases was able to enhance the proliferation of IAV in 293T human kidney cells, but the proliferation was reduced by knocking down the endogenous enterokinase in A549 cells. The enterokinase was able to enhance HA processing in the cells, which activated trypsinogen in vitro and in the IAV-infected cells also. Therefore, we conclude that enterokinase plays a role in IAV infection and proliferation by activating trypsinogen to process viral HA in human cell lines.","output":"Enterokinase Enhances Influenza A Virus Infection by Activating Trypsinogen in Human Cell Lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogenic agent of Coronavirus-Induced Disease-2019 (COVID-19), a multi-organ syndrome which primarily targets the respiratory system. In this review, considering the large amount of data pointing out the role of the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) in the inflammatory response and in the modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, we describe some mechanisms that strongly suggest its involvement in the management of COVID-19s inflammatory framework. It regulates both the expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) and its stabilizing partner, the Broad neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (B(0)AT1). It induces Indolamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO-1), the enzyme which, starting from Tryptophan (Trp), produces Kynurenine (Kyn, Beta-Anthraniloyl-L-Alanine). The accumulation of Kyn and the depletion of Trp arrest T cell growth and induce apoptosis, setting up an immune-tolerant condition, whereas AhR and interferon type I (IFN-I) build a mutual inhibitory loop that also involves NF-kB and limits the innate response. AhR/Kyn binding boosts the production of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), thus reinforcing the inflammatory state and counteracting the IDO-dependent immune tolerance in the later stage of COVID-19. Taken together, these data depict a framework where sufficient clues suggest the possible participation of AhR in the management of COVID-19 inflammation, thus indicating an additional therapeutic target for this disease.","output":"Hypothesis: Emerging Roles for Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor in Orchestrating CoV-2-Related Inflammation ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent decades there have been multiple pathogens, viruses and bacteria, which have emerged as causal agents of pneumonia affecting adults, albeit less frequently, to children.

These problems might be overcome using helium-oxygen gas mixture. However, the effect of mechanical ventilation with heliox in these patients is unclear. The objective of this prospective cross-over study was to determine the effects of mechanical ventilation with heliox 60/40 versus conventional gas on respiratory system resistance, air-trapping and CO2 removal. METHODS: Mechanically ventilated, sedated and paralyzed infants with proven RSV were enrolled within 24 hours after paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)admission. At T = 0, respiratory system mechanics including respiratory system compliance and resistance, and peak expiratory flow rate were measured with the AVEA ventilator. The measurements were repeated at each interval (after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox, after 30 minutes of ventilation with nitrox and again after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox). Indices of gas exchange (ventilation and oxygenation index) were calculated at each interval. Air-trapping (defined by relative change in end-expiratory lung volume) was determined by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) at each interval. RESULTS: Thirteen infants were enrolled. In nine, EIT measurements were performed. Mechanical ventilation with heliox significantly decreased respiratory system resistance. This was not accompanied by an improved CO2 elimination, decreased peak expiratory flow rate or decreased end-expiratory lung volume. Importantly, oxygenation remained unaltered throughout the experimental protocol.

However, inhalation dosimetry data in remodeled airways are scarce due to the challenges in reconstructing diseased respiratory morphologies. This study aims to study the airway remodeling effects on the inhalation dosimetry of nasally inhaled nanoparticles in a nose-lung geometry that extends to G9 (ninth generation).Materials and methods: Statistical shape modeling was used to develop four diseased lung models with varying levels of bronchiolar dilation/constriction in the left-lower (LL) lobe (i.e. M1-M4). Respiratory airflow and particle deposition were simulated using a low Reynolds number k- turbulence model and a Lagrangian tracking approach.Results: Significant discrepancies were observed in the flow partitions between the left and right lungs, as well as between the lower and upper lobes of the left lung, which changed by 10-fold between the most dilated and constricted models.Much lower doses were predicted on the surface of the constricted LL bronchioles G4-G9, as well as into the peripheral airways beyond G9 of the LL lung. However, the LL lobar remodeling had little effect on the dosimetry in the nasopharynx, as well as on the total dosimetry in the nose-lung geometry (up to G9).Conclusion: It is suggested that airway remodeling may pose a higher viral infection risk to the host by redistributing the inhaled viruses to healthy lung lobes. Airway remodeling effects should also be considered in the treatment planning of inhalation therapies, not only because of the dosimetry variation from altered lung morphology but also its evolution as the disease progresses.","output":"Inhalation dosimetry of nasally inhaled respiratory aerosols in the human respiratory tract with locally remodeled conducting lungs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report theoretical calculations of the static ground-state structures and pressure-induced phase transformations of four cerium hydrides: CeH, CeH2, CeH2.5, and CeH3.

Although many proteins have been discovered and identified, a large part of proteins encoded by genes are yet to be discovered or fully characterized. In the present study, we successfully identified a host protein C11orf96 that was significantly upregulated after viral infection. RESULTS: First, we successfully cloned the coding sequence (CDS) region of the cat, human, and mouse C11orf96 gene. The CDS region of the C11orf96 gene is 372 bp long, encodes 124 amino acids, and is relatively conserved in different mammals. From bioinformatics analysis, we found that C11orf96 is rich in Ser and has multiple predicted phosphorylation sites. Moreover, protein interaction prediction analysis revealed that the protein is associated with several transmembrane family proteins and zinc finger proteins. Subsequently, we found that C11orf96 is strictly distributed in the cytoplasm. According to the tissue distribution characteristics, C11orf96 is distributed in all tissues and organs, with the highest expression levels in the kidney. These results indicate that C11orf96 may play a specific biological role in the kidney.

METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL, Informit and Google Scholar were systematically searched to identify qualitative studies-published from January 2008-that included data from Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples about their concerns and priorities related to food and nutrition. Data were extracted from included studies using a pre-determined template and study quality was assessed using the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Quality Appraisal Tool. Qualitative findings were synthesised using inductive thematic analysis and categorised based on an ecological model of health. RESULTS Twenty-one studies were included. Key factors influencing food and nutrition were identified across all levels of the ecological framework. These included interpersonal and institutional racism, junk food availability and marketing, food accessibility and affordability, housing conditions, food knowledge and cooking skills, and connection to family and culture. CONCLUSIONS Documenting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' lived experiences of the colonised food system is one step necessary for informing policy to tackle food and nutrition inequities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cephalogram images for 234 subjects (167 females and 67 males) were traced and classified for groups by gender, age, and dentofacial skeletal patterns. Size, shape, and bridging of ST were assessed. Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) analysis was used to detect the interaction between gender, age, and skeletal patterns on ST dimensions. RESULTS: The mean values for length, anteroposterior diameter, and depth of ST were 8.02  1.67, 11.37  1.60, and 8.56  1.26 mm, respectively. A significant difference in length of ST between gender and age stages (p < 0.05) was detected while older subjects revealed a greater anteroposterior diameter than younger subjects (p < 0.05).

Epimedium might have the potential to be developed as agents to treat osteoporosis. The present systematic review and meta-analysis integrating Western medicine and Eastern medicine (WE medicine) was to evaluate the efficacy of Epimedium on osteoporosis. Methods: Eleven electronic databases were searched to identify the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Epimedium as an adjunctive or alternative versus conventional pharmacotherapy during osteoporosis. Bone mineral density (BMD), effective rate, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were measured as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were pain relief time, bone metabolic markers, and adverse events. Research quality evaluation was conducted according to the modified Jadad scale. Review Manager 5.4 was utilized to perform analyses, and the data were pooled using a random-effect or fixed-effect model to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD), standardized mean difference (SMD), risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Twelve RCTs recruiting 1,017 patients were eligible. Overall, it was possible to verify that, in the Epimedium plus conventional pharmacotherapy group, BMD was significantly improved (p = 0.03), effective rate was significantly improved (p = 0.0001), and VAS was significantly decreased (p = 0.01) over those in control group. When compared to conventional pharmacotherapy, Epimedium used alone improved BMD (p = 0.009) and effective rate (p < 0.0001). VAS was lower (p < 0.00001), and the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was significantly decreased (p = 0.01) in patients taking Epimedium alone compared with those given conventional pharmacotherapy. Results of subgroup analyses yielded that the recommended duration of Epimedium as an adjuvant was >3 months (p = 0.03), the recommended duration of Epimedium as an alternative was 3 months (p = 0.002), and Epimedium decoction brought more benefits (SMD = 2.33 [1.92, 2.75]) compared with other dosage forms. No significant publication bias was identified based on statistical tests (t = 0.81, p = 0.440). Conclusions: Epimedium may improve BMD and effective rate and relieve pain as an adjuvant or alternative; Epimedium as an alternative might regulate bone metabolism, especially ALP, with satisfying clinical efficacy during osteoporosis.

METHODS: An online survey was conducted amongst CR participants from May to October 2020, COVID-19-related lockdown restrictions. Anthropometric data, participant-determined levels of motivation and self-perceived efficacy, CR practices etc., pre- and post-lockdown, were collected. RESULTS: The probability of practicing CR in public gyms and hospitals decreased 15-fold (47.2% pre-, 5.6% post-lockdown; OR[95% CI] 0.065[0.013; 0.318], p < 0.001), and 34-fold (47.2% pre, 2.8% post; OR[95% CI] 0.029[0.004; 0.223], p < 0.001), respectively. Amongst participants, 79.5% indicated that their CR goals had changed and were 78% less likely to engage in CR for socialization after lockdown (47.2% pre, 16.7% post; OR[95% CI] 0.220[0.087; 0.555]; p = 0.002). The probability of receiving in-person supervision decreased by 90% (94.4% pre, 16.7% post; OR[95% CI] 0.011[0.002; 0.056]), while participants were almost 7 times more likely to use online supervision (11.1% pre, 44.4% post; OR[95% CI] 6.824[2.450; 19.002]) (both p < 0.001).

A recent longitudinal cohort from Italy including 143 patients followed up after hospitalisation with COVID-19 reported that 87% had at least one ongoing symptom at 60-day follow-up. Early indications suggest that patients with COVID-19 may need even more psychological support than typical intensive care unit patients. The assessment of risk factors for longer term consequences requires a longitudinal study linked to data on pre-existing conditions and care received during the acute phase of illness. The primary aim of this study is to characterise physical and psychosocial sequelae in patients post-COVID-19 hospital discharge. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an international open-access prospective, observational multisite study. This protocol is linked with the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) and the WHOs Clinical Characterisation Protocol, which includes patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 during hospitalisation. This protocol will follow-up a subset of patients with confirmed COVID-19 using standardised surveys to measure longer term physical and psychosocial sequelae. The data will be linked with the acute phase data. Statistical analyses will be undertaken to characterise groups most likely to be affected by sequelae of COVID-19. The open-access follow-up survey can be used as a data collection tool by other follow-up studies, to facilitate data harmonisation and to identify subsets of patients for further in-depth follow-up. The outcomes of this study will inform strategies to prevent long-term consequences; inform clinical management, interventional studies, rehabilitation and public health management to reduce overall morbidity; and improve long-term outcomes of COVID-19.

This dependency relationship intensifies during times of uncertainty or crisis. Although several recent studies have focused on media dependence during health crises such as SARS and H1N1 influenza, insights from eastern countries may not be validated in other hemisphere. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to adopt a cross-cultural lens to examine how participants from three different continents used media during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 860 adults completed a survey during April and May 2020. Participants were asked to provide demographic and socioeconomic details, followed by questions measuring their media consumption, channel preferences, motivations, and perception of their well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results revealed that national culture had a strong influence on media use and preferences during the COVID-19 crisis. For example, the US participants spent the most time using the media but scored the lowest on well-being. This aligns with the claim that in individualistic countries people rely on media more than on their social network. US participants also used the media for surveillance goals more than their Thai or Croatian counterparts. Another cultural difference was that Thai participants reported using the media to relax more than other nationalities, which reflects the Thai's way of life and can explain their higher score on well-being. Finally, there were cultural differences in the use of social media. While Croatian and Thai participants' use of social media reflected collectivistic tendencies (using social media for social interaction), among Americans, social media use reflects individualistic trends (using social media for surveillance). The study discusses limitations and suggestions for future research.","output":"Media and interpersonal channels uses and preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic: the case of the United States, Thailand, and Croatia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Successful PCR starts with proper priming between an oligonucleotide primer and the template DNA. However, the inevitable risk of mismatched priming cannot be avoided in the currently used primer system, even though considerable time and effort are devoted to primer design and optimization of reaction conditions. Here, we report a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) which contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker. The linker assumes a bubble-like structure which itself is not involved in priming, but rather delineates the boundary between the two parts of the primer. This structure results in two primer segments with distinct annealing properties: a longer 5-segment that initiates stable priming, and a short 3-segment that determines target-specific extension. This DPO-based system is a fundamental tool for blocking extension of non-specifically primed templates, and thereby generates consistently high PCR specificity even under less than optimal PCR conditions. The strength and utility of the DPO system are demonstrated here using multiplex PCR and SNP genotyping PCR.","output":"Dual priming oligonucleotide system for the multiplex detection of respiratory viruses and SNP genotyping of CYP2C19 gene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates how capital requirements and bank competition affect banks' financial soundness in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

OBJECTIVES: In order to find drugs that treat coronavirus infections, including SARS, we screened traditional medicinal herbal extracts and evaluated their antiviral activities on coronavirus replication. STUDY DESIGN: We employed a plaque assay to evaluate the effect of 22 medicinal herbal extracts on virus replication. We determined the 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of each extract that was necessary to inhibit the replication of mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59); we also determined 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC(50)) for each extract. Northern and Western blot analyzes were performed to investigate antiviral activity in MHV-infected DBT cells, including virus entry, viral RNA and protein expression, and virus release. Coronavirus specific inhibition was also demonstrated using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). RESULTS: Cimicifuga rhizoma, Meliae cortex, Coptidis rhizoma, Phellodendron cortex and Sophora subprostrata radix decreased the MHV production and the intracellular viral RNA and protein expression with EC(50) values ranging from 2.0 to 27.5 g/ml. These extracts also significantly decreased PEDV production and less dramatically decreased vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) production in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The extracts selected strongly inhibited MHV replication and could be potential candidates for new anti-coronavirus drugs.","output":"In vitro inhibition of coronavirus replications by the traditionally used medicinal herbal extracts, Cimicifuga rhizoma, Meliae cortex, Coptidis rhizoma, and Phellodendron cortex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim The aim of this scoping review is to identify the eye tracking paradigms and eye movement measures used to investigate auditory and reading comprehension deficits in persons with aphasia (PWA).

METHODS: Random-effect inverse-variance weighted (IVW) and seven sensitivity analyses were performed. Data for weight traits were collected from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) ranging from 39,620 to 434,794 individuals. Summarized data for testosterone levels were obtained from a GWAS up to 230,454 individuals. RESULTS: Higher adult BMI are significantly associated with lower BT (? = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.16, -0.09) and TT in men (? = -0.25, 95% CI: -0.30, -0.20). On the contrary, higher adult BMI increased the levels of BT (? = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.20) and TT (? = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07) in women.

It is worthwhile to extrapolate from its proven therapeutic effects as there is a high similarity in the structure and genome of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. There are many possible mechanisms through which GZ acts against viruses: increasing nitrous oxide production in macrophages, affecting transcription factors and cellular signalling pathways, directly altering the viral lipid-bilayer membrane, and binding to the ACE2 receptor. In this review, we discuss the possible use of GZ in the COVID-19 setting, where topical administration appears to be promising, with the nasal and oral cavity notably being the potent location in terms of viral load.

However, the softwares predetermined cutoffs are usually set at the medians or quantiles of gene expression values. There are also few clinicopathological features available in pre-processed datasets. We applied an in-house workflow, including data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, sliding-window cutoff selection, KaplanCMeier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard modeling for biomarker discovery. In our approach for the TCGA HNSCC cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes to find optimal cutoff values. After adjustments with confounders, clinical tumor stage and surgical margin involvement were found to be independent risk factors for prognosis. According to the results tables that show hazard ratios with Bonferroni-adjusted p values under the optimal cutoff, three biomarker candidates, CAMK2N1, CALML5, and FCGBP, are significantly associated with overall survival. We validated this discovery by using the another independent HNSCC dataset (GSE65858). Thus, we suggest that transcriptomic analysis could help with biomarker discovery.

The acquired muscle paralysis associated with modern critical care can be of neurogenic or myogenic origin, yet the distinction between these origins is hampered by the precision of current diagnostic methods. This has resulted in the pooling of all acquired muscle paralyses, independent of their origin, into the term Intensive Care Unit Acquired Muscle Weakness (ICUAW). This is unfortunate since the acquired neuropathy (critical illness polyneuropathy, CIP) has a slower recovery than the myopathy (critical illness myopathy, CIM); therapies need to target underlying mechanisms and every patient deserves as accurate a diagnosis as possible. This study aims at evaluating different diagnostic methods in the diagnosis of CIP and CIM in critically ill, immobilized and mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods. ICU patients with acquired quadriplegia in response to critical care were included in the study. A total of 142 patients were examined with routine electrophysiological methods, together with biochemical analyses of myosin:actin (M:A) ratios of muscle biopsies. In addition, comparisons of evoked electromyographic (EMG) responses in direct vs. indirect muscle stimulation and histopathological analyses of muscle biopsies were performed in a subset of the patients. Results. ICU patients with quadriplegia were stratified into five groups based on the hallmark of CIM, i.e., preferential myosin loss (myosin:actin ratio, M:A) and classified as severe (M:A < 0.5; n = 12), moderate (0.5  M:A < 1; n = 40), mildly moderate (1  M:A < 1.5; n = 49), mild (1.5  M:A < 1.7; n = 24) and normal (1.7  M:A; n = 19). Identical M:A ratios were obtained in the small (4C15 mg) muscle samples, using a disposable semiautomatic microbiopsy needle instrument, and the larger (>80 mg) samples, obtained with a conchotome instrument. Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) duration was increased and amplitude decreased in patients with preferential myosin loss, but deviations from this relationship were observed in numerous patients, resulting in only weak correlations between CMAP properties and M:A. Advanced electrophysiological methods measuring refractoriness and comparing CMAP amplitude after indirect nerve vs. direct muscle stimulation are time consuming and did not increase precision compared with conventional electrophysiological measurements in the diagnosis of CIM. Low CMAP amplitude upon indirect vs. direct stimulation strongly suggest a neurogenic lesion, i.e., CIP, but this was rarely observed among the patients in this study. Histopathological diagnosis of CIM/CIP based on enzyme histochemical mATPase stainings were hampered by poor quantitative precision of myosin loss and the impact of pathological findings unrelated to acute quadriplegia. Conclusion. Conventional electrophysiological methods are valuable in identifying the peripheral origin of quadriplegia in ICU patients, but do not reliably separate between neurogenic vs. myogenic origins of paralysis. The hallmark of CIM, preferential myosin loss, can be reliably evaluated in the small samples obtained with the microbiopsy instrument. The major advantage of this method is that it is less invasive than conventional muscle biopsies, reducing the risk of bleeding in ICU patients, who are frequently receiving anticoagulant treatment, and it can be repeated multiple times during follow up for monitoring purposes.","output":"Neurogenic vs. Myogenic Origin of Acquired Muscle Paralysis in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Patients: Evaluation of Different Diagnostic Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recently many serological assays for detection of antibodies to SARS-COV-2 virus were introduced on the market.

Indeed, this new realm of the whole patient-based approach is being taught in osteopathic schools around the country, and the osteopathic principles of a mind-body-spirit-based treatment are being instilled in many new Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) students. However, despite their proven therapeutic value, there are still many individuals, both in and outside the medical profession, who are unaware (or misinformed) of the therapeutic uses and potential benefits of OMT. Here, we provide a brief introduction to this osteopathic therapeutic approach, focusing on the hands-on techniques that are regularly implemented in the clinical setting. It is becoming increasingly evident that different OMTs can be implemented to enhance patient recovery, both alone and in conjunction with the targeted therapies used in allopathic regimens. Therefore, it may be beneficial to inform the general medical community and educate the public and those associated with the healthcare field about the benefits of using OMT as a treatment modality. OMT is lower-cost, noninvasive, and highly effective in promoting full-body healing by targeting the nervous, lymphatic, immune, and vascular systems. There is a growing body of literature related to osteopathic research and the possible molecular pathways involved in the healing process, and this burgeoning field of medicine is expected to increase in value in the healthcare field. This brief review article explains the frequently utilized OMT modalities and their recognized therapeutic benefits, which underscore the need to understand the possible molecular mechanisms and circulating biomarkers linked to the systemic benefits of osteopathic medicine.","output":"Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine: A Brief Review of the Hands-On Treatment Approaches and Their Therapeutic Uses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 situation is a moment that homogenizes everyone's efforts to reduce outdoor activities, so a space of self-actualization is required to trigger creative skills and sportsmanship The most qualified alternative to answer these needs for everyone in the digital age is the E-sport Trying to take advantage of this opportunity, Bubu Gaming, as an Indonesian digital sports games marketer, initiated \\"LiveStream Aid 2020\\" with the theme \\"PlayFromHome, Stay Safe, Donate \\" Tirto id and Kompas com covered the two-day event However, researchers interrogate those two news frames and discover different perspectives Guided by Entman Framing Analysis with the theory of intersectionality, the results obtained indicate the imbalance of identity in those news frames Tirto id viewed from the category of structural intersectionality and built the reader's opinion that the government, through Sandiaga Uno, supports these activities On the other hand, Kompas com put the name of Pevita Pearce without adequate narrative so that it can be categorized as representational intersectionality","output":"Imbalance Identity In E-Sports News Intersectionality On COVID-19 Pandemic Situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a worldwide humanitarian crisis. Old age, comorbid conditions, end-stage organ impairment, and advanced cancer, increase the risk of mortality in serious COVID-19. A subset of serious COVID-19 patients with serious acute respiratory illness may be triaged not to receive aggressive intensive care unit (ICU) treatment and ventilation or may be discontinued from ventilation due to their underlying conditions. Those not eligible for aggressive ICU measures should receive appropriate symptom management. Early warning scores (EWS), oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate, can facilitate categorizing COVID-19 patients as stable, unstable, and end of life. Breathlessness, delirium, respiratory secretions, and pain, are the key symptoms that need to be assessed and palliated. Palliative sedation measures are needed to manage intractable symptoms. Goals of care should be discussed, and advance care plan should be made in patients who are unlikely to benefit from aggressive ICU measures and ventilation. For patients who are already in an ICU, either ventilated or needing ventilation, a futility assessment is made. If there is a consensus on futility, a family meeting is conducted either virtually or face to face depending on the infection risk and infection control protocol. The family should be sensitively communicated about the futility of ICU measures and foregoing life-sustaining treatment. Family meeting outcomes are documented, and consent for foregoing life-sustaining treatment is obtained.

Various drawing tasks are widely used to assess brain function. The neuropsychological basis of drawing is extremely sophisticated. Previous work has addressed the critical role of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in drawing, but the specific functions of the PPC in drawing remain unclear. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological studies found that drawing activates the PPC. Lesion-symptom mapping studies have shown an association between PPC injury and drawing deficits in patients with global and focal cerebral pathology. These findings depicted a core framework of the fronto-parietal network in drawing tasks. Here, we review neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies applying drawing paradigms and discuss the specific functions of the PPC in visuospatial and sensorimotor aspects. Ultimately, we proposed a hypothetical model based on the dorsal stream.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study was carried out at the Psychiatric Service of the General Hospital/University of Perugia (Italy). Patients were recruited from January 2015 until December 2018. The sample consists of patients with dual diagnosis, divided into two subgroups based on gender; descriptive and bivariate statistics were performed (p<0.05). Male and females were compared according to socio-demographic, clinical and psychopathological features, measured by Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) and factor models of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). RESULTS In our sample (n=157), no significant differences in socio-demographic features were found between male (n=108, 68.8%) and female subjects (n=49, 31.2%). Women displayed a higher frequency of involuntary hospitalizations (53.1% vs 32.4%, p=0.022) and a higher score on the general psychopathology scale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (41.868.96 vs 36.5410.38, p=0.041).

While metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is safe and effective in treating severe obesity, the role of MBS in transplant patients continues to evolve. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients in the 2017 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality and Improvement Project (MBSAQIP) database. Propensity and case-control matching, and multivariable logistic regression were performed for 30-day post-operative outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 336 transplant patients were compared with 157,413 patients without transplant. Propensity and case-control matching reveal no significant differences in mortality (p > 0.2). However, case-control matching revealed longer operative time (104 min versus 76 min, p < 0.001), increased length of stay (2 days versus 1 day, p < 0.05), perioperative transfusions (2% versus 0.22%, p = 0.009), and leak rates (2.2% versus 0.55%, p = 0.02) in the transplant cohort. On multivariable regression analysis, prior transplantation was associated with higher rates of overall (OR 1.6, p = 0.007) and bariatric-related morbidity (OR 1.78, p = 0.004), leak (OR 3.47, p = 0.0027), and surgical site infection (OR 3.32, p = 0.004). Prior transplantation did not predict overall (p = 0.55) nor bariatric-related mortality (p = 0.99).

AKI in kidney donor, which increases the risk of delayed graft function (DGF), may not by itself jeopardize the short- and long-term outcome of transplantation. However, some forms of AKI may induce graft rejection, fibrosis, and eventually graft dysfunction. Therefore, various strategies have been proposed to identify conditions at highest risk of AKI-induced DGF, that can be treated by targeting the donor, the recipient, or even the graft itself with the use of perfusion machines. AKI that occurs early post-transplant after a period of initial recovery of graft function may reflect serious and often occult systemic complications that may require prompt intervention to prevent graft loss. AKI that develops long after transplantation is often related to nephrotoxic drug reactions. In symptomatic patients, AKI is usually associated with various systemic medical complications and could represent a risk of mortality. Electronic systems have been developed to alert transplant physicians that AKI has occurred in a transplant recipient during long-term outpatient follow-up. Herein, we will review most recent understandings of pathophysiology, diagnosis, therapeutic approach, and short- and long-term consequences of AKI occurring in both the donor and in the kidney transplant recipient.","output":"Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) before and after Kidney Transplantation: Causes, Medical Approach, and Implications for the Long-Term Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The scarcity of facemasks, particularly N95 respirators, combined with the lack of solid data to address the suitability of each mask type for adequate health care worker (HCW) protection have caused turmoil among HCWs.

Although various factors such as sociodemographics can affect vaccine hesitancy, the research results differ and it is unclear whether these differences depend on the subjects or the situation, such as the type of infection or vaccine. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between seasonal influenza vaccination behavior and sociodemographic factors under the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between individual factors of risk preference and seasonal influenza vaccination on the premise that there is a difference in the association between efficacy and the risk of side effects of the two vaccines. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on workers aged from 20-65 years on December 22-25, 2020, using data from an Internet survey. We set the presence or absence of 2020/2021 seasonal influenza vaccination as the dependent variable, and each aspect of sociodemographic factors and risk preference as independent variables. We performed a multilevel logistic regression analysis nested by residence. Results: In total, 26,637 respondents (13,600 men, 13,037 women) participated. Significantly more women than men were vaccinated. Both men and women had higher vaccination rates if married, highly educated, with high income, and with underlying disease. Men aged 60-65 had a significantly higher vaccination rate than those aged 20-29, while women aged 40-49 and 50-59 had a significantly lower rate than those aged 20-29. These results differed from those of a previous study on the vaccination intentions of the same subjects for COVID-19. Those with low risk preference had higher vaccination rates than those with high risk preference.

There have been studies of patients on in-center hemodialysis, but home dialysis population data are scarce. Our objective is to study the incidence and course of COVID-19 in a home dialysis unit (HDU) at the height of the pandemic. METHODS: An observational, retrospective study enrolling all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the HDU of Hospital Universitario La Paz (La Paz University Hospital) (Madrid, Spain) between March 10 and May 15, 2020. We collected clinical data from the HDU (57 patients on peritoneal dialysis and 22 patients on home hemodialysis) and compared the clinical characteristics and course of patients with and without COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Twelve patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (9 peritoneal dialysis; 3 home hemodialysis). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of clinical characteristics between patients with COVID-19 and the rest of the unit. The mean age was 6218.5 years; most were men (75%). All patients but one required hospitalization. Ten patients (83%) were discharged following a mean of 16.49.7 days of hospitalization. Two patients were diagnosed while hospitalized for other conditions, and these were the only patients who died. Those who died were older than those who survived. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 in our HDU in Madrid at the height of the pandemic was high, especially in patients on peritoneal dialysis. No potential benefit for preventing the infection in patients on home dialysis was observed. Advanced age and nosocomial transmission were the main factors linked to a worse prognosis.","output":"COVID-19 incidence and outcomes in a home dialysis unit in Madrid (Spain) at the height of the pandemic./ Incidencia y resultados de la COVID-19 en una unidad de dilisis domiciliaria en Madrid (Espa?a) durante el pico de la pandemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we investigated the effects of an ultrasonically activated stream (UAS) on the removal of microbial contaminants from spinach leaves. The microbial loads on samples cleaned with and without UAS were enumerated using the cell culture method and compared against unwashed samples on day 0 and day 6 after cleaning. The effects of UAS cleaning on leaf quality were also examined through both macroscopic and microscopic inspection, as well as measurement of the electrolyte leakage rate. Results showed that the microbial load on samples cleaned with UAS for 2 min was significantly lower on day 6 after cleaning than on those treated without ultrasound. Comparison between the cleaning effects of UAS for 40 s versus 2 min indicated that a cleaning duration of 2 min allowed sufficient time for UAS to disaggregate and detach the microbial contamination more effectively. In this case, the induction of bacteria into a viable but non-culturable state does not affect the shelf-life test results as much as it does with a 40 s clean. UAS cleaning for 2 min did not produce significant surface damage, which can affect overall leaf quality.

Despite efforts to maintain health services, disruptions of varying magnitude and duration were found in every country, with no clear patterns by country income group or pandemic intensity. Disruptions in health services often preceded COVID-19 waves. Cancer screenings, TB screening and detection and HIV testing were most affected (26-96% declines). Total outpatient visits declined by 9-40% at national levels and remained lower than predicted by the end of 2020. Maternal health services were disrupted in approximately half of the countries, with declines ranging from 5% to 33%. Child vaccinations were disrupted for shorter periods, but we estimate that catch-up campaigns might not have reached all children missed. By contrast, provision of antiretrovirals for HIV was not affected. By the end of 2020, substantial disruptions remained in half of the countries. Preliminary data for 2021 indicate that disruptions likely persisted.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, general practitioners (GPs) in the Czech Republic, as in other countries, had to rapidly switch to telemedicine visits. Information on patient perspectives about these visits is lacking. Our study aims to understand patients' perceptions about telemedicine visits at GPs during COVID-19, and to identify barriers and benefits of telemedicine in primary care. METHODS: A qualitative approach was applied. 40 semi-structured interviews were conducted (25 with patients who had telemedicine visits with a GP, and 15 with representatives of patients' organisations). Data was analysed using a thematic analysis. RESULTS: It has been shown that telemedicine visits took place mainly through telephone and email communication, without using the full potential of telemedicine. The absence of legal regulation and guidelines for telemedicine and the implementation of telemedicine in primary care without prior adaptation generates a number of problems in the patient-physician relationship. In some cases, the unregulated use of telemedicine leads to inequalities in access to healthcare. Persistent medical paternalism has also been shown to significantly affect telemedicine visits in primary care.

It is important to ensure that the treatments which are provided are both clinically effective and economically justifiable. Based on recent new evidence, routine oxygen therapy is no longer recommended in MI patients without hypoxemia. By using data from a nationwide randomized clinical trial, we estimated oxygen therapy related cost savings in this important clinical setting. Methods: The DETermination of the role of Oxygen in suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction (DETO2X-AMI) trial randomized 6,629 patients from 35 hospitals across Sweden to oxygen at 6 L/min for 6C12 h or ambient air. Costs for drug and medical supplies, and labor were calculated per patient, for the whole study population, and for the total annual care episodes for MI in Sweden (N = 16,100) with 10 million inhabitants. Results: Per patient, costs were estimated to 36 USD, summing up to a total cost of 119,832 USD for the whole study population allocated to oxygen treatment. Applied to the annual care episodes for MI in Sweden, costs sum up to between 514,060 and 604,777 USD. In the trial, 62 (2%) patients assigned to oxygen and 254 (8%) patients assigned to ambient air developed hypoxemia. A threshold analysis suggested that up to a cut-off of 624 USD spent for hypoxemia treatment related costs per patient, avoiding routine oxygen therapy remains cost saving.

Among the different vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2, Covishield was the first vaccine approved for emergency use in Nepal. We report two cases of Superficial Vein Thrombosis (SVT) for the first time in the literature after vaccination with the Chimpanzee Adenovirus-vectored Vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine). CASES PRESENTATION: Two cases, a 24-year-old young Chhetri male and a 62-year-old Chhetri female who have received Covishield (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine, developed pain in left calf after 2 weeks and 10 weeks of vaccination, respectively. Both the case belongs to the Chhetri ethnic group of Nepal. The pain became severe on the fourth week of immunization in the first case while the pain was acute and severe on the 10(th) week of vaccination in the second case. The first presented to emergency room and second case was referred to the emergency room from Orthopedic Clinic. On evaluation the first patient had normal vitals with no history of fever and swelling yet displayed non-radiating mild to moderate intensity pain localized to left leg below the knee which became aggravated by movements. In the second case however pain was more intense with other characteristics as first case. Both cases had low wells score (< 4). On local examination tenderness was noted on squeezing but other systemic examination findings of the patient were within normal limits in both cases. Among the numerous vaccines used to fight the battle against COVID-19 disease, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, Covishield, has been widely used in Nepal and India. Apart from other minor side effects, in few cases thromboses have been reported after vaccination of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Covishield, vaccine. CONCLUSION: These cases reporting Superficial Vein Thrombosis may be an additional adverse effect to the list of adverse events associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, Covishield, vaccine. However, the benefits of the vaccine in breaking the chain of COVID 19 spread are certainly greater than the risk of thromboses.","output":"Superficial venous thrombosisas a possible consequence of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine: two case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: CXCR (CXC Chemokine Receptor) is a complex of the immune-associated protein involved in tumor activation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis through various chemical signals in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, significant prognostic characteristics of CXCR members and their impact on the occurrence and progression of glioma have not yet been fully elucidated. Methods: In this research, we used Oncomine, TCGA, GTEx, and CGGA databases to analyze the transcription and survival data of glioma patients. Afterward, the influence of CXCR members on the TME was explored using comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Results: The mRNA expression levels of CXCR1/2/3/4/7 were significantly up-regulated in glioma than in normal samples, whereas the mRNA expression level of CXCR5 was decreased. We then summarized the genetic alteration landscape of CXCR and identified two molecular subtypes based on CXCR expression patterns in glioma. The characteristics of CXCRs were also investigated, including the clinicopathological parameters, TME cell infiltration, and prognosis of patients with glioma. After Lasso and multivariable Cox regression, a CR-Score for predicting overall survival (OS) was constructed and the predictive performance of the signature was validated. The high-risk group was a significantly poorer prognostic group than the low-risk group as judged by the CR-Score (TCGA cohort, p < 0.001, CGGA cohort, p < 0.001). Moreover, the CR-Score was significantly correlated to the tumor-immune infiltration and cancer stem cell (CSC) index. A risk scale-based nomogram incorporating clinical factors for individual risk estimation was established thereby. Conclusion: These findings may pave the way for enhancing our understanding of CXCR modification patterns and developing better immune therapeutic approaches for glioma.","output":"Prognostic Value and Therapeutic Perspectives of CXCR Members in the Glioma Microenvironment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has been associated with reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and mild disease with rapid waning, even after a third dose, nevertheless omicron has also been associated with milder disease than previous variants. With previous variants protection against severe disease has been substantially higher than protection against infection. MethodsWe used a test-negative case-control design to estimate VE against hospitalisation with the omicron and delta variants using community and in hospital testing linked to hospital records. As a milder disease, there may be an increasing proportion of hospitalised individuals with Omicron as an incidental finding. We therefore investigated the impact of using more specific and more severe hospitalisation indicators on VE. ResultsAmong 18-64 year olds using all Covid-19 cases admitted via emergency care VE after a booster peaked at 82.4% and dropped to 53.6% by 15+ weeks after the booster; using all admissions for >= 2 days stay with a respiratory code in the primary diagnostic field VE ranged from 90.9% down to 67.4%; further restricting to those on oxygen/ventilated/on intensive care VE ranged from 97.1% down to 75.9%. Among 65+ year olds the equivalent VE estimates were 92.4% down to 76.9%; 91.3% down to 85.3% and 95.8% down to 86.8%. ConclusionsWith generally milder disease seen with Omicron, in particular in younger adults, contamination of hospitalisations with incidental cases is likely to reduce VE estimates against hospitalisation. VE estimates improve and waning and waning is more limited when definitions of hospitalisation that are more specific to severe respiratory disease are used.","output":"Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron and Delta hospitalisation: test negative case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a history of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) increases risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study, we retrieved individual data from in-patients treated March 1 to April 15, 2020 from COVID-19 registries of three hospitals in Saxony, Germany. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA recommendations using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases and bibliographies of identified papers (last search on April 11, 2020) and pooled data with those deriving from our multicenter study. Of 3762 records identified, 11 eligible observational studies of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in quantitative data synthesis. Risk ratios (RR) of severe COVID-19 according to history of CVD were pooled using DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and I2-statistics. Severity of COVID-19 according to definitions applied in included studies was the main outcome. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for clusters of studies with equal definitions of severity. RESULTS: Pooled analysis included data from 1906 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (43.9% females, median age ranging from 39 to 76 years). Patients with previous CVD had higher risk of severe COVID-19 than those without [RR 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52-2.81; p < 0.0001]. This association was also observed in clusters of studies that defined severe manifestation of the disease by clinical parameters (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.22-1.71; p < 0.0001), necessity of intensive care (RR 2.79, 95% CI 1.83-4.24; p < 0.0001) and in-hospital death (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.75-2.7; p < 0.0001).

During the pandemic caused by COVID-19 and the lockdown established, people have reduced considerably their mobility and motor activity, which has led to an increase in unhealthy lifestyle habits, raising the risk of suffering from diseases. This paper consists of reviewing the existing scientific literature on recommendations of physical activity during the pandemic and to establish specific guidelines according to the type of population to which the activity would be directed. A search strategy has been carried out in the different databases: Embase, PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science (WoS), including all the articles published until 14 May 2020, to find essays with recommendations on aerobic activity, muscle strengthening, flexibility-stretching, meditation-relaxation, and balance exercises. The articles found have been evaluated considering the following criteria: type of publication, proposals for physical exercise, language, and, if it appears, volume of activity, frequency, intensity, and rest. The results obtained 29 articles that discuss patterns of physical activity, although there is no common consensus on such recommendations during confinement, nor are they suitable for all people. From these results, we can conclude that physical activity is widely recommended during the confinement caused by COVID-19, mainly through the performance of aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance exercises.","output":"Physical Activity Recommendations during COVID-19: Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological diseases diagnosed in almost 70% of patients with chronic pelvic pain (CPP). However, a quarter of women with pelvic pain is diagnosed with external genital endometriosis (EGE) during laparoscopy. A special group is represented by patients with PP that did not stop after the removal of endometrial foci. The mechanisms of the pathogenesis of the formation of pain syndrome are not completely explored yet. According to several authors, a significant role in the pathogenesis of pelvic pain recurrence after surgical treatment of EGE is played by active neuroangiogenesis, both in ectopic and eutopic endometrium. The aim of the study was to expand the understanding of the pathogenesis of pelvic pain that did not stop (recurrence) after surgical treatment of external genital endometriosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 2 stages. At the first stage (algological), data from B&B, NRS and VRS algological questionnaires, which were completed by patients with recurrent PP after surgical treatment of EGE, were analyzed (n = 130, aged 18-45 years old, average age 32.5  7.6 years). All women were operated on for EGE no later than 3-6 months after assessing the patients by the algological questionnaires; they did not receive drug therapy after surgical treatment and sought medical attention for recurrent pelvic pain. Materials for the study of the endometrium were obtained by the pipelle biopsymethod. The control group was formed from a number of women with EGE without PP, who applied for surgical treatment of infertility (n = 30). RESULTS: The results of the study have shown that the basis of pathogenesis of pelvic pain recurrence in patients who did not receive medical therapy after surgical treatment of EGE is the activation of neuro-angiogenesis processes and reduction of apoptosis. The results show a statistically significant 1.6 times increasing expression of NGF in eutopic endometrium (57.9  2.5 vs 35.3  2.1% of patients with the silent form of the gene and its receptor NTRK1 1.8 times (2.78  0.25 versus 1.56  0.21.e. respectively).

An evidence-based decision is important to ensure that patients are receiving the best treatment proven to reduce healing time and improve outcomes, including economic benefits and patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Due to recent restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including closure of wound care centres within hospitals and a drop in patient volume, chronic wound management needs simple-to-use dressings which are still effective and evidence-based solutions. This systematic review was conducted to identify the clinical evidence available on a sucrose octasulfate dressing (TLC-NOSF, UrgoStart dressing range, Laboratoires Urgo, France) to explore its efficacy in the management of chronic wounds, particularly lower limb ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers. METHOD: A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar was conducted based on the PICO model (patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes) to retrieve publications of different levels of evidence in order to evaluate outcomes of the use of TLC-NOSF dressings. RESULTS: A total of 21 publications of different levels, ranging from double-blind randomised control trials to case reports, involving over 12,000 patients, were identified through PubMed, with a further eight publications through Google Scholar and two publications through Cochrane Library. A total of seven results were omitted due to the lack of relevance or repetition.

Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates, which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.","output":"Rapidly evaluating lockdown strategies using spectral analysis: the cycles behind new daily COVID-19 cases and what happens after lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objectives. The risk of developing invasive cancer increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in Romania, where the incidence of this disease is high due to limited medical education and broad screening. This studys objective is to analyze the number of patients admitted with different types of cervical dysplasia and the treatment applied for the lesions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic compared to the same period for the year before the pandemic. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study that took place in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics I/II (OG I/II) of the Emergency County Hospital of Craiova during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (SP) (15.03.2020C14.03.2021) and in the 12 months before (non-pandemic period) (NPP) (15.03.2019C14.03.2020). The study includes 396 patients with pathological PAP smear results. All the patients included in this study were clinically examined and with colposcopy. The patients with Low-Grade Dysplasia were managed in a conservatory manner and reevaluated after six months. The patients with High-Grade Dysplasia were admitted for an excisional biopsy of the lesion. The excised fragments were sent to the Pathological Anatomy Laboratory for a histopathological examination. Results: This study reveals a decrease of more than half in the number of patients admitted with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions during the pandemic compared to the same period of the year before. The number of biopsies and excisional procedures has been decreasing by more than a factor of three during the pandemic period compared to the year before. Conclusion: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we found that the patients admission rate, diagnosis, and treatment was almost four times lower. As hospital restrictions were not dictated for cancer/precancer management during SP, we may assume that the differences were due to the fear of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to hospitalization. In the context of poor screening performance and high cervical cancer incidence, the influence of the SP may result in a further increase of severe cases related to this condition.","output":"The Influence of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cervical Dysplasia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The publication explores the features of the digital technologies' usage to organize the work of the Young Scientists' Councils and describes the best practices.

Logistic regression model results showed that non-Hispanic Blacks (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.24-0.44) and Hispanics (AOR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.77) were less willing to get a vaccine than non-Hispanic Whites; beneficiaries with an income of less than $25 000 (AOR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62-0.81) were less willing to get the vaccine than those with an income of $25 000 or more; those who did not think that the COVID-19 virus was more contagious (AOR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41-0.69) or more deadly (AOR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41-0.65) were also less willing to get the vaccine than those who thought that the virus was more contagious or more deadly than the influenza virus. CONCLUSIONS The 2020 MCBS survey data showed that close to 40% of Medicare beneficiaries were hesitant about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, and the hesitancy was greater in racial/ethnic minorities. Medicare beneficiaries were concerned about the safety of the vaccine, and some appeared to be misinformed. Evidence-based educational and policy-level interventions need to be implemented to further promote COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"Willingness to Get a COVID-19 Vaccine and Reasons for Hesitancy Among Medicare Beneficiaries: Results From a National Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is one of the most potential targets in cancer therapy. We have demonstrated using a combination of molecular docking and fast pulling of ligand (FPL) simulations that marine fungi derivatives can be possible inhibitors, preventing the biological activity of Hsp90. The computational approaches were validated and compared with previous experiments. Based on the benchmark of available inhibitors of Hsp90, the GOLD docking package using the ChemPLP scoring function was found to be superior over both Autodock Vina and Autodock4 in the preliminary estimation of the ligand-binding affinity and binding pose with the Pearson correlation, R = -0.62. Moreover, FPL calculations were also indicated as a suitable approach to refine docking simulations with a correlation coefficient with the experimental data of R = -0.81. Therefore, the binding affinity of marine fungi derivatives to Hsp90 was evaluated. Docking and FPL calculations suggest that five compounds including 23, 40, 46, 48, and 52 are highly potent inhibitors for Hsp90. The obtained results enhance cancer therapy research.","output":"Molecular design of anticancer drugs from marine fungi derivatives."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of a definitive therapy during this ongoing unprecedented crisis, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) has shown some promising results. This review summarizes the existing evidence of the efficacy of CPT in COVID-19 patients based upon scientific publications to date. We have included only the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through an extensive screening of electronic databases up to July 31, 2021. In 19 RCTs, with a total of 16,476 COVID-19 patients we found low-quality evidence of significant reduction in mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66C0.96, I(2) = 40%), better clinical outcome when applied <7 days (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.28C3.53, I(2) = 0%), and improved viral clearance (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3C5.45, I(2) = 74%). Meta-regression analysis found that as a covariate, intubation on admission (p = 0.007) had a significant impact. However, there was any significant reduction neither in duration for clinical improvement (MD = ?0.79, 95% CI: ?2.76C1.18, I(2) = 98%), nor in total period of hospital stay (MD = 0.02, 95% CI: ?0.75C0.78, I(2) = 81%).

The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes the 2-O-methyltransferase nsp16, which, when bound to the coactivator nsp10, uses S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a donor to transfer a methyl group to the first ribonucleotide of the mRNA in the final step of viral mRNA capping. Here, we provide biochemical and structural evidence that this reaction requires divalent cations, preferably Mn(2+), and a coronavirus-specific four-residue insert. We determined the x-ray structures of the SARS-CoV-2 2-O-methyltransferase (the nsp16-nsp10 heterodimer) in complex with its reaction substrates, products, and divalent metal cations. These structural snapshots revealed that metal ions and the insert stabilize interactions between the capped RNA and nsp16, resulting in the precise alignment of the ribonucleotides in the active site. Comparison of available structures of 2-O-methyltransferases with capped RNAs from different organisms revealed that the four-residue insert unique to coronavirus nsp16 alters the backbone conformation of the capped RNA in the binding groove, thereby promoting catalysis. This insert is highly conserved across coronaviruses, and its absence in mammalian methyltransferases makes this region a promising site for structure-guided drug design of selective coronavirus inhibitors.","output":"Mn(2+) coordinates Cap-0-RNA to align substrates for efficient 2-O-methyl transfer by SARS-CoV-2 nsp16"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic is still spreading globally. Contact tracing is a vital strategy in epidemic emergency management; however, traditional contact tracing faces many limitations in practice. The application of digital technology provides an opportunity for local governments to trace the contacts of individuals with COVID-19 more comprehensively, efficiently, and precisely. OBJECTIVE: Our research aimed to provide new solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional contact tracing by introducing the organizational process, technical process, and main achievements of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province. METHODS: A graph database algorithm, which can efficiently process complex relational networks, was applied in Hainan Province; this algorithm relies on a governmental big data platform to analyze multisource COVID-19 epidemic data and build networks of relationships among high-risk infected individuals, the general population, vehicles, and public places to identify and trace contacts. We summarized the organizational and technical process of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province based on interviews and data analyses. RESULTS: An integrated emergency management command system and a multi-agency coordination mechanism were formed during the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hainan Province. The collection, storage, analysis, and application of multisource epidemic data were realized based on the government's big data platform using a centralized model. The graph database algorithm is compatible with this platform and can analyze multisource and heterogeneous big data related to the epidemic. These practices were used to quickly and accurately identify and trace 10,871 contacts among hundreds of thousands of epidemic data records; 378 closest contacts and a number of public places with high risk of infection were identified. A confirmed patient was found after quarantine measures were implemented by all contacts. CONCLUSIONS: During the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic, Hainan Province used a graph database algorithm to trace contacts in a centralized model, which can identify infected individuals and high-risk public places more quickly and accurately. This practice can provide support to government agencies to implement precise, agile, and evidence-based emergency management measures and improve the responsiveness of the public health emergency response system. Strengthening data security, improving tracing accuracy, enabling intelligent data collection, and improving data-sharing mechanisms and technologies are directions for optimizing digital contact tracing.","output":"Digital Contact Tracing Based on a Graph Database Algorithm for Emergency Management During the COVID-19 Epidemic: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 first occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019 Subsequently, the virus spread throughout the world and as of June 2020 the total number of confirmed cases are above 4 7 million with over 315,000 deaths Machine learning algorithms built on radiography images can be used as a decision support mechanism to aid radiologists to speed up the diagnostic process The aim of this work is to conduct a critical analysis to investigate the applicability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the purpose of COVID-19 detection in chest X-ray images and highlight the issues of using CNN directly on the whole image To accomplish this task, we use 12-off-the-shelf CNN architectures in transfer learning mode on 3 publicly available chest X-ray databases together with proposing a shallow CNN architecture in which we train it from scratch Chest X-ray images are fed into CNN models without any preprocessing to replicate researches used chest X-rays in this manner Then a qualitative investigation performed to inspect the decisions made by CNNs using a technique known as class activation maps (CAM) Using CAMs, one can map the activations contributed to the decision of CNNs back to the original image to visualize the most discriminating region(s) on the input image We conclude that CNN decisions should not be taken into consideration, despite their high classification accuracy, until clinicians can visually inspect and approve the region(s) of the input image used by CNNs that lead to its prediction","output":"Issues associated with deploying CNN transfer learning to detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Emergency medical services (EMS) responders are a group of medically skilled professionals who perform a wide range of essential medical services within a community including emergency response, patient transport, and mobile integrated healthcare. The proper functioning of the EMS system is paramount to the well-being of the medical system and public health. The intent of this paper is to review current EMS standards and practice to determine the danger a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) may pose to these healthcare workers and the community. Areas Addressed: Through the review of EMS practice several areas were identified as vulnerabilities to the EMS network. These vulnerabilities consisted of the lack of standardized licensing practice, inconsistent medical direction, and the inability to properly implement the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The compounding of these vulnerabilities allows for HCIDs to pose a serious threat to EMS personnel with the possibility of devastating and crippling the EMS infrastructure within the US. Discussion: The vulnerabilities identified must be addressed both to protect EMS providers and to enhance the resilience of the US healthcare system. Ways to address the identified vulnerabilities should focus on improving the EMS curriculum and increasing minimum levels of education for first responders. Targeting minimum education and training standards could be the most effect method of reducing the dangers of HCIDs to EMS systems.","output":"Review of Emergency Medical Services Vulnerability to High Consequence Infectious Disease in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many countries into lockdown and has led to the postponement of nonurgent neurosurgical procedures. Although stress has been investigated during this pandemic, there are no reports on anxiety in neurosurgical patients undergoing nonurgent surgical procedures. METHODS Neurosurgical patients admitted to hospitals in eastern Lombardy for nonurgent surgery after the lockdown prospectively completed a pre- and postoperative structured questionnaire. Recorded data included demographics, pathology, time on surgical waiting list, anxiety related to COVID-19, primary pathology and surgery, safety perception during hospital admission before and after surgery, and surgical outcomes. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Descriptive statistics were computed on the different variables and data were stratified according to pathology (oncological vs nononcological). Three different models were used to investigate which variables had the greatest impact on anxiety, oncological patients, and safety perception, respectively. Because the variables (Xs) were of a different nature (qualitative and quantitative), mostly asymmetrical, and related to outcome (Y) by nonlinear relationships, a machine learning approach composed of three steps (1, random forest growing; 2, relative variable importance measure; and 3, partial dependence plots) was chosen. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three patients from 10 different hospitals were included in the study. None of the patients developed COVID-19 after surgery. State and trait anxiety were reported by 30.3% and 18.9% of patients, respectively. Higher values of state anxiety were documented in oncological compared to nononcological patients (46.7% vs 25%; p = 0.055). Anxiety was strongly associated with worry about primary pathology, surgery, disease worsening, and with stress during waiting time, as expected. Worry about positivity to SARS-CoV-2, however, was the strongest factor associated with anxiety, even though none of the patients were infected. Neuro-oncological disease was associated with state anxiety and with worry about surgery and COVID-19. Increased bed distance and availability of hand sanitizer were associated with a feeling of safety. CONCLUSIONS These data underline the importance of psychological support, especially for neuro-oncological patients, during a pandemic.","output":"Anxiety in neurosurgical patients undergoing nonurgent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first emerging infectious disease of the 21st century that has been highly transmissible and fatal and was caused by a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS\\\\CoV).

Existing in non\\\\identified animal reservoirs, SARS\\\\CoV continues to represent a threat to humans although more than four years have passed since a large outbreak of SARS, and no new cases have been reported. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of reemergence of SARS. It is hence necessary to understand the biology of the SARS\\\\CoV to deal adequately with the next outbreak, whenever it happens. The SARS\\\\CoV is a novel coronavirus with a large (30 thousand nucleotides) positive\\\\sense, single\\\\stranded RNA containing 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) of which 2 large ORFs constitute the replicase gene which encodes proteins required for viral RNA syntheses. The remaining 12 ORFs encode the 4 structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope; and eight accessory proteins. The viral genome and its expression within the host cell undergoes extensive translational and enzymatic processing to form the 4 structural, 8 accessory and 16 nonstructural proteins. In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms or capsid assembly and viral pathogenesis, laboratories around the world have adopted a variety of approaches to answering these trivial questions.

Secondly, due to the difference of the sensitivity of abnormal information shock, the jump behavior of bank stock price is heterogeneous. Moreover, CJ-GARCH models are suitable for most banks, while ARJI-R2-GARCH models are more suitable for small and medium sized banks.

METHODS: All patients who had abdominal tuberculosis and were treated at Al-Ain Hospital between January 2011 and December 2018 were studied. Data were collected retrospectively using a structured protocol including demography, clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, management, and outcome. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients having a median age of 30 years were studied with an incidence of 0.6/100,000 population. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (95.8%) and malaise (79.2%). Fever was present only in nine patients (37.5%). Laboratory investigations, except for polymerase chain reaction immunoassay, were not helpful. Chest X-ray was abnormal in three patients (12.5%).

This study aimed to assess epidemiological and intergenerational clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with cluster outbreaks to provide valuable data for the prevention and control of COVID-19. METHODS: We identified the first employee with COVID-19 at a supermarket and screened the close contacts of this index patient. Confirmed cases were divided into two groups according to the generation (first generation comprising supermarket employees [group A] and second or third generations comprising family members or friends of the supermarket employees [group B]). The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the two groups were retrospectively compared. RESULTS: A total of 8437 people were screened, and 24 COVID-19 patients were identified. Seven patients (29.2%) were asymptomatic; three patients were responsible for six symptomatic cases. The interval from the confirmation of the first case to symptom onset in symptomatic patients was 5-11 days. The clinical manifestations of symptomatic patients upon admission were non-specific. All patients (including the seven asymptomatic patients) were admitted based on chest computed tomography features indicative of pneumonia. There were 11 cases in group A (first generation) and 13 cases in group B (second generation, 11 cases; third generation, 2 cases), with no significant differences in clinical and epidemiological characteristics between the two groups, except for sex, duration from symptom onset to hospitalization, and underlying disease (P > 0.05).

The search was limited to peer-reviewed literature published in English. Eligible studies examined the association between at least one correlate/factor and anxiety disorders or symptoms in aged care residents aged 50+ years. RESULTS A total of 3741 articles were identified, of which 34 studies (with a total of 1 543 554 participants) were included in this review. Correlates associated with anxiety included pain, use of anti-depressants/lithium, depression, and lower perceived quality of life.

The planned sample size was 60 Spatients to detect the increase of 2.0 ml/kg/min change in VO2peak with a standard deviation of 2.6 ml/kg/min, one-sided significance level of 2.5% and 80% power. The exercise group underwent home-based HIIT using a smartphone and a Fitbit Versa thrice weekly for 12 weeks (three times per week). The primary outcome was the 12-week change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak;mL/kg/min) between the groups. Other outcomes included muscle strength, 6-min walk test, resting heart rate, physical activity, fatigue, safety, and quality of life. Results: Of the 50 participants, 44 (exercise group, n=23;control group, n=21) completed the CRF assessment and 6 did not because of issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The change in VO2peak increased significantly in the exercise group (0.9 [95%CI, 0.1 to 1.7]) compared with the control group (-0.8 [95%CI,-1.5 to-0.1]) (mean difference, 1.7 [95% CI, 0.7 to 2.7], p <.01). Leg strength also increased significantly in the exercise group compared with the control group (mean difference, 13.5 [95% CI, 2.9 to 24.1], p <.01). Changes in other outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: A home-based HIIT intervention can lead to improved cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength in early-stage breast cancer survivors;however, a multicenter pragmatic clinical trial is required to confirm the benefits of the habit-B program.","output":"Effect of home-based smartphone-supported high-intensity interval training on cardiorespiratory fitness in breast cancer survivors: A randomized controlled trial of the habit-B program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Edema, i.e., fluid accumulation in the interstitial space, accompanies numerous pathological states of the human organism, including heart failure (HF), inflammatory response, and lymphedema. Nevertheless, techniques for quantitative assessment of the edemas severity and dynamics are absent in clinical practice, and the analysis is mainly limited to physical examination. This fact stimulates the development of novel methods for fast and reliable diagnostics of fluid retention in tissues. In this work, we focused on the possibilities of two microscopic techniques, nailfold video capillaroscopy (NVC) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), in the assessment of the short-term and long-term cutaneous edema. We showed that for the patients with HF, morphological parameters obtained by NVCnamely, the apical diameter of capillaries and the size of the perivascular zoneindicate long-term edema. On the other hand, for healthy volunteers, the application of two models of short-term edema, venous occlusion, and histamine treatment of the skin, did not reveal notable changes in the capillary parameters. However, a significant reduction of the NVC image sharpness was observed in this case, which was suggested to be due to water accumulation in the epidermis. To verify these findings, we made use of CLSM, which provides the skin structure with cellular resolution. It was observed that for the histamine-treated skin, the areas of the dermal papillae become hyporefractive, leading to the loss of contrast and the lower visibility of capillaries. Similar effect was observed for patients undergoing infusion therapy. Collectively, our results reveal the parameters can be used for pericapillary edema assessment using the NVC and CLSM, and paves the way for their application in a clinical set-up.","output":"Pericapillary Edema Assessment by Means of the Nailfold Capillaroscopy and Laser Scanning Microscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The introduction of vaccines has inspired new hope in the battle against SARS-CoV-2.

STUDY DESIGN The 2017 Trauma Quality Improvement Program database was queried and divided into two equal sized sets at random (derivation and validation sets). Multiple logistic regression models were created to determine the risk of mortality using age, sex, mechanism, and trauma activation criterion. The PIMS was derived using the weighted average of each independent predictor. The discriminative power of the scoring tool was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. The PIMS ability to predict mortality was then assessed by using the validation cohort. The score was compared to the Revised Trauma Score (RTS) using the AUROC curve, including a subgroup of patients with normal vital signs. RESULTS The derivation and validation groups each consisted of 163 694 patients. Seven independent predictors of mortality were identified, and the PIMS was derived with scores ranging from 0 to 20. The mortality rate increased from 1.4% to 43.9% and then 100% at scores of 1, 10, and 19, respectively. The model had very good discrimination with an AUROC of .79 in both the derivation and validation groups. When compared to the RTS, the AUROC were similar (.79 vs. .78). On subgroup analysis of patients with normal prehospital vital signs, the PIMS was superior to the RTS (.73 vs. .56).

In total, we identified 23 studies, comprising 3,561 participants who were all female. Comparison groups extracted from the studies were a non-clinical group, bulimia nervosa (BN) diagnosis group, and another psychological diagnostic group. RESULTS When AN maladaptive perfectionism levels were compared against the comparison groups, the results showed that those diagnosed with AN were more perfectionistic compared to the non-clinical group (g = 1.00), and the other psychiatric diagnosis group (g = 0.41).

In this chapter, we will discuss new information on the impacts of virus-mediated manipulation of Dynein motor complexes and associated machineries and factors. We will highlight how these host cell components impact on pathogenicity and immune responses, as many of the virus-mediated hijacked components also play pivotal roles in immune responses to pathogen insult.

To overcome such challenges, academics must move beyond their traditional functions of research and teaching and engage in entrepreneurial activities. Through engagement in entrepreneurial activities, academics can contribute to frugal innovation (FI) in private HEI (PHEI). The literature in this context emphasizes that academic entrepreneurial engagement (AEE) will lead to innovation, the identification of opportunities for new business ventures, financial rewards for institutions and academics, an impact on the economy, and the enhancement of social welfare. This study presents a systematic review of the literature and adopts the Transfield five-phase strategy to review the literature on AEE from the past two decades (2000C2020). A total of 1,067 papers on FI are obtained, only five of which focus on AEE. Moreover, papers related to AEE for FI are few.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the context of practice and the option of returning home for cervical ripening may now assume greater significance. This work aimed to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed practice around IOL in the UK. METHOD: We used an online questionnaire to survey senior obstetricians and midwives at all 156 UK NHS Trusts and Boards that currently offer maternity services. Responses were analysed to produce descriptive statistics, with free text responses analysed using a conventional content analysis approach. FINDINGS: Responses were received from 92 of 156 UK Trusts and Boards, a 59% response rate. Many Trusts and Boards reported no change to their IOL practice, however 23% reported change in methods used for cervical ripening; 28% a change in criteria for home cervical ripening; 28% stated that more women were returning home during cervical ripening; and 24% noted changes to womens response to recommendations for IOL. Much of the change was reported as happening in response to attempts to minimise hospital attendance and restrictions on birth partners accompanying women. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has changed practice around induction of labour, although this varied significantly between NHS Trusts and Boards.

We sought to elucidate contamination of different surface types and how contamination changes over time. METHODS: We sampled surfaces longitudinally within COVID-19 patient rooms, performed quantitative RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and modeled distance, time, and severity of illness on the probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 using a mixed-effects binomial model. RESULTS: The probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a patient room did not vary with distance. However, we found that surface type predicted probability of detection, with floors and high-touch surfaces having the highest probability of detection: floors (odds ratio [OR], 67.8; 95% credible interval [CrI], 36.3C131) and high-touch elevated surfaces (OR, 7.39; 95% CrI, 4.31C13.1). Increased surface contamination was observed in room where patients required high-flow oxygen, positive airway pressure, or mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.6; 95% CrI, 1.03C2.53). The probability of elevated surface contamination decayed with prolonged hospitalization, but the probability of floor detection increased with the duration of the local pandemic wave. CONCLUSIONS: Distance from a patients bed did not predict SARS-CoV-2 RNA deposition in patient rooms, but surface type, severity of illness, and time from local pandemic wave predicted surface deposition.","output":"Spatial and temporal effects on severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contamination of the healthcare environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE to analyze the self-efficacy of elderly with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the relationship with sociodemographic, clinical, knowledge, and attitude variables.

This study aims provide a theoretical framework describing the stakeholder behaviours that arise in severely disrupted value chains, which give rise to inter-organisational initiatives that impact industry sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach is adopted, in which uncertainty theory and relational governance theory and structured interviews with 15 AVC stakeholders underpin the initial conceptual model. The framework is empirically validated via partial least squares structural equation modelling using data from an online survey of 185 AVC stakeholders based in India. Findings: The findings reveal that buyer and supplier uncertainty created by the COVID-19 lockdowns gives rise to behaviours that encourage stakeholders to engage in relational governance initiatives. Progressive farmers and other AVC stakeholders welcome this improved information sharing, which encourages self-reliance that positively impacts agricultural productivity and sustainability. Practical implications: The new framework offers farmers and other stakeholders in developing nations possibilities to sustain their AVCs even in dire circumstances. In India, this also requires an enabling ecosystem to enhance smallholders' marketing power and help them take advantage of recent agricultural reforms. Originality/value: Research is scarce into the impact of buyer and seller behaviour during extreme supply chain disruptions.

It is more accurate than radiography for this purpose and is considered to be the reference modality for imaging the feline kidney, providing excellent visualisation of renal size, shape and internal architecture. Compared with more advanced imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography is more accessible, less expensive, does not require general anaesthesia and allows real-time procedures to be performed. CLINICAL CHALLENGES On ultrasound examination, focal or multifocal disorders may be readily identified, but diffuse changes are more challenging. B-mode ultrasonography is of limited use for differentiating between benign and malignant focal lesions. However, based on the presence and pattern of vascularity as an indicator of malignancy, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography allows distinction between benign and malignant focal renal lesions.

Ten music-making session were scheduled for community-dwelling people living with dementia and care-partners, once a month between September 2019 and March 2020. Three sessions did not take place due to Covid19. Eighteen participants consented to take part including seven people living with dementia, five care-partners and six former care-partners.

Self-report questionnaires captured 'in the moment' experiences of each music-making cafe. Follow-up semi-structured interviews explored the impact of music-making on participants' self-reported well-being. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. The findings demonstrate that participating in the music-making caf benefitted the self-reported well-being of participants in three ways: first, a sense of camaraderie that enabled the facilitation of connections with others; second, creating opportunities to 'level the playing field' by always assuming a person's strengths and abilities; and third, group participation in music-making meets a need for meaningful musical experiences.

Surprisingly, all regions exhibited stable dopamine dynamics throughout habit development. VMS and DLS signals did not differ between habitual and non-habitual animals, but DMS dopamine release increased during action-sequence initiation and decreased during action-sequence completion in habitual rats, whereas non-habitual rats showed opposite effects.

In this report, a special case of cervicothoracic injury caused by foreign body penetration was elucidated. In this case, the injury location and the involved foreign body were exceptionally particular, which induced a challenging process of diagnosis and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A male patient suffered from a serious injury caused by a thick branch that pierced through his neck in a traffic accident between an electric car and a tricycle carrying wood. There were also local injuries in the left scapular region. After an emergency multidisciplinary consultation, the patient was diagnosed and subsequently treated with vascular exploration and repair (common carotid artery), intrathoracic foreign body extraction, chest exploration, debridement, and suture. After surgery, he was transferred to the emergency intensive care unit for anticoagulation and anti-infection treatment. Finally, after the improvement of his physical condition, the patient was transferred to the general ward for further treatment and was successfully discharged from the hospital. Once discharged, the patient lived a normal life, free from sequelae or complications. CONCLUSION: It may be an extremely daunting task to cure cervicothoracic penetrating injury due to its rare occurrence in clinical practice. Different from the previous cervicothoracic traumas, the injury location in this case is exceedingly particular. In general, the common cervicothoracic trauma is associated with damage to the trachea, esophagus, throat, and other structures, easily resulting in dyspnea, which, however, does not occur in this case. The insertion position of foreign body is exceptionally particular as it does not pierce the common carotid artery but poses compression on it, which induces ischemia. It is essential for the successful treatment that the treatment plan is formulated via the detailed imaging examination and careful multidisciplinary consultation.","output":"A case report of cervicothoracic penetrating injury with retention of foreign body"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last decade, active video games (exergames) have been proposed in obesity prevention and treatment as a potential tool to increase physical activity This review was aimed to assess the possible role of exergames in reducing weight-related outcomes among overweight/obese children and/or adolescents The databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus were interrogated to detect controlled studies involving healthy overweight/obese children and adolescents in interventions based exclusively on exergames Out of a total of 648 articles found, 10 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review The included studies differ for duration, setting and type of intervention, frequency of active game sessions, and outcomes considered Seven out of ten studies reported better outcomes in children/adolescents involved in the interventions, with significant differences between groups in four, while three studies found better outcomes in control groups These results suggest a possible positive effect of active video games on weight-related outcomes in obese children and adolescents However, further research is still needed to define if they can be effectively used in childhood obesity treatment and which may be the most effective approach The potentiality of the new digital media in this field should be explored","output":"Exergames in Childhood Obesity Treatment: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Here, we infer the infectiousness profile of COVID-19 infections using a mechanistic approach, and show that this method provides an improved fit to data from source-recipient pairs compared to previous studies. Our results indicate a higher proportion of presymptomatic transmissions than previously thought, with many transmissions occurring shortly before symptom onset.

One of the reasons is linked to the cases of elder abuse, not only shown by academic and scientific sources, but also by social and mass media and their impact on public perception of the institutional setting. What is more, current COVID-19 pandemic consequences on older people have provoked alarm and worry especially about what is happening in institutions. METHODS: The sample for this study consists of 286 staff working in nursing homes in Spain. This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Professional Good Care Scale in Nursing Homes (GCS-NH). RESULTS: Results of parallel analyses and exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) showed a four-factor model for the 32-item scale: humanization (9 items), non-infantilization (10 items), respect (7 items) and empowerment (6 items). Then, psychometric properties were tested analysing internal consistency (reliability) and convergent, divergent and criterion validity. High internal consistency (reliability) and different validity evidence were obtained for the total scores of the GCS-NH and its subscales. GCS-NH scores were also capable of detecting risk of probable institutional elder abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that this scale is an appropriate, valid, and reliable multidimensional instrument to evaluate good care in older institutionalized people by staff. Good care is an outcome of a complex construct in which a wide range of factors converge (staff, older people, and environmental characteristics). The GCS-NH has potential to be used as a multidimensional tool to assess good care.","output":"Validation of the professional good care scale in nursing homes (GCS-NH)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which is the histological surrogate for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has a multifactorial aetiology. Therefore it is possible that the immunopathology differs among the various presentations of DAD. The aim of this study is to compare lung immunopathology of viral (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) to non-viral, extrapulmonary aetiologies in autopsy cases with DAD. METHODS: The lung tissue of 44 patients, was divided in the H1N1 group (n = 15) characterized by severe pulmonary injury due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection; the ARDS group (n = 13), characterized by patients with DAD due to non-pulmonary causes; and the Control group (n = 16), consisting of patients with non-pulmonary causes of death. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis were used to quantify, in the parenchyma and small airways, several immune cell markers. RESULTS: Both DAD groups had higher expression of neutrophils and macrophages in parenchyma and small airways. However, there was a higher expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD83+ dendritic cells, granzyme A+ and natural killer + cell density in the lung parenchyma of the H1N1 group (p < 0.05). In the small airways, there was a lower cell density of tryptase + mast cells and dendritic + cells and an increase of IL-17 in both DAD groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: DAD due to viral A(H1N1)pdm09 is associated with a cytotoxic inflammatory phenotype, with partially divergent responses in the parenchyma relative to the small airways. In non-viral DAD, main immune cell alterations were found at the small airway level, reinforcing the role of the small airways in the pathogenesis of the exudative phase of DAD.

METHODS: We implemented audio-only prenatal virtual visits in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic within a large, county-based prenatal care system serving predominantly women with low socioeconomic status and limited resources. Using a four-question telephone survey, we surveyed a cross-section of patients who had opted to participate in virtual visits to assess their level of satisfaction surrounding audio-only visits. In addition, average clinic wait times and attendance rates by visit type were examined. RESULTS: From March 17 to May 31, 2020, more than 4,000 audio-only virtual prenatal visits were completed in our system. After implementation, the percentage of visits conducted through the virtual platform gradually rose, with nearly 25% of weekly prenatal visits being performed through the virtual platform by the month of May. Clinic wait times trended downward after implementation of virtual visits (P<.001). On average, 88% of virtual prenatal visits were completed as scheduled, whereas only 82% of in-person visits were attended (P<.001). Hospital administration attempted to contact 431 patients who had participated in at least one virtual visit to assess patient satisfaction; 283 patients were reached and agreed to participate (65%). Ninety-nine percent of respondents reported that their needs were met during their audio-only virtual visits. The majority of patients preferred a combination of in-person and virtual visits for prenatal care, and patients reported many benefits with virtual visits. CONCLUSION: Audio-only virtual prenatal visits-as a complement to in-person prenatal visits-have specific and distinct advantages compared with video-enabled telehealth in a vulnerable population of women and offer a viable option to increase access to care.","output":"Patient Perspectives on Audio-Only Virtual Prenatal Visits Amidst the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: Analisar e descrever a distribui??o espacial dos primeiros casos e bitos confirmados de COVID-19 do Rio de Janeiro e sua associa??o com o ndice de Desenvolvimento Social (IDS).

The study was aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic practice in India during the lockdown period and assess the preparedness of orthopaedic surgeons for resuming clinical practice after the initial lockdown was lifted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey of 35 questions was conducted to evaluate impact on (i) general orthopaedic practice (ii) hospital protocols (iii) out-patient practice (iv) surgical practice (v) personal protective equipment (PPE) use and (vi) post-lockdown preparedness. RESULTS: A total number of 588 practising orthopaedic surgeons from India completed the survey. Majority (88.3%) found severe impact (>50%) on trauma surgery and non-trauma surgery with significant reduction in out -patient attendance compared to corresponding time in 2019. There were significant changes made in individual hospital protocols (91.7 %). Appropriate required PPE was available in majority of the hospitals (74.3%). No remodelling or upgrading of the existing operating theatre infrastructure was done by most surgeons (89.5%). CONCLUSION: This pan India survey of orthopaedic surgeons has indicated that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on their outpatient and surgical trauma and non-trauma practice, due to the lockdown and resulted in significant changes to hospital protocols.

We provide here a multi-omics framework to probe the molecular basis of a multicomponent example herb, Cissampelos pareira L. (Cipa) used in the treatment of hormonal disorders and fever in Ayurveda. Cipa treated MCF7 cells exhibit downregulation of signatures of estrogen response. 38 constituent molecules in Cipa potentially bind ({triangleup}G< -7.5) with ER at the same site as estrogen. Cipa transcriptome signatures in the connectivity map exhibit positive scores with protein translation inhibitors and knockdown signatures of genes linked to the antiviral response. This includes the knockdown signature of RPL7, a coactivator of ESRI with a connectivity score > 99.92. This axis was found to be upregulated in the COVID-19 patient transcriptome.

A greater understanding of the relationship between functionally neutralising antibodies detected using microneutralisation assays and binding antibodies detected using scalable enzyme immunoassays (EIA) is needed in order to address protective immunity post-infection or vaccination, and assess EIA suitability as a surrogate test for screening of convalescent plasma donors. We assessed whether neutralising antibody titres correlated with signal cut-off ratios in five commercially available EIAs, and one in-house assay based on expressed spike protein targets. Sera from recovered patients or convalescent plasma donors who reported laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 200), and negative control sera collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 100), were assessed in parallel. Performance was assessed by calculating EIA sensitivity and specificity with reference to microneutralisation. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 166 (83%) samples. Compared with this, the most sensitive EIAs were the Cobas Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (98%) and Vitros Immunodiagnostic Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%), which detect total antibody targeting the N and S1 antigens, respectively. The assay with the best quantitative relationship with microneutralisation was the Euroimmun IgG. These results suggest the marker used (total Ab vs. IgG vs. IgA) and the target antigen are important determinants of assay performance. The strong correlation between microneutralisation and some commercially available assays demonstrates their potential for clinical and research use in assessing protection following infection or vaccination, and use as a surrogate test to assess donor suitability for convalescent plasma donation.","output":"SARS Coronavirus-2 Microneutralisation and Commercial Serological Assays Correlated Closely for Some but Not All Enzyme Immunoassays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics have significantly affected economy of each country.

Macroinvertebrate communities are usually studied with metabarcoding using the DNA extracted from their bodies bulk samples, which remains a time-consuming approach and involves the destruction of all individual specimens from the samples. The ability of biofilms to capture DNA was explored on 19 rivers sites of a tropical island (Mayotte Island, France). First, macroinvertebrate specimens were identified based on their morphological characteristics. Second, DNA was extracted from biofilms, and macroinvertebrate communities were targeted using a standard COI barcode. The resulting morphological and molecular inventories were compared. They provided comparable structures and diversities for macroinvertebrate communities when one is working with the unassigned OTU data. After taxonomic assignment of the OTU data, diversity and richness were no longer correlated. The ecological assessment derived from morphological bulk samples was conserved by the biofilms samples. We also showed that the biofilm method allows to detect a higher diversity for some organisms (Cnidaria), that is hardly accessible with the morphological method. The results of this study exploring the DNA signal captured by natural biofilms are encouraging.

However, it has been reported that the relationship between OM\\\\85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections is variable. This meta\\\\analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A systematic literature search up\\\\to May 2020 was performed and 14 studies were detected with 1859 paediatric subjects, of them 890 consumed OM\\\\85. They were reporting relationships between OM\\\\85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Odds ratio (OR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated to evaluate the prognostic role of OM\\\\85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections using the dichotomous or continuous method with a random or fixed\\\\effect model. RESULTS: OM\\\\85 consumption was significantly related to lower frequency of respiratory tract infections (MD, ?1.16; 95% CI, ?1.66 to ?0.65, P < .001); lower total duration of respiratory tract infections (MD, ?19.51; 95% CI, ?23.00 to ?16.01, P < .001); lower incidence of respiratory tract infections (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21\\\\0.77, P = .006); lower number of antibiotic courses (MD, ?1.40; 95% CI, ?2.63 to 0.17, P = .03); and lower antibiotic use (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29\\\\0.52, P < .001).

In the mixed treatment assay, six AK extracts [AK-1 (EtOH extract), AK-3 (H2O layer), AK-5 (40% methanol fraction), and AK-9C11 (H2O extract, polysaccharide fraction, supernatant fraction)] exhibited inhibitory activities against G5P[7] rotavirus with the EC50 values ranging from 0.70.4 to 33.76.5g/mL. Extracts AK-1, AK-3, and AK-5 inhibited rotavirus infection against G8P[7] rotavirus, the with EC50 values of 8.42.2g/mL, 6.50.8g/mL and 8.45.0g/mL, respectively. By hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, six AK extracts completely inhibited viral adsorption onto human RBCs in both strains of rotaviruses at less than 11g/mL. However, in the post treatment assay, there was no anti activity shown against both strains of rotaviruses. As a result, six AK extracts were attributed mainly to having a strong interaction with hemagglutinin protein on the outer surface of rotavirus, resulting to blockage of viral adsorption.","output":"Antiviral activity of Alpinia katsumadai extracts against rotaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Diabetes is reported as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, but whether this risk is similar in all categories of age remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients with and without diabetes according to age categories. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 6,314 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February and June 30 2020, and follow-up recorded until 30 September 2020, in the Paris metropolitan area, France. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The main outcome was a composite outcome of mortality and orotracheal intubation in subjects with diabetes compared with subjects without diabetes, after adjustment for confounding variables and according to age categories. RESULTS: Diabetes was recorded in 39% of subjects. Main outcome was higher in patients with diabetes, independently of confounding variables (HR 1.13 [1.03-1.24]) and increased with age in individuals without diabetes, from 23% for those <50 to 35% for those >80 years but reached a plateau after 70 in those with diabetes. In direct comparison between patients with and without diabetes, diabetes-associated risk was inversely proportional to age, highest in <50 and similar after 70 years. Similarly, mortality was higher in patients with diabetes (26%) than in those without diabetes (22%, p<0.001), but adjusted HR for diabetes was significant only in patients under 50 (HR 1.81 [1.14-2.87]). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes should be considered as an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in young adults more so than in older adults, especially for individuals younger than 70 years.","output":"Diabetes increases severe COVID-19 outcomes primarily in younger adults Age and diabetes in COVID-19 severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Globally, withCOVID-19 pandemic, elective dental services were stopped, and only urgent/ emergency conditions were managed face-to-face after tele-triage(TT). However, no previous researchexploredwhetherthe severity of orofacial/ dental pain (OFDP)drivesthe TT decisions.The current report undertook this task. METHODS This retrospective cross-sectional reportanalyzed the pain severity (PS) reported byhotline callers during the first COVID-19 lockdownand its association with patient's age,sex, history of chronic illness,and dental discipline required. PS was also compared across triage categories, associated dental history and tentative tele-diagnosis. PS was measured using self-reported numerical rating scale (NRS-11).Binomial logistic regression assessed the associationbetweenthe PS (exposure) and likelihoodof being referred for face to face management, controlling for age, sex, history of chronic illness, and dental discipline needed. ANOVA compared pain severity (PS) across dental history and tentative diagnosis. RESULTS PS was significantly associated with TT decisions (p<0.05). An increase in pain score by 1 unit was associated with 1.4 times increased odds of face-face referral. Pediatric/ adolescent patients (9-18 years) were 2.1 times more likely, and those with chronic illness were 2.12 times more likelyto be referred for face-to-facemanagement.Among the dental specialties, surgical and orthodontic specialties were each associated with increased odds of referral (1.9 and 7.016 respectively) compared to restorative specialties.The highest PS was highest for the emergency triage category (8.00  2.83, P< 0.0001),adults (6.29  2.1819, P< 0.0001),and the tentative tele-diagnosis of cellulitis (7.75  2.872, P< 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS TT decisions were significantly influenced by severity of patient-reported OFDP, adjusting for a range of variables. However, acute dental conditions were not referred when they were judged to be manageable remotely;and conversely, less acute dental conditions were given the attention they required and referred when they hadpotential life threating or quality of life implications.

However, recently, authors have called for more systematic and holistic approaches to tourism disaster management research. To address this gap, this study adopted a public relations perspective to refocus attention to relationships and stakeholder expectations of destination communities across multiple phases of disaster management. The authors used a mixed method approach and developed a battery of disaster management attributes by conducting interviews and analysing industry documents and the extant literature. These attributes formed part of a survey of tourism businesses. Exploratory Factor Analysis resulted in a two factor solution: i) business disaster preparedness, and ii) destination disaster response and recovery. Findings also show that participants reported a gap between the importance and destination performance of these attributes. In particular, tourism businesses perceived destinations did not adequately engage in disaster preparedness activities, which had implications for disaster response and recovery.","output":"Destinations, disasters and public relations: Stakeholder engagement in multi-phase disaster management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 (Corona virus Disease-2019) is a new public health emergency and is a pandemic currently. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 vary in different geographical areas. In this study we aimed to analyse the relationship between malaria transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map. Materials and methods: We collected malaria cases data (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2018), worldwide COVID-19 cases and mortality data (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and data on BCG vaccination. COVID-19 incidence and mortality was compared. Findings: Data on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were analysed. Malaria incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (correlation coefficient = -0.513, p<0.001). Malaria free countries had significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases compared to malaria endemic countries. In Europe and Americas, countries, which have higher BCG vaccination coverage, had significantly less mortality per thousand population compared to those with low BCG coverage (median 0.0002 (0-0.0005) vs 0.0029 (0.0002-0.0177), p=0.017). The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was related nonlinearly to the malaria incidence. Conclusions: The results suggest the changing human immune system as we progress to eliminate parasitic diseases with time.

We start with a discussion of how biomechanical properties of the body affect somatosensory feedback. We follow with the different types of mechanoreceptors and somatosensory afferents and their activity during locomotion. We then describe central projections to locomotor networks and the modulation of somatosensory feedback during locomotion and its mechanisms. We then discuss experimental approaches and animal models used to investigate the control of locomotion by somatosensory feedback before providing an overview of the different functional roles of somatosensory feedback for locomotion.

We implemented the use of 3D printed cardiac models of standard TTE views PLAX, PSAX, and A4C and assessed their efficacy in TTE-teaching. METHODS: One hundred fifty-three participants were split into two groups. A pre-test-retest of anatomy, 2D -, and 3D orientation was conducted. The intervention group (n = 77) was taught using 3D models; the control group (n = 76) without. Both were comparable with respect to baseline parameters. Besides test-scores, a Likert scale recorded experiences, difficulties, and evaluation of teaching instruments. RESULTS: From the 153 students evaluated, 123 improved, 20 did worse, and ten achieved the same result after the course. The median overall pre-test score was 29 of 41 points, and the retest score was 35 (p < 0.001). However, the intervention group taught with the 3D models, scored significantly better overall (p = 0.016), and in 2D-thinking (p = 0.002) and visual thinking (p = 0.006) subtests. A backward multivariate linear regression model revealed that the 3D models are a strong individual predictor of an excellent visual thinking score. In addition, our study showed that students with difficulty in visual thinking benefited considerably from the 3D models. CONCLUSION: Students taught using the 3D models significantly improved when compared with conventional teaching. Students regarded the provided models as most helpful in their learning process. We advocate the implementation of 3D-printed heart models featuring the standard views for teaching echocardiography.

However, it is noted that the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 did not arise from highly pathogenic influenza viruses, and the next pandemic may well arise from a low-pathogenicity virus. The rationale for particular concern about an H5N1 pandemic is not its inevitability but its potential severity. An H5N1 pandemic is an event of low probability but one of high human health impact and poses a predicament for public health.

Data regarding the epidemiology of COVID19 among patients with AIIRD is scarce. Objectives: To assess the pattern of COVID19 pandemic among patients with AIIRD compared to the general population in Israel Methods: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we established a national registry of patients with AIIRD, diagnosed with COVID-19, based on voluntary reporting by the treating rheumatologist. All the members of the Israeli Society of Rheumatology were encouraged to participate and repeatedly reminded to report any new cases. Rheumatology centers from 11 hospitals from the Northern and Central part of Israel participated in this study. The registry included demographic data, AIIRD diagnosis and duration, systemic organ involvement, co-morbidities, treatment (conventional synthetic disease modifying drugs (csDMARDs), biologic/targeted (b/ts) DMARDs, corticosteroids use, dose and treatment duration, date of COVID19 diagnosis, severity of the viral disease and complications, duration of hospitalization, if required, treatment for COVID 19, laboratory results and outcome. The diagnosis of COVID 19 was made by a positive SARS CoV2 PCR. The indications for SARS CoV2 PCR testing in Israel comprise clinical symptoms or exposure to a confirmed close contact. Severe illness was defined by SpO2 <94% in room air, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, PaO2/FiO2 <300 mm Hg, or lung infiltrates 50% on chest imaging. The epidemiological data regarding the number of COVID19 confirmed patients, the number of severe cases and the rate of mortality among the general population per day and per week, were extracted from the data dashboard of the Israeli Ministry of Health. We analyzed data from 02.2020 to 15.01.2021. Results: During the study period we experienced 3 waves of COVID 19 pandemic. The governmental management of COVID19 spread, at the beginning of the pandemic, included inforcement of severe travel restrictions and social distancing, followed eventually by a preventive lockdown, in spite of the relatively low number of cases. Easing of the restrictions, lifting the travel ban, opening of the commerce and schools led to 2 much more severe waves, which triggered 2 new lockdowns. Up to January 2021, 549763 Israelis had confirmed COVID19, 30% of whom had severe disease, 0.84% died (30% of the patients with severe disease). We identified 190 AIIRD patients (mean(SD) age 52(18), 30% males) who had confirmed COVID19. The weekly incidence curve of patients with rheumatic diseases correlated with the curve of the general population (Figure 1). Sixty-one % of the patients with AIIRD received csDMARDs, 41% were on b/ tsDMARDs, 39% on chronic corticosteroids, 12% on 10mg prednisone. Forty-seven% of patients required hospitalization, 20% had severe COVID19. Sixteen patients (42% of patients with severe COVID19) (mean(SD), median age 64.7(15.4),67)) died (systemic sclerosis-4 patients, rheumatoid arthritis -6, systemic lupus erythematosus -2, antiphospholipid syndrome-2, granulomatous polyangiitis -1, polymyalgia rheumatica-1). The AIIRD was active in 56% of them, 50% received csDMARDs, none of them were on b/tsDMARDs, 31% received chronic prednisone10 mg. All patients who died had at least 2 comorbidities. Conclusion: The pattern of spread of COVID19 in AIIRD patients is similar to the general population despite repeated mass media alerts for enhanced social distancing for elderly and immune suppressed patients. The disease tends to be more severe with enhanced mortality, especially in those with active AIIRD disease and organ involvement (lungs, heart, renal), older age and co-morbidities.

We sought to determine the effectiveness of thermal screening as a key step in diagnosing COVID-19 in a resource-limited setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study based on a review of body temperature and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 test results records for truck drivers entering Uganda through Mutukula between 15(th) May and 30(th) July 2020. All records missing information for body temperature, age, gender, and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 status were excluded from the data set. A data set of 7,181 entries was used to compare thermal screening and Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay test results using the diagnostic statistical test in STATAv15 software. The prevalence of COVID-19 amongst the truck drivers based on Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay results was determined. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive and negative Likelihood ratios were obtained using Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 assay as the gold standard. RESULTS: Based on our gold standard test, the proportion of persons that tested positive for COVID-19 was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.1C7.3). Of the 7,181 persons that were thermally screened, 6,844 (95.3%) were male. The sample median age was 38 years (interquartile range, IQR: 31C45 years). The median body temperature was 36.5C (IQR: 36.3C36.7) and only n (1.2%) had a body temperature above 37.5C. The sensitivity and specificity of thermal screening were 9.9% (95% CI: 7.4C13.0) and 99.5% (95% CI: 99.3C99.6) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 57.8 (95% CI: 46.5C68.6) and 93.9 (95% CI: 93.3C94.4) respectively.

METHOD Six weeks after the beginning of the confinement period, an online 10- question survey was sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacists. A single response per hospital was requested. The survey included questions on the provision of remote pharmaceutical care prior to the onset of the health crisis, patient selection criteria, procedures for home delivery of medications and the means used to deliver them, the number of patients who benefited from telepharmacy, and the number of referrals made. Finally, respondents were asked whether a teleconsultation was carried out before sending patients their medication and whether these deliveries were recorded. RESULTS A total of 39.3% (n = 185) of all the hospitals in the National Health System (covering all of Spain's autonomous regions) responded to the survey. Before the beginning of the crisis, 83.2% (n = 154) of hospital pharmacy services did not carry out remote pharmaceutical care activities that included telepharmacy with remote delivery of medication. During the study period, 119,972 patients were treated, with 134,142 deliveries of medication being completed. Most hospitals did not use patient selection criteria. A total of 30.2% of hospitals selected patients based on their personal circumstances. Home delivery and informed delivery (87%; 116,129 deliveries) was the option used in most cases. The means used to deliver the medication mainly included the use of external courier services (47.0%; 87 hospitals) or the hospital's own transport services (38.4%; 71 hospitals). As many as 87.6% of hospitals carried out teleconsultations prior to sending out medications and 59.6% recorded their telepharmacy activities in the hospital pharmacy appointments record. CONCLUSIONS The rate of implementation of telepharmacy in outpatient care in Spain during the study period in the pandemic was high.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospectively registered, triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PBMT-sMF in severe COVID-19 ICU patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PBMT-sMF or a placebo daily throughout their ICU stay. The primary outcome was length of ICU stay, defined by either discharge or death. The secondary outcomes were survival rate, diaphragm muscle function, and the changes in blood parameters, ventilatory parameters, and arterial blood gases. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included and equally randomized into the two groups. There were no significant differences in the length of ICU stay (mean difference, MD = ?6.80; 95% CI = ?18.71 to 5.11) between the groups. Among the secondary outcomes, significant differences were observed in diaphragm thickness, fraction of inspired oxygen, partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, C-reactive protein levels, lymphocyte count, and hemoglobin (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Among severe COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, the length of ICU stay was not significantly different between the PBMT-sMF and placebo groups. In contrast, PBMT-sMF was significantly associated with reduced diaphragm atrophy, improved ventilatory parameters and lymphocyte count, and decreased C-reactive protein levels and hemoglobin count.

Since limited data is known about the role of noninvasive parameters, we aimed to evaluate the role of a noninvasive parameter SpO2/FiO2 in independently predicting 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 and its prognostic utility in combination with a noninvasive score CRB-65. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in a tertiary training and research hospital, which included 272 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction in emergency department. Data on characteristics, vital signs, and laboratory parameters were recorded from electronic medical records. The primary outcome of the study was 30-day mortality, and we assessed the discriminative ability of SpO2/FiO2 in predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and its prognostic utility in combination with conventional pneumonia risk assessment scores. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that only SpO2/FiO2 level was found to be an independent parameter associated with 30-day mortality (OR:0.98, 95% CI: 0.98C0.99, p = 0.003). PSI and CURB-65 were found to be better scores than CRB-65 in predicting 30-day mortality (AUC: 0.79 vs 0.72, p = 0.04; AUC: 0.76 vs 0.72, p = 0.01 respectively). Both SpO2/FiO2 combined with CRB-65 and SpO2/FiO2 combined with CURB-65 have good discriminative ability and seemed to be more favorable than PSI in predicting 30-days mortality (AUC: 0.83 vs 0.75; AUC: 0.84 vs 0.75), however no significant difference was found (p = 0.21 and p = 0.06, respectively). CONCLUSION: SpO2/FiO2 is a promising index in predicting mortality. Addition of SpO2/FiO2 to CRB-65 improved the role of CRB-65 alone, however it performed similar to PSI. The combined noninvasive model of SpO2/FiO2 and CRB-65 may help physicians quickly stratify COVID-19 patients on admission, which is expected to be particularly important in hospitals still stressed by pandemic volumes.","output":"The role of a noninvasive index Spo2/ Fio2 in predicting mortality among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We found that the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had worsened depressive mood and apathy among the community-dwelling older adults, especially in older adults aged less than 75 years.","output":"Mental health status of the older adults in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we describe the case of a COVID-19 patient who developed recurring ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that acquired increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in response to treatment.

This allows the study of digestive processes and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies. However, detailed descriptions of the surgical procedure, perioperative management, a determination of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are scarce in the literature. Data of the long-term health status of minipigs upon EPI induction are still not available. Therefore, the present study describes in detail an experimental approach to the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency via pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs and the long term follow up of the animal's health state. METHODS 14 Goettingen minipigs underwent pancreatic duct ligation via midline laparotomy for the induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Fecal fat content, fat absorption, chymotrypsin levels, body weight and blood vitamin and glucose levels were determined. RESULTS Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was successfully induced in 12 Goettingen minipigs. Two minipigs failed to develop exocrine insufficiency most likely due to undetected accessory pancreatic ducts. All animals tolerated the procedure very well and gained weight within 8 weeks after surgery without requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The follow up for approx. 180 weeks showed a stable body weight and health state of the animals with normal blood glucose levels (Table 1). From approx. 130 weeks post pancreatic duct ligation, all animals were supplemented with pancreatic enzymes and vitamins resulting in blood concentrations almost within the reference range. CONCLUSIONS Pancreatic duct ligation in minipigs is an excellent method of inducing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is important to identify and ligate accessory pancreatic ducts since persistence of accessory ducts will lead to maintenance of exocrine pancreatic function. The EPI model caused no persistent side effects in the animals and has the potential to be used in long-term EPI studies with up to 100 weeks post-OP without supplementation with enzymes and vitamins.","output":"Long term follow-up of a simplified and less burdened pancreatic duct ligation model of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in Goettingen Minipigs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundCOVID-19 impacts the cardiovascular system resulting in myocardial damage and also affects the kidneys leading to renal dysfunction. This effect is mostly through the binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Neuropilin-1(NRP-l) receptors. Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) typically combine with microbial pathogens and provoke an inflammatory response. AimThis work aims to compare the changes in kidney and heart function bioindicators and expressions of TLRs (TLR2 and TLR2) as well as ACE2 and NRP-l receptors in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. The correlations between kidney and heart function bioindicators and expressions of these receptors are also studied. Patients and MethodsIn this study, 50 healthy control and 100 COVID-19 patients (55 male and 45 female) were enrolled. According to WHO guidelines, these participants were divided into severe (50 cases) and moderate (50 cases). Serum creatinine, blood urea, CKMB, LDH, and Troponin I were estimated. We measured the gene expression for Toll-Like Receptors (TLR2, TLR4), ACE2, and NRP-1 in the blood samples using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT -PCR). ResultsIn comparison with the healthy group, all patients exhibited a significant elevation in the serum creatinine, blood urea, cardiac enzymes, and CRP. As well, all studied patients revealed a significant elevation in the expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, ACE2, and NRP-1 mRNA. In all patients, CKMB, ACE2, and NRP-1 mRNA expression levels were positively correlated to both TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels. Moreover, serum creatinine and blood urea were positively correlated to both TLR2 and TLR 4 expression levels in the severe group only. ConclusionsOur study concluded that expression levels for TLR2, TLR4, ACE2, and NRP-1 mRNA in both severe and moderate patients were positively correlated with renal biomarkers and cardiac enzymes.

In the US, COVID-19 is now the third leading cause of death among those aged 45 through 84. Lung transplant (LTx) recipients may be at increased risk for fulminant novel SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 infection due to their immunosuppressed state. Within solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, the reported mortality rate has ranged from 5% to 40%. Observational studies of LTx recipients have noted a mortality rate of 10% to 34%. To further understand the mortality rate in LTx recipients, we retrospectively evaluated LTx patients at our center with COVID-19. Method: We identified LTx recipients infected with COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab at our institution in the Bay Area. Baseline demographics and clinical data were obtained through review of the electronic medical record (EMR) from 3/20/2020 to 12/18/20. Results: Eighteen LTx recipients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. The mean age was 55.1 years (SD  3.0) and the majority were male (Table 1). Eightynine percent of patients had 2 or more comorbidities, which included hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. Clinical presentation ranged from mild to severe, 11% of patients were monitored at home and 89% required hospitalization. Of those hospitalized, 50% were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The survival rate of COVID-19 in this population was 94%. One patient who recovered from COVID-19 later died in hospice care related to other comorbidities. Conclusion: Lung transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 were mostly male and most had two or more comorbidities. Most patients had severe infection requiring hospitalization and of these, half necessitated ICU level care. The overall survival rate, however, was higher than has been reported in LTx recipients at other centers. Favorable survival outcomes may be due to disease education and prompt access to healthcare in this LTx population. Additionally, during this study period, the Bay Area did not experience the same overwhelming surge of COVID-19 cases that has been seen in other regions of the United States.

Background Healthcare workers have a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection. The process of requesting pathology investigations is usually handled manually through the paper-based forms. We evaluated the potential of paper-based request forms to transmit COVID-19 to laboratory staff to make recommendations for dealing with hospital paperwork in a post COVID-19 world. Methods We tracked paper-based forms from time of test ordering till the release of the pathology report by calculating the time taken for the papers to reach the lab and the exposure of each staff group to the received papers from both high and moderate COVID-19 risk areas. Results Four hundred and thirty two (83%) out of 520 forms were received in the laboratory within 24 hours. The remaining 88 (17%) forms took 24 hours or more to be handled by lab personnel. The mean daily exposure time to the paperwork for various laboratory staff was as follows - receptionists: 2.7 minutes, technicians: 5.5 minutes and pathologists: 54.6 minutes. Conclusion More than 80% of the manual paper request forms will take less than 24 hours to be handled by laboratory personnel; carrying a high potential risk for viral transmission. We recommend replacing hardcopy paper-based request forms with electronic requests that could be printed in the laboratory if required.

Methods Family medicine clerkship students assigned to one community health center were invited to participate in this prospective, survey-based study. In their first week, students observed a preceptor performing EHR tasks. For the remainder of the 4-week clerkship, students utilized decision support tools, assigned a working diagnosis, entered unsigned orders in the EHR, proposed an assessment, and discussed a plan with a preceptor. Students completed weekly questionnaires to self-report confidence across several EHR domains while preceptors synchronously evaluated students' accuracy with entering orders correctly. Results From February 2017 to March 2020, all 49 eligible students completed the study. One hundred percent of students reported that placing EHR orders was beneficial to their medical education. The difference over time in learner confidence with placing EHR orders was statistically significant across every domain (eg, writing prescriptions, ordering labs and imaging).

RESULTS: In total, 117 surgical procedures were performed on 114 patients during the month of April 2020 compared with 1,107 performed in April 2019 (p< 0.0001). Retinal detachment repair was the most common procedure (37, 31.6%) in April 2020 while elective cataract surgery (481, 47.3%) was most common in April 2019. The mean age of patients was 50.0 years in April of 2020 compared to 59.0 years (p<0.0001) the year prior. During April 2020, the mean age of surgeons performing procedures was 42.3 years compared to 48.4 years (p<0.0001) during April 2019. In April 2020, all but 5 patients (96%) had RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing prior to their procedure. One patient (0.88%) had a positive COVID-19 test. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic decreased our institutions surgical volume in April 2020 to approximately 10% of the usual volume. The pandemic changed the type of cases performed and led to a statistically significant decrease in both the age of our surgeons and patients relative to the same interval in the year prior. Broad preoperative screening led to one positive COVID-19 test in an asymptomatic patient.","output":"Emergent Ophthalmic Surgical Care at a Tertiary Referral Center during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the cholera outbreak in Haiti demonstrated just how unprepared the country is to rapidly isolate an outbreak of this magnitude, and its vulnerability to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to investigate the role of micronutrients on the immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: To evaluate humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG, as well as the concentrations of different micronutrients, were determined in 36 convalescent COVID-19 patients 60 days after infection. Furthermore, the correlation between biochemical and hematological parameters, clinical features, and the changes in adiposity with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated. RESULTS: Serum IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in 38.8% and 83.3% of recovered patients after 60 days of COVID-19 infection, respectively. The values of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG were negatively correlated with the number of the platelet. Moreover, the values of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM were positively correlated with LDH and the vitamin B(12) concentration. Furthermore, a gender-specific association of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM with vitamins D as well as with B(9) and zinc was observed. A significant negative correlation was observed between the values of IgG with vitamin D in male participants and a positive correlation was detected between IgG values and B(9) in female participants. Moreover, IgM levels with serum zinc values in females were negatively correlated. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests the potential role of micronutrients in gender-specific humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Most countries initially deployed COVID-19 vaccines preferentially in elderly populations. Population-level vaccine effectiveness may be heralded by an increase in the proportion of deaths among non-elderly populations that were less covered by vaccination programs. Methods. We collected data from 40 countries on age-stratified COVID-19 deaths during the vaccination period (1/14/2021-5/31/2021) and two control periods (entire pre-vaccination period and excluding the first wave). We meta-analyzed the proportion of deaths in different age groups in vaccination versus control periods in countries with low vaccination rates; (2) countries with age-independent vaccination policies; and (3) countries with standard age-dependent vaccination policies. Findings. Countries that prioritized vaccination among older people saw an increasing share of deaths among 0-69 year old people in the vaccination versus the two control periods (summary prevalence ratio 1.32 [95 CI% 1.24-1.41] and 1.35 [95 CI% 1.26-1.44)]. No such change was seen on average in countries with age-independent vaccination policies (1.05 [95 CI% 0.78-1.41 and 0.97 [95 CI% 0.95- 1.00], respectively) and limited vaccination (0.93 [95 CI% 0.85-1.01] and 0.95 [95 CI% 0.87-1.03], respectively). Prevalence ratios were associated with the difference of vaccination rates in elderly versus non-elderly people. No significant changes occurred in the share of deaths in age 0-49 among all 0-69 deaths in the vaccination versus pre-vaccination periods. Interpretation. The substantial shift in the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths in countries that rapidly implemented vaccination predominantly among elderly may herald the population level-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination and a favorable evolution of the pandemic towards endemicity with fewer elderly deaths.

We investigated the therapeutic effect of HY1702, a new small molecule diterpene obtained from the processing and modification of Glaucocalyxin A and may exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. Specifically, we studied the anti-inflammatory effects of HY1702 on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells in vitro and its protective efficacy on lipopolysaccharide-induced mild acute respiratory distress syndrome in mice. Our results showed that HY1702 significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells and attenuated the secretion of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 by down-regulating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 in RAW264.7 cells. In mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced mild acute respiratory distress syndrome, HY1702 alleviated histological alterations in the lungs and reduced the alveolar cavity protein leakage and inflammatory cytokine expression in murine bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. HY1702 decreased the myeloperoxidase activity and lung wet to dry weight ratio. In our mechanism studies in lipopolysaccharide-exposed RAW264.7 cells, HY1702 suppressed the inflammation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide through inhibiting phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor B kinase subunit / (IKK/) and inhibitor of nuclear factor B subunit  (IB), further affecting the nuclear transfer of phosphorylated p65. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was inhibited.

We review recent studies dealing with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in kidney disease and hypertension, and discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity in the treatment of these diseases. RECENT FINDINGS In glomeruli from diabetic mice, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression is downregulated, and pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 leads to worsening of albuminuria, increased mesangial matrix deposition and fibronectin expression. The deletion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene in mice leads to worsening of angiotensin II-induced hypertension and has also been shown to cause glomerulosclerosis in aging male mice. SUMMARY Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system that favors the degradation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibition by pharmacological means and by genetic deletion worsens kidney disease in diabetic mice. Strategies geared to increasing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity may provide a novel therapeutic target within the renin-angiotensin system by enhancing angiotensin II degradation that may complement the current approach of inhibiting angiotensin II formation and action.

This study aimed to investigate the status of anxiety and depression and their associated factors in the adult, working-age population in Mainland China at the early remission stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online study was conducted among 1,863 participants in 29 provinces in Mainland China from March 23 to 31, 2020. Their mental health was evaluated by the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) and the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Descriptive analysis, Chi-square, and multiple logistic regressions were applied. RESULTS: About 44.5% of the participants had anxiety, 49.2% had depression, and 37.9% showed a combination of depression and anxiety. Around 83.7% of the participants claimed that the pandemic had a negative impact on their medical needs, which was the primary predictor of mental health, the degree of impact being positively related to the prevalence of anxiety and depression. More chronic diseases, moderate to bad self-rated health, severe perceived infection risk, and younger age group were the common risk factors for anxiety and depression. Having no children, unemployment, and a college-level educational background were associated with higher anxiety prevalence, whereas unmarried participants were correlated with higher depression prevalence.

Major disruptions to life, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, present an opportunity for a better understanding of the experience of stressors and vulnerability. Faster and better ways of psychological screening and tracking are more generally required in response to the increased demand upon mental health care services. The argument that mental and physical health should be considered together as part of a biopsychosocial approach is garnering acceptance in elite athlete literature. However, the sporting population are unique in that there is an existing stigma of mental health, an underrecognition of mental ill-health, and engagement difficulties that have hindered research, prevention, and intervention efforts. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this paper are to summarize and evaluate the literature on athletes increased vulnerability to mental ill-health and digital mental health solutions as a complement to prevention and intervention, and to show relationships between athlete mental health problems and resilience as well as digital mental health screening and tracking, and faster and better treatment algorithms. METHODS: This mini review shapes literature in the fields of athlete mental health and digital mental health by summarizing and evaluating journal and review articles drawn from PubMed Central and the Directory of Open Access Journals. RESULTS: Consensus statements and systematic reviews indicated that elite athletes have comparable rates of mental ill-health prevalence to the general population. However, peculiar subgroups require disentangling. Innovative expansion of data collection and analytics is required to respond to engagement issues and advance research and treatment programs in the process. Digital platforms, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence are useful for mental health screening and tracking in various subpopulations. It is necessary to determine appropriate conditions for algorithms for use in recommendations. Partnered with real-time automation and machine learning models, valid and reliable behavior sensing, digital mental health screening, and tracking tools have the potential to drive a consolidated, measurable, and balanced risk assessment and management strategy for the prevention and intervention of the sequelae of mental ill-health. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes are an at-risk subpopulation for mental health problems. However, a subgroup of high-level athletes displayed a resilience that helped them to positively adjust after a period of overwhelming stress. Further consideration of stress and adjustments in brief screening tools is recommended to validate this finding. There is an unrealized potential for broadening the scope of mental health, especially symptom and disorder interpretation. Digital platforms for psychological screening and tracking have been widely used among general populations, but there is yet to be an eminent athlete version. Sports in combination with mental health education should address the barriers to help-seeking by increasing awareness, from mental ill-health to positive functioning. A hybrid model of care is recommended, combining traditional face-to-face approaches along with innovative and evaluated digital technologies, that may be used in prevention and early intervention strategies.","output":"Psychological Screening and Tracking of Athletes and Digital Mental Health Solutions in a Hybrid Model of Care: Mini Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In the COVID-19 context, university teachers have had to face the most complex educational demands, psychosocial risks, and the anxiety of responding to limitations in terms of connectivity and fulfillment of academic objectives .

AIMS: To discuss how the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the health management of NCD patients, identify which aspects should be carried forward into future NCD management, and propose collaborative efforts among publicCprivate institutions to effectively shape NCD care models. METHODS: The NCD Partnership, a collaboration between Upjohn and the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, held a virtual Advisory Board in July 2020 with multiple stakeholders; healthcare professionals (HCPs), policymakers, researchers, patient and informal carer advocacy groups, patient empowerment organizations, and industry experts. RESULTS: The Advisory Board identified barriers to NCD care during the COVID-19 pandemic in four areas: lack of NCD management guidelines; disruption to integrated care and shift from hospital-based NCD care to more community and primary level care; infodemics and a lack of reliable health information for patients and HCPs on how to manage NCDs; lack of availability, training, standardization, and regulation of digital health tools. CONCLUSIONS: Multistakeholder partnerships can promote swift changes to NCD prevention and patient care. Intra- and inter-communication between all stakeholders should be facilitated involving all players in the development of clinical guidelines and digital health tools, health and social care restructuring, and patient support in the short-, medium- and long-term future.

However, the scientific landscape on the integration of GIS in COVID-related studies is largely unknown. In this systematic review, we assessed the current evidence on the implementation of GIS and other geospatial tools in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We systematically retrieved and reviewed 79 research articles that either directly used GIS or other geospatial tools as part of their analysis. We grouped the identified papers under six broader thematic groups based on the objectives and research questions of the study- environmental, socio-economic, and cultural, public health, spatial transmission, computer-aided modeling, and data mining. Results: The interdisciplinary nature of how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19 research was notable among the reviewed papers. Geospatial techniques, especially WebGIS, have even been widely used to visualize the data on a map and were critical to informing the public regarding the spread of the virus, especially during the early days of the pandemic.

Rapid detection is crucial to reduce their spread and prevent infections and outbreaks. OBJECTIVES To evaluate a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (called NG-Test VanA) for the rapid and reliable detection of VanA-producing VRE (VanA-VRE) from colonies and broth. METHODS NG-Test VanA was validated on 135 well-characterized enterococcal isolates grown on Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar (including 40 VanA-VRE). Different agar plates and culture broths widely used in routine laboratories for culture of enterococci were tested. RESULTS All 40 VanA-VRE clinical isolates were correctly detected in less than 15 min irrespective of the species expressing the VanA ligase and the medium used for bacterial growth. No cross-reaction was observed with any other clinically relevant ligases (VanB, C1, C2, D, E, G, L, M and N). Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 100% for VanA-VRE grown on MH agar plates. NG-Test VanA accurately detects VanA-VRE irrespective of the culture medium (agar and broth). Band intensity was increased when using bacteria grown on vancomycin-containing culture media or on MH close to the vancomycin disc as a consequence of VanA induction. The limit of detection of the assay was 6.3  106 cfu per test with bacteria grown on MH plates and 4.9  105 cfu per test with bacteria grown on ChromID? VRE plates.

However, previous studies have shown that the BAI has limited accuracy for children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: We propose to develop and validate an adjusted BAI for use in male children and adolescents from 7 to 17 years of age. METHODS: The sample consisted of 141 physically active male children and adolescents (age: 12.5  2.14). The %F was determined by X-ray dual energy absorptometry equipment (DXA) as the standard method and by BAI, using an equation that uses height and hip circumference. Arithmetic modeling was used to adjust the structure of the BAI mathematical model. RESULTS: The BAI arithmetic adjustment was successful, resulting in the mathematical model named in the present study of adjusted body adiposity index (BAIADJ ). BAI and BAIADJ correlated with DXA (r &#8804; .70, p < .001). Regression analyzes indicate that, BAI (CI 95% ?: [1.35; 1.90], p < .0001) and BAIADJ (CI 95% ?: [1.40; 1.90], p < .0001) have the potential to estimate %F. BAI pointed out a difference in relation to DXA (p = .04). While there was no difference between BAIADJ and DXA (p = .1). There was a proportion bias of 13.2% for BAI (p < .05), but not for BAIADJ (p > .05). CONCLUSION: The adjusted model of the body adiposity index proves to be an effective tool for the analysis of the fat percentage in young males. In addition, it demonstrated significant degrees of agreement and validity in relation to DXA.","output":"Body adiposity index to analyze the percentage of fat in young men aged between 7 and 17 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute viral respiratory infections are the most common infections in humans. Co-infection with different respiratory viruses is well documented but not necessarily well understood. The aim of this study was to utilise laboratory data from the winter season following the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) outbreak to investigate rates of respiratory virus co-infections, virus prevalence in different age groups and temporal variations in virus detection. The Health Protection Agency Public Health Laboratory (HPA PHL) Birmingham, UK, routinely uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect common respiratory viruses. The results from specimens received for respiratory virus investigations from late September 2009 to April 2010 were analysed. A total of 4,821 specimen results were analysed. Of these, 323 (13.2 %) had co-detections of two viruses, 22 (0.9 %) had three viruses and four (0.2 %) had four viruses. Reciprocal patterns of positive or negative associations between different virus pairs were found. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of negative associations between influenza A and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and influenza A and rhinovirus. Positive associations between parainfluenza with rhinovirus, rhinovirus with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus with rhinovirus, parainfluenza and RSV were also significant. Age and temporal distributions of the different viruses were typical. This study found that the co-detection of different respiratory viruses is not random and most associations are reciprocal, either positively or negatively. The pandemic strain of influenza A(H1N1) was notable in that it was the least likely to be co-detected with another respiratory virus.","output":"Respiratory viral infections during the 2009C2010 winter season in Central England, UK: incidence and patterns of multiple virus co-infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary renal angiosarcoma (AS) encompasses only 1% of soft tissue sarcomas, and it is seldom seen in literature.

Obtaining a cohesive overview of multiple single cell samples is difficult and requires consideration of cell population structure - which may or may not be well defined - along with subtle shifts in expression within cell populations across samples, and changes in population frequency across samples. Ideally, all this would be integrated with the experimental design, e.g. time point, genotype, treatment etc. Data visualisation is the most effective way of communicating analysis but often this takes the form of a plethora of TSNE plots, colour coded according to marker and sample. In this manuscript, I introduce a novel exploratory data analysis and visualisation method that is centred around a novel quasi-distance (DensityMorph) between single cell samples. DensityMorph makes it possible to plot single cell samples in a manner analogous to performing principal component analysis on microarray samples. Biological interpretation is ensured by the introduction of Explanatory Components, which show how marker expression and coexpression drive the differences between samples. This method is a breakthrough in terms of displaying the most pertinent biological changes across single cell samples in a compact plot. Finally, it can be used either as a stand-alone method or to structure other types of analysis such as manual flow cytometry gating or cell population clustering.","output":"Comparing single cell datasets using DensityMorph"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has provoked a second pandemic, the long-haulers, i e , individuals presenting with post-COVID symptoms We propose that to determine the presence of post-COVID symptoms, symptoms should appear after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection;however, this situation has some problems due to the fact that not all people infected by SARS-CoV-2 receive such diagnosis Based on relapsing/remitting nature of post-COVID symptoms, the following integrative classification is proposed: potentially infection related-symptoms (up to 4C5 weeks), acute post-COVID symptoms (from week 5 to week 12), long post-COVID symptoms (from week 12 to week 24), and persistent post-COVID symptoms (lasting more than 24 weeks) The most important topic is to establish the time reference points The classification also integrates predisposing intrinsic and extrinsic factors and hospitalization data which could promote post-COVID symptoms The plethora of symptoms affecting multiple systems exhibited by long-haulers suggests the presence of different underlying mechanisms","output":"Defining Post-COVID Symptoms (Post-Acute COVID, Long COVID, Persistent Post-COVID): An Integrative Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear-explosive (CBRNe) are complex events. Decontamination is mandatory to avoid harm and contain hazardous materials, but can delay care. Therefore, the stabilization of patients in the warm zone seems reasonable, but research is limited. Moreover, subjects involved in biological events are considered infectious even after decontamination and need to be managed while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), as seen with Ebola and COVID-19 pandemic. With this simulation mannequin trial, we assessed the impact of CBRNe PPE on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and combat casualty care procedures. METHODS: We compared procedures performed by emergency medicine and anesthesiology senior residents, randomized in 2 groups (CBRNe PPE vs. no PPE). Chest compression (CC) depth was defined as the primary outcome. Time to completion was calculated for the following: tourniquet application; tension pneumothorax needle decompression; peripheral venous access (PVA) and intraosseous access positioning; and drug preparation and administration. A questionnaire was delivered to evaluate participants' perception. RESULTS: Thirty-six residents participated. No significant difference between the groups in CC depth (mean difference = 0.26 cm [95% confidence interval = -0.26 to 0.77 cm, P = 0.318]), as well as for CC rate, CC complete release, and time for drugs preparation and administration was detected. The PPE contributed to significantly higher times for tourniquet application, tension pneumothorax decompression, peripheral venous access, and intraosseous access positioning. The residents found simulation relevant to the residencies' core curriculum.

One difficulty faced by clinicians and by patients is the unknown time frame of hospitalization until discharge of symptomatic patients. METHODS: We followed 34 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who recovered from the infection. All diagnoses were given using semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. Envelope protein gene (E), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRP), and nucleocapsid gene (N) were measured by RT-PCR. Weight was measured and height was self-reported. RESULTS: Mean  SD age was 51.8  16.7 years. Mean  SD body mass index (BMI) was 27.4  4.7 kg/m2. 26% (9/34) had obesity, with BMI above 30 kg/m2. Fifteen patients had BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2. The mean length of hospital stay was longer for those with a BMI >25 kg/m2 (n = 24) than for those with a normal BMI (19.2 vs. 16.0 days, p = 0.08). Comparing people with obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2 or above) to those without obesity, the difference was larger (20.6 vs. 16.0 days, p = 0.06).

This retrospective analysis of a UK centre's experience provides insight into clinical and radiographic outcomes. METHODS Electronic patient records, diagnostic and procedural images and written procedural records for patients treated with the PED between August 2009 and April 2014 were reviewed. Follow-up TOF MRA was performed after treatment. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were analyzed and compared with other PED studies. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients with 30 attempted PED treatments were reviewed representing 3.5% of the treated aneurysm patient cohort. 63.6% (21/33) of the aneurysms were wide-necked (>4 mm), 60.6% (20/33) were large or giant (10 mm). The mean aneurysm sac diameter was 12.0 mm; the mean neck width was 4.5 mm. Mortality and morbidity rates were 3.3% and 10.0%, respectively. The total adequate occlusion rate was 78.1% (25/32) at 18 months. The neck width of aneurysms with residual sac filling and complete occlusion differed significantly (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Highly selected aneurysms treated with a PED in a UK centre have similar occlusion and complication rates when compared to non-UK studies. Again, it appeared that delayed aneurysm rupture remained a risk for PED treatment in large or giant aneurysms. Follow-up with TOF MRA gave similar occlusion results compared to those obtained with DSA in other studies.

The purpose of these discharge instructions is to assist and provide guidance for physicians, nurses, and other health care personnel involved in discharging COVID-19 patients to home after encounters at hospitals, emergency departments, urgent care settings, and medical offices. METHODS: A systematic literature-search of studies evaluating both symptoms and signs of COVID-19 was performed in order to establish specific optimal performance criteria in monitoring a patients status with regard to disease safety. These optimal performance criteria parameters were considered with regard to the severity of morbidity and mortality. Strategies used to develop the discharge instructions included review of a broad spectrum of literature to develop the discharge criteria. RESULTS: These guidelines are presented for patient education and should achieve the essential goals including: enabling patients to understand their medical situation, preventing complications, supporting patients by providing instructions, helping patients make more effective use of available health services, and managing patient stress by giving patients comfort through the knowledge of specific recommendations including how to respond to situations. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic requires clinicians to efficiently teach their patients self-management strategies and to provide a safe educated response to the patient and the surrounding community environment.

There are limited data available on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with hematological malignancies with more than 60 days of follow-up. This study describes the clinical characteristics, including multiple recurrences of COVID-19, in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) during 69 days of follow-up. Case Presentation: A 72-year-old female was admitted to hospital isolation after being infected with COVID-19 as part of a family cluster on January 30, 2020. Apart from SARS-Cov-2 virus infection, laboratory results revealed lymphocytosis of uncertain etiology and abnormal distribution of T lymphocytes. On blood smears, small blue lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm were observed, and the presence of high levels of circulating clonal B cells was also demonstrated by flow cytometry. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and CLL. Among her family members, she had the highest viral loads and the fastest progression on lung injury and developed severe pneumonia. Serological results showed she had both 2019-nCoV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; however, only IgG antibodies were detected in her husband's plasma. Results: A combination regimen of antiviral therapy and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the early stage seemed to be effective for treating CLL and SARS-Cov-2 infection. Because of the low humoral immune response, the CLL patient could not effectively clear the SARS-Cov-2 infection and suffered from recurrence twice during the 69-day follow-up. Conclusion: In CLL, a neoplastic antigen-specific B-cell clone proliferates, and the progeny cells accumulate and outgrow other B cells, leading to immune deficiency. Considering the low humoral immune response and ineffective clearance of SARS-Cov-2 in CLL patients, the follow-up and home quarantine period should be extended. We need further studies to clarify suspending or continuing CLL therapy during COVID infection. For those patients who are prone to progression to severe disease, administering humoral immunity therapies can help to prevent disease progression and quickly meet the cure criteria.","output":"Low Humoral Immune Response and Ineffective Clearance of SARS-Cov-2 in a COVID-19 Patient With CLL During a 69-Day Follow-Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUES: Numerous studies have examined the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on alcohol use changes in Europe, with concerns raised regarding increased use and related harms. APPROACH: We synthesised observational studies published between 1 January 2020 and 31 September 2021 on self\\\\reported changes in alcohol use associated with COVID\\\\19. Electronic databases were searched for studies evaluating individual data from European general and clinical populations. We identified 646 reports, of which 56 general population studies were suitable for random\\\\effects meta\\\\analyses of proportional differences in alcohol use changes. Variations by time, sub\\\\region and study quality were assessed in subsequent meta\\\\regressions. Additional 16 reports identified were summarised narratively. KEY FINDINGS: Compiling reports measuring changes in overall alcohol use, slightly more individuals indicated a decrease than an increase in their alcohol use during the pandemic [3.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00C7.6%]. Decreases were also reported more often than increases in drinking frequency (8.0%, 95% CI 2.7C13.2%), quantity consumed (12.2%, 95% CI 8.3C16.2%) and heavy episodic drinking (17.7%, 95% CI 13.6C21.8%). Among people with pre\\\\existing high drinking levels/alcohol use disorder, high\\\\level drinking patterns appear to have solidified or intensified. IMPLICATIONS: Pandemic\\\\related changes in alcohol use may be associated with pre\\\\pandemic drinking levels. Increases among high\\\\risk alcohol users are concerning, suggesting a need for ongoing monitoring and support from relevant health\\\\care services.

NICE guidance states that diet-related deficiency can be treated orally, but pernicious anaemia must be excluded via anti-intrinsic factor antibodies (anti-IFAB). Our aim was to audit the management of B12 deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic when reducing footfall is vital. Then, implement staff education strategies to improve adherence to guidance. METHODS: Data for patients who received IMH from March-June 2020 was retrospectively analysed for: full blood count (FBC), B12, folate and anti-IFAB levels. These patients were sent letters to have blood tests for the missing investigations. Results were presented at meetings and flowchart-posters were distributed. Audit was closed with prospective data for patients who requested IMH from September-October 2020. RESULTS: From 46 patients identified, 82.6% had B12 and folate checked prior to therapy commencement, but 23.7% had an untreated folate deficiency. 79.3% of patients receiving IMH had never been tested for anti-IFAB; none of those tested were positive. A lack of awareness of the NICE guidance was identified as a key cause for non-adherence. Following the intervention, all 34 patients were appropriately investigated. Out of these, 8.8% had positive anti-IFAB levels and following a review of their clinical histories, all patients were commenced on appropriate therapy. DISCUSSION: IMH can have great benefit; but it is invasive, has financial and nursing-time implications, and increases the risk of contagion via footfall in the practice. Thus, this multi-cycle audit shows that appropriate investigations prior to commencing therapy is key.","output":"P77 Management of vitamin B12 deficiency in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Do all patients need to come in?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Viral diseases such as influenza, which are easily transferable from person to person or even country to country, pose one of the biggest threats to health today. Viruses such as avian influenza viruses (N1H5 and H9N1) have been reported to spread in the present decade and, very recently, the novel coronavirus that has caused many life-threatening illnesses and deaths all around the world has received much attention. To prevent these highly contagious viral infections, we have proposed the combination of IMOD? and Arbidol to increase their immunomodulatory effects as a novel medicine to prevent and cure influenza and some other infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C. On the one hand, IMOD? within the last few years has been proven to safely and effectively increase the life expectancy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals by increasing CD4 lymphocytes. On the other hand, Arbidol, an antiviral agent has been used safely and effectively in the past two decades to prevent and cure all types of influenza and flu. Therefore, the combination of both in a single dosage to further increase CD4 lymphocytes and interferon gamma (IFN-) could be a better choice for treatment of viral infections.

The processes for ordering screening mammography often rely on a health care provider order and a scheduler to arrange the time and location of breast imaging. Self-scheduling after automated ordering of screening mammograms may offer a more efficient and convenient way to schedule screening mammograms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the use, outcomes, and efficiency of an automated mammogram ordering and invitation process paired with self-scheduling. METHODS: We examined appointment data from 12 months of scheduled mammogram appointments, starting in September 2019 when a web and mobile app self-scheduling process for screening mammograms was made available for the Mayo Clinic primary care practice. Patients registered to the Mayo Clinic Patient Online Services could view the schedules and book their mammogram appointment via the web or a mobile app. Self-scheduling required no telephone calls or staff appointment schedulers. We examined uptake (count and percentage of patients utilizing self-scheduling), number of appointment actions taken by self-schedulers and by those using staff schedulers, no-show outcomes, scheduling efficiency, and weekend and after-hours use of self-scheduling. RESULTS: For patients who were registered to patient online services and had screening mammogram appointment activity, 15.3% (14,387/93,901) used the web or mobile app to do either some mammogram self-scheduling or self-cancelling appointment actions. Approximately 24.4% (3285/13,454) of self-scheduling occurred after normal business hours/on weekends. Approximately 9.3% (8736/93,901) of the patients used self-scheduling/cancelling exclusively. For self-scheduled mammograms, there were 5.7% (536/9433) no-shows compared to 4.6% (3590/77,531) no-shows in staff-scheduled mammograms (unadjusted odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36; P<.001). The odds ratio of no-shows for self-scheduled mammograms to staff-scheduled mammograms decreased to 1.12 (95% CI 1.02-1.23; P=.02) when adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity. On average, since there were only 0.197 staff-scheduler actions for each finalized self-scheduled appointment, staff schedulers were rarely used to redo or clean up self-scheduled appointments. Exclusively self-scheduled appointments were significantly more efficient than staff-scheduled appointments. Self-schedulers experienced a single appointment step process (one and done) for 93.5% (7553/8079) of their finalized appointments; only 74.5% (52,804/70,839) of staff-scheduled finalized appointments had a similar one-step appointment process (P<.001). For staff-scheduled appointments, 25.5% (18,035/70,839) of the finalized appointments took multiple appointment steps. For finalized appointments that were exclusively self-scheduled, only 6.5% (526/8079) took multiple appointment steps. The staff-scheduled to self-scheduled odds ratio of taking multiple steps for a finalized screening mammogram appointment was 4.9 (95% CI 4.48-5.37; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Screening mammograms can be efficiently self-scheduled but may be associated with a slight increase in no-shows. Self-scheduling can decrease staff scheduler work and can be convenient for patients who want to manage their appointment scheduling activity after business hours or on weekends.","output":"The Effect of Automated Mammogram Orders Paired With Electronic Invitations to Self-schedule on Mammogram Scheduling Outcomes: Observational Cohort Comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world at large has been confronted with several disease outbreaks which have posed and still posing a serious menace to public health globally. Recently, COVID-19 a new kind of coronavirus emerge from Wuhan city in China and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. There has been reported case of about 10,021,401 with global death of 499,913 as of 15.15 GMT, June 29 2020. There are 382,190 and 9664 positive cases and deaths in Africa, respectively as of June 29 at 7:00 GMT. South-Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana, Algeria and Cameroon are the most affected African countries with this outbreak. The chapter referred to them in this study as Africa epicenters. Thus, there is a need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence in this region for effective control and management. Different statistical tools and time series model such as the linear regression model and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have been applied for disease prevalence/incidence prediction in different diseases outbreak. This book chapter adopted the linear regression model and the ARIMA models to forecast the trend of COVID-19 prevalence in the aforementioned African countries. The datasets examined in this analysis spanned from February 21, 2020, to October 4, 2020, and was extracted from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website. The cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 cases were subjected to different curve estimation statistical models in simple, quadratic, cubic, and quartic forms. In the chapter, we identified the best model in each country and use the same for prediction and forecasting purposes. In conclusion, we obtained the future trend of this virus across Africa epicenters and this, in turn, will assist the government and health authorities to plan and take precautions that will help to curb this pandemic in Africa. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Robust Statistical Modeling of COVID-19 Prevalence in African Epicentres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the COVID-19 pandemic that appears to confer on the virus greater infectivity and now globally is the dominant form of the virus.

To determine whether D614G mediates neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 Spike on their surface. In all cases, G614 Spike pseudovirions were moderately more susceptible to neutralization, indicating this is not an escape mutation that would impede current vaccines.

Methods: Following a cohort of 21,242 HCWs in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for 20 months since the pandemic started, we used Cox regression and test-negative design to examine differences in SARS-COV-2 infection rates compared to community counterparts, and within the HCW workforce, assessing the role of occupation, testing accessibility, vaccination rates, and vaccine effectiveness over time. Results: Nurses, allied health professionals and medical staff in this jurisdiction had a significantly lower rate of infection compared to their age-group community counterparts, at 47.4, 41.8, and 55.3% reduction respectively; controlling for vaccine-attributable reductions, the protective impact was still substantial, at 33.4, 28.0, and 36.5% respectively. Licensed practical nurses and care aides had the highest risk of infection among HCWs, more than double that of medical staff. However, even considering differences in vaccination rates, no increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection was found compared to community rates, with combined protective measures beyond vaccination associated with a 17.7% reduced SARS-COV-2 rate in the VCH workforce overall. There was also no evidence of waning immunity within at least 200 days after second dose. Conclusion: Rigorously implemented occupational health, public health and infection control measures results in a well-protected healthcare workforce with infection rates at or below rates in community counterparts. Greater accessibility of vaccination worldwide is essential; however, as implementing measures to protect this workforce globally also requires considerable health system strengthening in many jurisdictions, we caution against overly focusing on vaccination to the exclusion of other crucial elements for wider protection of HCWs, especially in facing ongoing mutations which may escape current vaccines.","output":"Healthcare worker risk of COVID-19: A 20-month analysis of protective measures from vaccination and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 63-year-old man with active COVID-19 infection and a history of coronary artery bypass grafting presented with acute thrombotic occlusion of saphenous venous graft which was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery.

We also studied the preoperative factors which can predict EPE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our institute, 294 patients underwent robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) between December 2012 and August 2016. In this era, we performed MRI after biopsy to determine clinical stage before surgery. PI-RADS v2 scores were retrospectively reviewed using biparametric MRI and EPE in pathological mapping of resected specimens for each lobe. RESULTS: In the excised specimen, EPE was observed in 73 lobes (12%). The percentage of EPE by PI-RADS v2 score was score '1': 6% (17/297 lobes), '2': 3% (1/33 lobes), '3': 12% (8/67 lobes), '4': 19% (27/139 lobes), and '5': 38% (20/52 lobes). The higher the PI-RADS score, the higher the percentage of EPE (P <0.01). When classified as PI-RADS score 4 and <4, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 24.6% (47/191 lobes, 95%CI: 0.187 - 0.313) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 93.5% (371/397 lobes, 95%CI: 0.906 - 0.957). By multivariate analysis, positive biopsy core percentage 60%, and PI-RADS score 4 were independent factors for predicting EPE. The positive rate of EPE in lobes with zero, one and two factors (PI-RADS 4 and positive biopsy core percentage 60%) was 4%, 19%, and 38%, respectively.

METHODS: The molecular docking of CHM with the SARS-Cov-2 3CL hydrolase and the ACE2 converting enzyme, which were taken as the targets, was achieved by the Autodock Vina software. The CHM monomers acting on 3CLpro and ACE2 receptors were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform, the active ingredients were selected, and the key CHMs and compounds were speculated. Based on the perspective of network pharmacology, the chemical-target network was constructed, and the functional enrichment analysis of gene ontology and the pathway enrichment analysis of Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes were carried out by DAVID to speculate about the mechanism of action of the core drug pairs. RESULTS: There are 6 small molecule compounds that have the optimal binding energy with the two target proteins.

METHODS: A systematical search will be performed in PubMed, EMBase, ISI Knowledge via Web of Science and preprint databases (MedRxiv and BioRxiv) (until October 2021) to identify all cohort studies in adult patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome will be the incidence of RV involvement (dysfunction and/or dilation) assessed by echocardiography, CT or MRI. Secondary outcomes will include the risk factors for RV involvement and their association with all-cause mortality during hospitalisation. Additional outcomes will include the RV global or free wall longitudinal strain (RV-GLS or RV-FWLS), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), fractional area change (FAC) and RV diameter. Univariable or multivariable meta-regression and subgroup analyses will be performed for the study design and patient characteristics (especially acute or chronic pulmonary embolism and pulmonary hypertension).

PATIENTS/METHODS: COVID\\\\19 patients hospitalised in ICU during 1\\\\year period (August 2020 to August 2021) were included. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of all COVID\\\\19 patients, applied treatments, and invasive procedures that may predispose to candidemia were recorded. RESULTS: Of 1229 COVID\\\\19 patients, 63 developed candidemia. Candidemia incidence rate was 4.4 episodes per 1000 ICU days. The most common species was Candida albicans (52.3%). Only 37 patients (58.7%) received antifungal therapy. The presence of central venous catheter (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.8C12.2, p < .005), multifocal candida colonisation (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4C5.2, p < .005), a prolonged ICU stay (14 days) (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.08C3C37, p < .05), the absence of chronic lung disease (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1C0.9, p < .05) and the absence of corticosteroid use (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.14C0.52, p < .0001) were significantly associated with candidemia.

Within a \\"treatment on a named-patient basis\\" approach, Adrecizumab was administered to eight extreme-critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patients received a single dose of Adrecizumab, which was administered between 1 and 3 days after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. The SOFA (median 12.5) and SAPS-II (median 39) scores clearly documented the population at highest risk. Moreover, six of the patients suffered from acute renal failure, of whom five needed renal replacement therapy. The length of follow-up ranged between 13 and 27 days. Following the Adrecizumab administration, one patient in the low-dose group died at day 4 due to fulminant pulmonary embolism, while four were in stable condition, and three were discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU). Within 12 days, the SOFA score, as well as the disease severity score (range 0-16, mirroring critical resources in the ICU, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), decreased in five out of the seven surviving patients (in all high-dose patients). The PaO2/FiO2 increased within 12 days, while the inflammatory parameters C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 decreased.

Sexual selection is argued to explain these differences, but empirical evidence is limited. Here, we explore sex differences in immunity, oxidative physiology and packed cell volume of wild, adult, breeding birds (97 species, 1997 individuals, 14 230 physiological measurements). We show that higher female immune indices are most common across birds (when bias is present), but oxidative physiology shows no general sex-bias and packed cell volume is generally male-biased. In contrast with predictions based on sexual selection, male-biased sexual size dimorphism is associated with male-biased immune measures. Sexual dichromatism, mating system and parental roles had no effect on sex-specificity in physiology. Importantly, female-biased immunity remained after accounting for sexual selection indices. We conclude that cross-species differences in physiological sex-bias are largely unrelated to sexual selection and alternative explanations should be explored.","output":"Sexual dimorphism in immune function and oxidative physiology across birds: The role of sexual selection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report COVID-19 presentation, course and outcomes in teriflunomide-treated MS patients in Argentina.

In this study, our objective was to identify and characterize procedural steps, intraoperative distractions, errors, and threats, as well as the non-technical skills of the team during a common minimally invasive gynecologic procedure. Methodology This was a cross-sectional pilot study of 25 patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy between May 2019 and February 2020 at a Canadian tertiary care academic hospital. Video, audio, and patient physiologic data from all procedures were obtained through a multichannel synchronized recording device (ORBB). Trained analysts reviewed and coded the recordings. Results The median total case time was 165 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 160-178 minutes) with the shortest step being cystoscopy and the longest being vaginal cuff closure. Time pressure and device absence or malfunction occurred in 48% of the cases, and a median of 262 (IQR: 228-304) auditory distractions were noted per case. There was a median of 3 (IQR: 2-4) safety threats identified per case and at least one error was identified in 11/25 cases (44%). Only two adverse events were noted among all 25 cases. Observed non-technical skills were mainly positive, and observations were the highest for situational awareness and leadership among the surgical team and communication and teamwork among the nursing/scrub technician and anesthesia teams. Conclusions This study is a novel application of the ORBB in the gynecology operating room to capture information regarding procedure times, intraoperative distractions, errors, and non-technical skills of the team.

The present investigation is an attempt to evaluate the safety profile of the first indigenously developed recombinant DNA anti-rabies vaccine [DRV (100 g)] and combination rabies vaccine [CRV (100 g DRV and 1.25 IU of cell culture-derived inactivated rabies virus vaccine)], which are intended for clinical use by intramuscular route in Rhesus monkeys. METHODS: As per the regulatory requirements, the study was designed for acute (single dose - 14 days), sub-chronic (repeat dose - 28 days) and chronic (intended clinical dose - 120 days) toxicity tests using three dose levels, viz. therapeutic, average (2x therapeutic dose) and highest dose (10 x therapeutic dose) exposure in monkeys. The selection of the model i.e. monkey was based on affinity and rapid higher antibody response during the efficacy studies. An attempt was made to evaluate all parameters which included physical, physiological, clinical, haematological and histopathological profiles of all target organs, as well as Tiers I, II, III immunotoxicity parameters. RESULTS: In acute toxicity there was no mortality in spite of exposing the monkeys to 10XDRV. In sub chronic and chronic toxicity studies there were no abnormalities in physical, physiological, neurological, clinical parameters, after administration of test compound in intended and 10 times of clinical dosage schedule of DRV and CRV under the experimental conditions. Clinical chemistry, haematology, organ weights and histopathology studies were essentially unremarkable except the presence of residual DNA in femtogram level at site of injection in animal which received 10X DRV in chronic toxicity study.

This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey study (COVID-19 Parental Attitude Study) of parents of children 12 years and younger presenting to 12 pediatric emergency departments (EDs). Parental reports of willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 when vaccines for children will be approved was correlated to country-specific rate of vaccination during December 2020-March 2021, obtained from ourworldindata.org. Logistic regression models were fit with covariates for week and the corresponding vaccine rate. A total of 720 surveys were analyzed. In Canada, administering mostly first dose to the adult population, willingness to vaccinate children was trending downward (correlation = -0.28), in the United States, it was trending upwards (correlation = 0.21) and in Israel, initially significant increase with decline shortly thereafter (correlation = 0.06).

The expanded workload included tests from anticipated COVID patients in 2 local hospitals and a proposed field hospital with a COVID-specific test menu in addition to the pre-pandemic workload. RESULTS: Instrumentation throughput and turn-around time at each site was predicted. With additional COVID-patient beds in each hospital, the maximum throughput was approached with no impact on turnaround time. Addition of the field hospital workload led to significantly increased test turnaround times at each site.

Methods: This was an observational, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study, carried out between 7 April and 15 June 2020. Responds came from many countries, and the participation was voluntary. The survey contained 40 questions, which evaluated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the endoscopy units and assessed the infection control. Results: A total of 312 questionnaires were filled, 120 from Hungary, and 192 internationally, and 54 questionnaires (17.3%) were sent from high-risk countries;84.9% of the gastroenterologists declared that they read the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) statement, while only 32.1% participated in any advanced training at their workplace. Overall, 92.1% of gastroenterologists realized risk stratification, and 72.1% claimed to have enough protective equipment. In 52.6% of the endoscopy units, at least one endoscopist had to discontinue the work due to any risk factor, while 40.6% reported that the reduced staff did not affect the workflow. Gastroenterologists considered that the five most important examinations both in low and high-risk patients are the following: lower/upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with hemodynamic instability, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in obstructive jaundice, foreign body in the esophagus, ERCP in acute biliary pancreatitis, and iron deficiency anemia with hemodynamic instability, which correlates well with the ESGE recommendation. Significant correlation was found in the usage of the necessary protective equipment in high-risk patients depending on the countries (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The survey found weak correlation in preliminary training depending on countries;nevertheless, in Hungary during the examined period, endoscopists considered the recommendations more strictly than in other countries. Although many physicians left the endoscopy lab, the workflow was not affected, probably due to the reduced number of examinations.

Face masks were found on beaches across the country with average densities of 0.006  0.002 (mean  se) face masks m?2, which are higher than densities reported on Peruvian beaches, but lower than those on some Kenyan beaches. Face masks were also found on more remote beaches and rocky shores in northern-central Chile. Daily accumulation rates on one tourist beach were low during austral fall/winter (0.2 face masks km?1 d?1), but were over ten times higher during austral summer (3.0 face masks km?1 d?1). These values are substantially higher than daily accumulation rates reported from urban streets, which is most likely due to the high densities of beach visitors during the summer tourist season. COVID-19 related infrastructure (signposts and PPE waste bins) was present on most beaches, but while signposts about personal protection were abundant, there were few signposts about littering, and only one of the 12 beaches sampled for COVID infrastructure had a signpost that offered recommendations about the proper disposal of used face masks. Specific waste bins for PPE waste were only available at three beaches. Based on these findings it is recommended to provide sufficient PPE-related signs and waste bins, establish general and strict waste disposal regulations, and to improve enforcement.

Follow-up was performed until May 10th. Patients were assigned to two groups according to two endpoints: venous thromboembolism (VTE) or no VTE. For statistical analysis, univariate logistic regression models were calculated. RESULTS: This study includes 50 patients. In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), pulmonary embolism was detected at contrast-enhanced chest CT. The majority of PE was detected on CTs performed on day 11C20 after symptom onset. Two patients (14%) with PE simultaneously had evidence of deep vein thrombosis. 15 patients (30%) had a negative outcome (need for intensive care, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or death), and 35 patients (70%) had a positive outcome (transfer to regular ward, or discharge). Patients suffering VTE had a statistically significant higher risk of an unfavorable outcome (p = 0.028). In univariate analysis, two imaging characteristics on chest CT were associated with VTE: crazy paving pattern (p = 0.024) and air bronchogram (n = 0.021). Also, elevated levels of NT-pro BNP (p = 0.043), CK (p = 0.023) and D-dimers (p = 0.035) were significantly correlated with VTE. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia is frequently complicated by pulmonary embolism (incidence of 28% in our cohort), remarkably with lacking evidence of deep vein thrombosis in nearly all thus affected patients of our cohort. As patients suffering VTE had an adverse outcome, we call for a high level of alertness for PE and advocate a lower threshold for contrast-enhanced CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. According to our observations, this might be particularly justified in the second week of disease and if a crazy paving pattern and / or air bronchogram is present on previous non-enhanced CT.","output":"Computed tomography characterization and outcome evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by venous thromboembolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a practical nomogram to predict the occurrence of post-traumatic hydrocephalus in patients who have undergone decompressive craniectomy for traumatic brain injury. METHODS: A total of 516 cases were enrolled and divided into the training (n=364) and validation (n=152) cohorts. Optimal predictors were selected through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis of the training cohort then used to develop a nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis, respectively, were used to evaluate the discrimination, fitting performance, and clinical utility of the resulting nomogram in the validation cohort. RESULTS: Preoperative subarachnoid hemorrhage Fisher grade, type of decompressive craniectomy, transcalvarial herniation volume, subdural hygroma, and functional outcome were all identified as predictors and included in the predicting model. The nomogram exhibited good discrimination in the validation cohort and had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95%CI 0.72-0.88). The calibration plot demonstrated goodness-of-fit between the nomogram's prediction and actual observation in the validation cohort. Finally, decision curve analysis indicated significant clinical adaptability. CONCLUSION: The present study developed and validated a model to predict post-traumatic hydrocephalus. The nomogram that had good discrimination, calibration, and clinical practicality can be useful for screening patients at a high risk of post-traumatic hydrocephalus. The nomogram can also be used in clinical practice to develop better therapeutic strategies.","output":"Nomogram for predicting post-traumatic hydrocephalus after decompressive craniectomy for traumatic brain injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) has resulted in a drastic alteration to billions of individuals emotional, physical, mental, social, and financial status. As of July 21(st), 2020, there had been 14.35 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 0.60 million deaths in 216 countries. Design and Methods: The study explores health and wellbeing in universities within the G20 countries (19 member countries and the European Union) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample selection of these countries was considered since it serves around 80% of the worlds economic output, two-thirds of the global population (including more than half of the worlds poor), and 75% of international trade. Specifically, due to this public health concern, schools nationwide closures are impacting over 60% of the worlds student population to promote their quality of life and well-being. Results: This study investigates the G20 policies and procedures within higher education regarding health and well-being measures during the COVID-19 epidemic. The findings reveal that the lockdown, social distancing, and self-isolation requirements are stressful and detrimental for many individuals and have caused students health and well-being concerns. Conclusions: Several countries within the G20 have taken significant steps to support health and well-being issues for university students; however, numerous countries are far behind in addressing this issue. Hence, government leaders of G20 countries, policymakers, and health providers should promptly take the necessary measures to regulate the outbreak, improve safety measures to decrease disease transmission, and administer those who demand medical attention.","output":"Mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in higher education: Evidence from G20 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is on its way to teach us that no one is safe until all are safe.

However, meaning in life is a complex construct involving three distinct facets: coherence, purpose, and mattering. While these facets have been studied individually in relation to pain, they have not been assessed concurrently to parse out their potential distinct contributions to pain outcomes. We sought to identify the unique relationships of these individual facets of meaning with pain experiences and specify the components associated with pain-related resilience. METHODS: The associations of coherence, purpose, and mattering with pain outcomes were examined across three studies. Study 1 used data from the Midlife in the United States National Survey to determine associations between facets and the frequency of various recently experienced pains, and the development of chronic pain nine years later. Study 2 cross-sectionally observed the association between facets and recent pain severity in young adults. Using a diary-type approach, Study 3 captured fluctuations of pain severity in relation to the facets across the span of four weeks. RESULTS: Coherence was uniquely associated with less headache, backache, joint, and extremities pain frequency in Study 1, over and above purpose and mattering, controlling for other health variables. Coherence was also associated with lower odds of developing chronic pain. In Study 2, coherence was associated with less pain severity and fully mediated the relationship between global meaning in life and pain. Study 3 found that coherence predicted the most unique variance in weekly pain fluctuations. CONCLUSION: Across three studies and timescales, coherence was uniquely associated with fewer and less severe pain experiences over and above purpose and mattering. These findings provide support for the value of coherence as a resilience factor in the context of pain and suggest a potential benefit for coherence-specific interventions in clinical settings.","output":"Meaning in Life and Pain: The Differential Effects of Coherence, Purpose, and Mattering on Pain Severity, Frequency, and the Development of Chronic Pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare safety is the product of many interrelated parts of the health system that change over time, so efforts to improve safety also need to evolve and modernise to pre-empt emerging risks.

Continuing to reduce harm and save lives requires taking a closer look at digital technologies, both in the risks they present and the solutions they offer. The priorities for digital clinical safety can be considered in two parts: first, the intrinsic safety of technologies, and second, the extrinsic ability of technologies to drive safety. Embracing these two components requires digital clinical safety to become part of the healthcare culture, with everyone understanding their role in digital clinical safety. It must include processes being easy to follow with clear, accessible guidance, accompanied by targeted standards.

However, it is not known whether the same is true for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) who are on immunosuppressants. MethodsWe identified 30 patients with AIRD who took a single dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine post-COVID-19 infection. Age, sex and disease similar patients were enrolled in to three groups of 30 each who had (1) past infection with COVID-19 but no vaccine, (2) a single dose of ChAdOx1 and (3) double doses of ChAdOx1. Sera were collected from each patient approximately 30 days after last vaccine dose or since the onset of COVID19 symptoms (in the unvaccinated group). Antibodies to spike protein were estimated and virus neutralization potential of sera was tested. ResultsBaseline characteristics including drug usage was similar betweenthe groups. Seroconversion occurred in 25(83%), 23(77%), 27(90%), and 30(100%) in natural infection, single-dose vaccine, double dose vaccine, and infection +single dose vaccine groups respectively. Mean antibody titres (10076.8{+/-}8998) in the last group were at least 6-100x higher than in the other 3 groups. Also, the infection +vaccine group had the highest neutralization potential of 83.37 % as compared to 45.4% in the fully vaccinated group. ConclusionThe hybrid immunity with a single dose of the vector-based vaccine post-infection seems to be superior to double dosage of the vaccine in patients with AIRD. A universal vaccination strategy involving a single dose of vaccine for all individuals with previous COVID-19 infection seems to be effective in these patients also. What is already known about this subject?A single dose of an RNA based COVID-19 vaccine after COVID-19 natural infection provides superior immune protection as compared to double doses of vaccines in infection naive persons A second dose of vaccine in healthy people who had infection previously does not increase the immune protection but may paradoxically induce tolerance Vaccine responses in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases(AIRD) may be suboptimal due to underlying disease or the use of immunosuppressants. What does this study add?Hybrid-induced immunity (single vaccine post COVID-19 infection) produces adequate vaccine responses in patients with AIRD, non-inferior to double dose of vaccine Besides mRNA vaccines, the adenoviral vector vaccine AZD1222 also demonstrates this hybrid phenomenon. How might this impact on clinical practice?Vaccination policies can consider providing only a single vaccine in those who had previous COVID-19 infection. This strategy has been shown not to be harmful for patients with AIRD. This will help reduce vaccine shortages.","output":"Hybrid immunity versus vaccine-induced immunity against SARS CoV2 in Patients with Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various observers have emphasized a recalibration of Indias stance towards the Middle East under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Others have interpreted Modis successive visits to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, and Oman as indicators of a new outreach to all relevant actors in the region. However, has this diplomatic balancing among regional stakeholders signalled a substantial foreign policy change? Can this apparent policy shift be attributed to the personal preferences of Modi?

Can such age-related differences be observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, or would young adults higher levels of COVID-19-related stress alter the relation between age and prosociality given the prior findings that stress may promote prosocial behaviors? Can empathy, one of the factors highly related to prosociality, explain any observed age-related differences? The current study examined the above questions, as well as whether age differences exist in target of prosocial behaviors (i.e., distant- versus close-others). To this end, participants (aged 18-89) enrolled in an ongoing study examining their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were asked to complete a series of surveys on dispositional empathy and prosocial behaviors during the pandemic. In the present analyses, the data were used from 330 participants from the USA who completed all of the surveys. Compared to younger adults, results indicate that older adults showed greater prosocial behaviors during the pandemic despite their higher risk of physical-health complications from COVID-19. Unexpectedly, empathy did not explain such age-related increases in prosocial behaviors even though it was positively related to individuals prosociality. Interestingly, older adults reported increased prosocial behaviors towards close-others (i.e., family, friends) compared to young adults, suggesting that older adults seem to devote more resources into emotionally meaningful relationships.

Lockdowns have led to changes in lifestyle, emotional health, and eating habits. We aimed to evaluate the association of differences in dietary behaviours and lifestyle with self-reported weight gain during the COVID-19 lockdown in Chile. In this cross-sectional analytical study, five previously validated surveys were condensed into a single 86-item online questionnaire. The survey was sent to 1000 potential participants of the university community; it was kept online for 28 days to be answered. Of the 639 respondents, the mean self-reported weight gain during confinement was 1.99 kg (standard deviation [SE]: 0.17) and 0.7 (SE: 0.06) units of body mass index (BMI) (both p < 0.001) and the median difference in body weight during lockdown was 3.3% (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.0C6.7). The differences of intake of most food groups before and during lockdown were associated with greater self-reported weight, BMI and percentage weight gain.

LPAIV infections are usually asymptomatic or cause subclinical symptoms. However, the genetic reassortment of LPAIVs may generate novel viruses with increased virulence and cross-species transmission, posing potential risks to public health. To evaluate the epidemic potential and infection landscape of LPAIVs in Guangxi Province, China, we collected and analyzed throat and cloacal swab samples from chickens, ducks and geese from the live poultry markets on a regular basis from 2016 to 2019. Among the 7,567 samples, 974 (12.87%) were LPAIVs-positive, with 890 single and 84 mixed infections. Higher yearly isolation rates were observed in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, geese had the highest isolation rate, followed by ducks and chickens. Seasonally, spring had the highest isolation rate. Subtype H3, H4, H6 and H9 viruses were detected over prolonged periods, while H1 and H11 viruses were detected transiently. The predominant subtypes in chickens, ducks and geese were H9, H3, and H6, respectively. The 84 mixed infection samples contained 22 combinations. Most mixed infections involved two subtypes, with H3 + H4 as the most common combination. Our study provides important epidemiological data regarding the isolation rates, distributions of prevalent subtypes and mixed infections of LPAIVs.

Setting and participants: Adults registered with an NHS general practice in England or Wales and alive on January 1st 2020. Exposures: Time since diagnosis of COVID-19 (categorised as 0-6 days, 1-2 weeks, 3-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-26 and 27-49 weeks since diagnosis), with and without hospitalisation within 28 days of diagnosis. Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were arterial thromboses (mainly acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke) and venous thromboembolic events (VTE, mainly pulmonary embolism and lower limb deep vein thrombosis). We also studied other vascular events (transient ischaemic attack, haemorrhagic stroke, heart failure and angina). Hazard ratios were adjusted for demographic characteristics, previous disease diagnoses, comorbidities and medications. Results: Among 48 million adults, 130,930 were and 1,315,471 were not hospitalised within 28 days of COVID-19. In England, there were 259,742 first arterial thromboses and 60,066 first VTE during 41.6 million person-years follow-up. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for first arterial thrombosis compared with no COVID-19 declined rapidly from 21.7 (95% CI 21.0-22.4) to 3.87 (3.58-4.19) in weeks 1 and 2 after COVID-19, 2.80 (2.61-3.01) during weeks 3-4 then to 1.34 (1.21-1.48) during weeks 27-49. aHRs for first VTE declined from 33.2 (31.3-35.2) and 8.52 (7.59-9.58) in weeks 1 and 2 to 7.95 (7.28-8.68) and 4.26 (3.86-4.69) during weeks 3-4 and 5-8, then 2.20 (1.99-2.44) and 1.80 (1.50-2.17) during weeks 13-26 and 27-49 respectively. aHRs were higher, for longer after diagnosis, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. aHRs were also higher among people of Black and Asian than White ethnicity and among people without than with a previous event.

The diagnostic criteria involve clinical, laboratory, and complementary tests. This review aims to draw pediatrician attention to this diagnosis, suggesting early treatment strategies, and proposing a pediatric emergency care flowchart. SOURCES: The PubMed/MEDLINE/WHO COVID-19 databases were reviewed for original and review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case series, and recommendations from medical societies and health organizations published through July 3, 2020. The reference lists of the selected articles were manually searched to identify any additional articles. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: COVID-19 infection is less severe in children than in adults, but can present as MIS-C, even in patients without comorbidities. There is evidence of an exacerbated inflammatory response with potential systemic injury, and it may present with aspects similar to those of Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. MIS-C can develop weeks after COVID-19 infection, suggesting an immunomediated cause. The most frequent clinical manifestations include fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, mucous membrane changes, and cardiac dysfunction. Elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and coagulopathy are common laboratory findings. Supportive treatment and early immunomodulation can control the intense inflammatory response and reduce complications and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is serious, rare, and potentially fatal. The emergency department pediatrician must recognize and treat it early using immunomodulatory strategies to reduce systemic injury. Further studies are needed to identify the disease pathogenesis and establish the most appropriate treatment.","output":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 from the pediatric emergency physician's point of view()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schools were largely closed in 2020-2021 to counter COVID-19 spread, impacting students' education and well-being. With highly contagious variants expanding in Europe while vaccine hesitancy persists, safe options to maintain schools open are urgently needed. We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in school. We used empirical contact data measured in a primary and a secondary school in France, and field estimates for adherence to screening from 683 schools during the spring 2021 wave. Examining different screening protocols, we performed a cost-benefit analysis for varying epidemic conditions and vaccination scenarios. In a partially immunized school population, weekly screening would reduce the number of cases on average by 24% in the primary and 53% in the secondary school compared to symptom-based testing alone, if R=1.3 and 50% adhered to screening. This adherence was met in primary schools (53% (95% confidence interval 21-85%)), but insufficient participation was recorded in secondary schools (10% (1-38%) in middle schools, 6% (2-12%) in high schools). Regular screening would also reduce by 90% the number of student-days lost compared to reactive class closure. No difference was predicted when fully vaccinating teachers, due to their limited number and mixing. Partially vaccinating adolescents would still require regular screening for additional control (20% case reduction with 50% vaccinated students).

By adopting the steps and other components of organizational learning, healthcare institutions can convert themselves into learning organizations and ultimately strengthen the overall healthcare system of the country. The present study aimed to examine the influence of several organizational learning dimensions on organization culture in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: During COVID-19 crisis in 2020, an online cross-sectional study was performed. Data were collected via official emails sent to 1500 healthcare professionals working in front line at four sets of hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Basic descriptive analysis was constructed to identify the variation between the four healthcare organizations. A multiple regression was employed to explore how hospitals can adopt learning process during pandemics, incorporating several Dimensions of Learning Organizations Questionnaire (DLOQ) developed by Marsick and Watkins (2003) and Leufvn and others (2015). RESULTS: Organizational learning including system connections (M = 3.745), embedded systems (M = 3.732), and team work and collaborations (M = 3.724) tended to have major significant relationships with building effective learning organization culture. Staff empowerment, dialogues and inquiry, internal learning culture, and continuous learning had the lowest effect on building health organization culture (M = 3.680, M = 3.3.679, M = 3.673, M = 3.663, respectively). A multiple linear regression was run to predict learning organization based on the several variables. These variables statistically significantly predicted learning organization, F (6, 1124) = 168.730, p < .0005, R2 = 0.471, (p < .05). DISCUSSION: The findings concluded that although intrinsic factors like staff empowerment, dialogues and inquiry, and internal learning culture, revealed central roles, still the most crucial factors toward the development of learning organization culture were extrinsic ones including connections, embed system and collaborations. CONCLUSIONS: Until knowledge-sharing is embedded in health organizational systems; organizations may not maintain a high level of learning during crisis.","output":"Building learning organizational culture during COVID-19 outbreak: a national study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Lung ultrasonographic (LUS) imaging may play an important role in the management of patients with COVID-19-associated lung injury, particularly in some special populations. However, data regarding the prognostic role of the LUS in nursing home residents, one of the populations most affected by COVID-19, are not still available. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents affected by COVID-19 were followed up with an LUS from April 8 to May 14, 2020, in Chioggia, Venice. METHODS: COVID-19 was diagnosed through a nasopharyngeal swab. LUS results were scored using a 12-zone method. For each of the 12 zones (2 posterior, 2 anterior, 2 lateral, for both left and right lungs), the possible score ranged from 0 to 3 (1 = presence of B lines, separated, with <50% of space from the pleural line; 2 = presence of B lines, separated, with >50% of space from the pleural line; 3 = lung thickening with tissuelike aspect). The total score ranged from 0 to 36. Mortality was assessed using administrative data. Data regarding accuracy (and related parameters) were reported. RESULTS: Among 175 nursing home residents, 48 (mean age: 84.1 years; mainly female) were affected by COVID-19. Twelve died during the follow-up period. The mean LUS score was 3. The area under the curve of LUS in predicting mortality was 0.603 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.419-0.787], and it increased to 0.725 (95% CI: 0.41-0.99) after including follow-up LUS controls. Taking an LUS score &#8805;4 as exposure variable and mortality as outcome, the sensitivity was 58.33% and specificity 63.89%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 1.62 and a negative of 0.65. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: LUS is able to significantly predict mortality in nursing home residents affected by COVID-19, suggesting that this simple tool can be routinely used in this setting instead of more invasive techniques available only in hospital.","output":"Prognostic Value of Lung Ultrasonography in Older Nursing Home Residents Affected by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Solidarity trial among COVID-19 inpatients has previously reported interim mortality analyses for four repurposed antiviral drugs. Lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon (IFN)-1a were discontinued for futility but randomisation to remdesivir continued. Here, we report the final results of Solidarity and meta-analyses of mortality in all relevant trials to date. METHODS: Solidarity enrolled consenting adults (aged 18 years) recently hospitalised with, in the view of their doctor, definite COVID-19 and no contraindication to any of the study drugs, regardless of any other patient characteristics. Participants were randomly allocated, in equal proportions between the locally available options, to receive whichever of the four study drugs (lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, IFN-1a, or remdesivir) were locally available at that time or no study drug (controls). All patients also received the local standard of care. No placebos were given. The protocol-specified primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, subdivided by disease severity. Secondary endpoints were progression to ventilation if not already ventilated, and time-to-discharge from hospital. Final log-rank and Kaplan-Meier analyses are presented for remdesivir, and are appended for all four study drugs. Meta-analyses give weighted averages of the mortality findings in this and all other randomised trials of these drugs among hospital inpatients. Solidarity is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN83971151, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04315948. FINDINGS: Between March 22, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021, 14 304 potentially eligible patients were recruited from 454 hospitals in 35 countries in all six WHO regions. After the exclusion of 83 (06%) patients with a refuted COVID-19 diagnosis or encrypted consent not entered into the database, Solidarity enrolled 14 221 patients, including 8275 randomly allocated (1:1) either to remdesivir (ten daily infusions, unless discharged earlier) or to its control (allocated no study drug although remdesivir was locally available). Compliance was high in both groups. Overall, 602 (145%) of 4146 patients assigned to remdesivir died versus 643 (156%) of 4129 assigned to control (mortality rate ratio [RR] 091 [95% CI 082C102], p=012). Of those already ventilated, 151 (421%) of 359 assigned to remdesivir died versus 134 (386%) of 347 assigned to control (RR 113 [089C142], p=032). Of those not ventilated but on oxygen, 146% assigned to remdesivir died versus 163% assigned to control (RR 087 [076C099], p=003). Of 1730 not on oxygen initially, 29% assigned to remdesivir died versus 38% assigned to control (RR 076 [046C128], p=030). Combining all those not ventilated initially, 119% assigned to remdesivir died versus 135% assigned to control (RR 086 [076C098], p=002) and 141% versus 157% progressed to ventilation (RR 088 [077C100], p=004). The non-prespecified composite outcome of death or progression to ventilation occurred in 196% assigned to remdesivir versus 225% assigned to control (RR 084 [075C093], p=0001). Allocation to daily remdesivir infusions (vs open-label control) delayed discharge by about 1 day during the 10-day treatment period. A meta-analysis of mortality in all randomised trials of remdesivir versus no remdesivir yielded similar findings. INTERPRETATION: Remdesivir has no significant effect on patients with COVID-19 who are already being ventilated. Among other hospitalised patients, it has a small effect against death or progression to ventilation (or both).

In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers. DESIGN: Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be to be detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo, Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak. RESULTS: The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 161% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detecting anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in Antananarivo. CONCLUSIONS: Given current age-specific estimates of the COVID-19 fatality ratio and the age structure of the population in Antananarivo, we estimate that as few as 11 deaths per week in the 60-70 years age group (corresponding to an infection rate of approximately 1%) would detectably exceed the baseline.

Students reported increases in sleep, social media use, gaming, and procrastination, but decreases in academic motivation and self-regulation (e.g., focusing, juggling responsibilities). Over 75% reported increases in stress, which they attributed most frequently to motivational and academic challenges. Students reported learning less in most of their classes following the shift. They attributed this to internal factors, including self-regulatory/motivational difficulties, and external factors, such as instructional delivery modality. Although most perceived their instructors as understanding, nearly half reported a decline in instructional quality and communication after the shift to remote instruction.

As a counterregulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS and acute lung injury. The affinity of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 with human ACE2 (hACE2) largely determines the degree of clinical symptoms after infection by SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have revealed that regulating the ACE2/RAS system was effective in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-induced ARDS and acute lung injury. Since ACE2 is the host cell receptor of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, regulating the ACE2/RAS system may alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.

Even if more advanced spectrophotometric measurements and classical variants of absorption (FAAS) or emission (ICP-AES/ ICP-OES) spectrometry techniques are used, it is necessary at first to isolate various forms of phosphorus from the matrix, and then to mineralize them prior the determination.

We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurotrauma presentations in the first 3 months after shutdown throughout Pennsylvania. METHODS: The Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation was queried for registry data from the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study between March 12 and June 5 in each year from 2017 to 2020. RESULTS: After the COVID-19 shutdown, there was a 27% reduction in neurotrauma volume, from 2680 cases in 2017 to 2018 cases in 2020, and a 28.8% reduction in traumatic brain injury volume. There was no significant difference in neurotrauma phenotype incurred relative to total cases. Injury mechanism was less likely to be motor vehicle collision and more likely caused by falls, gunshot wound, and recreational vehicle accidents (P < 0.05). Location of injury was less likely on roads and public locations and more likely at indoor private locations (P < 0.05). The proportion of patients with neurotrauma with blood alcohol concentration >0.08 g/dL was reduced in 2020 (11.4% vs. 9.0%; P < 0.05).

Mobility is key to viral spreading and its restriction is the main non-pharmaceutical interventions to fight the virus expansion. Previous works have shown a connection between the structural organization of cities and the movement patterns of their residents. This puts urban centers in the focus of epidemic surveillance and interventions. Here we show that the organization of urban flows has a tremendous impact on disease spreading and on the amenability of different mitigation strategies. By studying anonymous and aggregated intra-urban flows in a variety of cities in the United States and other countries, and a combination of empirical analysis and analytical methods, we demonstrate that the response of cities to epidemic spreading can be roughly classified in two major types according to the overall organization of those flows. Hierarchical cities, where flows are concentrated primarily between mobility hotspots, are particularly vulnerable to the rapid spread of epidemics. Nevertheless, mobility restrictions in such types of cities are very effective in mitigating the spread of a virus. Conversely, in sprawled cities which present many centers of activity, the spread of an epidemic is much slower, but the response to mobility restrictions is much weaker and less effective. Investing resources on early monitoring and prompt ad-hoc interventions in more vulnerable cities may prove helpful in containing and reducing the impact of future pandemics.","output":"Impact of urban structure on infectious disease spreading"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communication is at the heart of leadership and management.

Its collaborative and reflexive process invites stakeholders (e.g. pharmacists and pharmacy support staff) to participate in analysing their everyday work practices as captured on video footage. Through close collaboration with practitioners and attention to their work contexts, VRE may be a useful methodology to engage a time-poor pharmacy workforce in research about themselves, encouraging more practitioner involvement in practice-based research. Aside from research, VRE has also been used effectively as an intervention to facilitate learning and change in healthcare settings, and could be effective in provoking change in otherwise resistant pharmacy environments. Much like traditional ethnographic approaches, VRE researchers have relied on being present 'in the field' to observe, record and make sense of practices with participants. The COVID-19 pandemic however, has introduced restrictions around travel and physical distancing, which has required researchers to contemplate the conduct of VRE 'at a distance', and to imagine new ways in which the methodological 'closeness' to stakeholders and their workplace contexts can be maintained when researchers cannot be on site. In this commentary, we outline the rationale for participatory methods, in the form of VRE, in pharmacy research. We describe the underlying principles of this innovative methodology, and offer examples of how VRE can be used in pharmacy research.

Subsequently, a two-stage filter, first based on protein-ligand docking binding energy value and second based on protein residues in the ligand-binding site and non-covalent interactions between the protein residues and the ligand in the best-docked pose, was used to identify 368 phytochemicals as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13. MD simulations of the top inhibitors complexed with protein were performed to confirm stable binding, and to compute MM-PBSA based binding energy. From among the 368 potential phytochemical inhibitors, the top identified potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13 namely, Picrasidine M, (+)-Epiexcelsin, Isorhoeadine, Euphorbetin and Picrasidine N, can be taken up initially for experimental studies.","output":"Potential phytochemical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13: a molecular docking and dynamic simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accessing the contents of visual short-term memory (VSTM) is compromised by information bottlenecks and visual interference between memorization and recall. Retro-cues, displayed after the offset of a memory stimulus and prior to the onset of a probe stimulus, indicate the test item and improve performance in VSTM tasks. It has been proposed that retro-cues aid recall by transferring information from a high-capacity memory store into visual working memory (multiple-store hypothesis). Alternatively, retro-cues could aid recall by redistributing memory resources within the same (low-capacity) working memory store (single-store hypothesis). If retro-cues provide access to a memory store with a capacity exceeding the set size, then, given sufficient training in the use of the retro-cue, near-ceiling performance should be observed. To test this prediction, 10 observers each performed 12 hours across 8 sessions in a retro-cue change-detection task (40,000+ trials total). The results provided clear support for the single-store hypothesis: retro-cue benefits (difference between a condition with and without retro-cues) emerged after a few hundred trials and then remained constant throughout the testing sessions, consistently improving performance by two items, rather than reaching ceiling performance. Surprisingly, we also observed a general increase in performance throughout the experiment in conditions with and without retro-cues, calling into question the generalizability of change-detection tasks in assessing working memory capacity as a stable trait of an observer (data and materials are available at osf.io/9xr82 and github.com/paulzerr/retrocues).

These viruses show marked species specificity in receptor utilization as they can only use APN of their respective species to initiate virus infection. Feline and canine coronaviruses are also group I coronaviruses. To determine whether feline APN could serve as a receptor for feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), we cloned the cDNA encoding feline APN (fAPN) by PCR from feline cells and stably expressed it in FCoV-resistant mouse or hamster cells. These became susceptible to infection with either of several biotypes of FCoVs. The expression of recombinant fAPN also made hamster and mouse cells susceptible to infection with other group I coronaviruses, including several canine coronavirus strains, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and human coronavirus HCV-229E. Thus, fAPN served as a functional receptor for each of these coronaviruses in group I. As expected, fAPN could not serve as a receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a group II coronavirus which uses murine biliary glycoproteins as receptors. Thus, fAPN acts as a common receptor for coronaviruses in group I, in marked contrast to human and porcine APN glycoproteins which serve as receptors only for human and porcine coronaviruses, respectively. These observations suggest that cats could serve as a \\"mixing vessel\\" in which simultaneous infection with several group I coronaviruses could lead to recombination of viral genomes.","output":"Feline aminopeptidase N is a receptor for all group I coronaviruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively controlled, a large number of patients have been released from isolation and discharged, and the treatment and rehabilitation programs in the recovery period need to be effectively implemented.

We propose the use of a targeting peptide, cardiac homing peptide (CHP), to target intravenously-infused exosomes to the infarcted heart. Methods: Exosomes were conjugated with CHP through a DOPE-NHS linker. Ex vivo targeting was analyzed by incubating organ sections with the CHP exosomes and analyzing with fluorescence microscopy. In vitro assays were performed on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9C2 cells. For the animal study, we utilized an ischemia/reperfusion rat model. Animals were treated with either saline, scramble peptide exosomes, or CHP exosomes 24 h after surgery. Echocardiography was performed 4 h after surgery and 21 d after surgery. At 21 d, animals were sacrificed, and organs were collected for analysis. Results: By conjugating the exosomes with CHP, we demonstrate increased retention of the exosomes within heart sections ex vivo and in vitro with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In vitro studies showed improved viability, reduced apoptosis and increased exosome uptake when using CHP-XOs. Using an animal model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, we measured the heart function, infarct size, cellular proliferation, and angiogenesis, with improved outcomes with the CHP exosomes.

The evidence syntheses are used to derive specific recommendations for clinical practice and to contribute to national guidelines. Besides the necessity of conducting good quality evidence syntheses during a pandemic, just as important is that the dissemination of evidence needs to be quick and efficient, especially in a health crisis. The CEOsys project has set itself this challenge. OBJECTIVE: Preparing the most suitable distribution of evidence syntheses as part of the CEOsys project tasks. METHODS: Intensive care unit (ICU) personnel in Germany were surveyed via categorical and free text questions. The survey focused on the following topics: evidence syntheses, channels and strategies of distribution, possibility of feedback, structure and barriers of dissemination and trustworthiness of various organizations. Profession, qualification, setting and size of the facility were recorded. Questionnaires were pretested throughout the queried professions (physician, nurse, others). The survey was anonymously carried out online through SosciSurvey? and an e?mail was sent directly to 940 addresses. The survey was launched on 3 December, a reminder was sent after 14 days and it ended on 31 December. The survey was also announced via e?mail through DIVI. RESULTS: Of 317 respondents 200 completed the questionnaire. All information was analyzed including the responses from incomplete questionnaires. The most stated barriers were lack of time and access. Especially residents and nurses without specialization in intensive care mentioned uncertainty or insufficient experience in dealing with evidence syntheses as a barrier. Active distribution of evidence syntheses was clearly preferred. More than half of the participants chose websites of public institutions, medical journals, professional societies and e?mail newsletters for drawing attention to new evidence syntheses. Short versions, algorithms and webinars were the most preferred strategies for dissemination. Trust in organizations supplying information on the COVID-19 pandemic was given to professional societies and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) as the German governmental institute for infections and public health. The respondents prioritized topics are long-term consequences of the disease, protection of medical personnel against infection and possibilities of ventilation treatment. CONCLUSION: Even though universally valid, evidence syntheses should be actively brought to the target audience, especially during a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic with its exceptional challenges including lack of time and uncertainties in patient care. The contents should be clear, short (short versions, algorithms) and with free access. E?mail newsletters, websites or medical journals should continuously report on new evidence syntheses.

Total serum protein concentrations confirmed that 72 and 76% of calves had failure of passive transfer (<5.2 g/dL) in HPN and LPN, respectively. All calves were bottle fed twice daily. The LPN were fed 455 g of DM/d of milk replacer (MR) until weaning, and the HPN calves were fed 830 g of DM/d of milk replacer during the first 10 d and 1,080 g from 11 d until weaning. Calf starter and water were offered ad libitum. Calves were step-down weaned beginning at 51 d and completely weaned after 58 d when consuming 1 kg of calf starter (as-fed basis). Data are reported as HPN versus LPN throughout, respectively. Results and Discussion Risk for bloat and scouring were greater for calves fed the HPN, but there was no difference in antibiotic treatment or mortality. The HPN calves had greater performance over the preweaning period including final BW, ADG, and feed:gain (total kg of milk replacer + calf starter, kg of DM/kg of BW gain), but weaning was more stressful for HPN calves. Implications and Applications In conclusion, the high-risk calves fed a HPN had increased preweaning ADG, but there was also an increased incidence of scours. There may be differences in the health status of calves that may affect the ability to consume and use high MR levels. When feeding high-risk calves there may be a need for alternate strategies when determining the quality and quantity of MR being fed when compared with low-risk calves. Differences in gut integrity may influence the ability of high-risk calves to handle high levels of MR early in life. Potential issues with high-risk calves being fed a HPN might be reduced with increased feeding times per day, a gradual step-up method, or other nutritional strategies that improve gastrointestinal development and function.","output":"Effects of plane of milk-replacer nutrition on the health, behavior, and performance of high-risk Holstein bull calves from a commercial calf ranch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: China has made progress in tuberculosis control, but this disease remains a burden in many regions of China. We performed time-series analysis to examine changes in the rates of newly notified and newly smear-positive cases of tuberculosis in different regions of China from 1997 to 2018 and assessed the effect of the current control program. METHODS: National and provincial notification data on tuberculosis from 1997 to 2018, which covers 31 provinces in the mainland of China, were extracted from the Chinese public health science data center. The annual percentage changes in newly notified and smear-positive cases were analyzed using a joinpoint regression method. RESULTS: There were 18 646 672 newly notified tuberculosis cases from 1997 to 2018, with the greatest number in 2005. A total of 6 605 414 of these cases (35.42%) were smear-positive cases. The number of newly notified cases in China overall decreased (96.88C59.27 cases per 100 000) significantly during the most recent years. The decline during this period ranged from ?3.9% (95% CI ?5.7 to ?2.9) in the western region to ?4.3% (95% CI ?4.8 to ?3.7) in the eastern region. Most provinces had significant declines in newly notified and smear-positive cases, whereas the decline of newly smear-positive cases in Xinjiang was about half of that observed during the same period in China overall (?4.1% vs ?9.9%). In addition to disparities in annual percentage changes, the rate of newly notified cases was higher in the western region than in the eastern and central regions. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of tuberculosis has been on declining throughout China during recent years, but tuberculosis in western China continues to be a public health emergency that needs to be urgently addressed.

Given the extent of population aging, the association between frailty and age and the impact of frailty on adverse outcomes for older people, frailty is increasingly being recognized to be a significant public health concern. Early identification of the condition is important to help older adults regain function and to prevent the negative outcomes associated with the syndrome. Despite the importance of diagnosing frailty, there is no definitive evidence or consensus of whether screening should be routinely implemented. A broad range of screening and assessment instruments have been developed taking a biopsychosocial approach, characterizing frailty as a dynamic state resulting from deficits in any of the physical, psychological and social domains, which contribute to health. All these aspects of frailty should be identified and addressed using an integrated and holistic approach to care. To achieve this goal, public health and primary health care (PHC) need to become the fulcrum through which care is offered, not only to older people and those that are frail, but to all individuals, favoring a life-course and patient-centered approach centered around integrated, community-based care. Public health personnel should be trained to address frailty not merely from a clinical perspective, but also in a societal context.

METHOD A total of 207 patients were screened for A118G and randomly received different combinations of propofol and remifentanil, changed depending on the nausea response to endoscopy tube introduction. Nonlinear mixed effects modelling was used to establish the relation between propofol and remifentanil with respect to BIS and to investigate the influence of A118G or noxious stimulation.

Repurposing drugs is a prospective avenue for finding new anti-TB drugs. There are many advantages to discovering novel targets of an existing drug, as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties have already been established, they are cost-efficient and can be commercially accelerated for the new development.

To better understand temporal evolution of COVID-19 related serological and other immune responses during a pandemic, we designed and implemented a baseline cross-sectional study of asymptomatic community volunteers and first responders in metro-Atlanta before the predicted infection peak in 2020. Methods: We recruited healthy community volunteers and first responders for health history, serology, and biobanking. Through an iterative process, we identified one location on our campus and one community location which were accessible, vacant, distant from COVID-19 testing sites, open for social distancing, private for informed consent, and operational for sanitation and ventilation. Research and cleaning supplies were obtained from other researchers and private online vendors due to shortages, and faculty directly participated in consenting and phlebotomy. Results: A total of 369 participants completed the study visits over six full and three half days. Over half of Phase 1 (174/299, 58.2%) and Phase 2 (45/70, 64.3%) self-reported as healthcare workers, and there was a high percentage of participants reporting exposure to known COVID-19 cases (48.2% and 61.4%).

However, past research contains mixed findings on PES ability in contemporary CI users, which at times contrast with anecdotal clinical reports. The present review examined extant PES research to provide an evidence basis for clinical counseling, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest directions for future work in this area of CI outcome assessment. Methods: Six electronic databases were searched using medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords broadly identified to reference CI and environmental sounds. Records published between 2000 and 2021 were screened by two independent reviewers in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. Data were subsequently extracted and evaluated according to synthesis without-meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines. Results: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most examined PES in post-lingually implanted adults, with one study focused on pre/perilingual adults. Environmental sound identification (ESI) in quiet using open- or closed-set response format was most commonly used in PES assessment, included in all selected studies. ESI accuracy in CI children (3 studies) and adults (16 studies), was highly variable but generally mediocre (means range: 31-87%). Only two studies evaluated ESI performance prospectively before and after CI, while most studies were cross-sectional. Overall, CI performance was consistently lower than that of normal-hearing peers. No significant differences in identification accuracy were reported between CI candidates and CI users. Environmental sound identification correlated in CI users with measures of speech perception, music and spectro-temporal processing. Conclusion: The findings of this systematic review indicate considerable limitations in the current knowledge of PES in contemporary CI users, especially in pre/perilingual late-implanted adults and children. Although no overall improvement in PES following implantation was found, large individual variability and existing methodological limitations in PES assessment may potentially obscure potential CI benefits for PES. Further research in this ecologically relevant area of assessment is needed to establish a stronger evidence basis, identify CI users with significant deficits, and improve CI users' safety and satisfaction through targeted PES rehabilitation.","output":"Perception of Environmental Sounds in Cochlear Implant Users: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The term DSD (Disorders of Sex development) is issued to define those conditions in whom disharmony exists between chromosomal, hormonal and anatomical sex.

We hypothesized that the higher voltage coag mode would create more unintended thermal tissue injury at the epigastric trocar's incision. METHODS A prospective blinded randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Patients were randomized to have their operation performed with the monopolar instrument set at 30 W on either the coag mode or the blend mode. Immediately at the end of the operation, a biopsy sample of skin was obtained from the lower edge of the epigastric incision (through which the monopolar instrument was inserted) and the umbilical incision (through which the camera/telescope was inserted). The outcomes measured were histologic evidence of thermal injury at the epigastric and umbilical incisions (determined by a blinded pathologist). RESULTS Forty patients were randomized (20 per group). Baseline demographics in the two groups were similar for age, gender, body mass index, preoperative diagnosis, operative time, and blood loss. Unintentional thermal injury was found at 20 % of epigastric incisions and 35 % of umbilical incisions in the total group.

These phase separated molecular sponges, stabilized by quinary (transient and weak) interactions, control proteins involved in numerous biological functions. Retroviruses such as HIV-1 form by self-assembly when their genomic RNA (gRNA) traps Gag and GagPol polyprotein precursors. Infectivity requires extracellular budding of the particle followed by maturation, an ordered processing of ~2400 Gag and ~120 GagPol by viral protease (PR). This leads to a condensed gRNA-NCp7 nucleocapsid and a CAp24-self-assembled capsid surrounding the RNP. The choreography by which all of these components dynamically interact during virus maturation is one of the missing milestones to fully depict the HIV life cycle. Here, we describe how HIV-1 has evolved a dynamic RNP granule with successive weak-strong-moderate quinary NC-gRNA networks during the sequential processing of the GagNC domain. We also reveal two palindromic RNA-binding triads on NC, KxxFxxQ and QxxFxxK, that provide quinary NC-gRNA interactions. Consequently, the nucleocapsid complex appears properly aggregated for capsid reassembly and reverse transcription, mandatory processes for viral infectivity. We show that PR is sequestered within this RNP and drives its maturation/condensation within minutes, this process being most effective at the end of budding. We anticipate such findings will stimulate further investigations of quinary interactions and emergent mechanisms in crowded environments throughout the wide and growing array of RNP granules.","output":"The HIV-1 ribonucleoprotein dynamically regulates its condensate behavior and drives acceleration of protease activity through membraneless granular phase separation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The intracellular RNA of two neurotropic variants of the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) independently isolated from the brain and spinal cord of an infected Wistar Furth rat were compared with that of the parental virus.

The possible sequence changes were studied by oligonucleotide fingerprinting and direct RNA sequencing. Both variants have a large deletion of 246 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal end of the HE protein. However, this truncated protein was not detected in the infected cells, suggesting either a translational regulation or rapid degradation of the truncated protein in these cells. The variant virus isolated from the spinal cord has a second deletion of 147 amino acids in the amino-terminal half of the S protein. This deletion site corresponds to a hypervariable region where deletions have been frequently noted among MHV variants with different biological properties.

According to Huo et. al, nanobodies are a new and promising treatment that may be the future of preventing COVID-19 and other pathogens. Nanobodies are a monomeric protein consisting solely of heavy chain amino acids with only one chain in its Receptor Binding Domain(RBD), in contrast to the antibody that consists of two heavy and two light chains in its RBD. The structural difference affects antibodies' and nanobodies' function in reference to the binding to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike, and their structural difference allows for a comprehensive treatment against COVID-19 by providing unique opportunities in their application. Our research and 3-D modeling using jMol suggests that while nanobodies are much smaller in size, they have more ridges and bends which creates more overall surface area for hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds take place mainly on alanine and arginine side chains. This means nanobodies satisfy more hydrogen bonds with the spike protein, and therefore have a stronger and more consistent binding affinity to COVID-19. In comparison, antibodies have a smoother surface, with less bends and folds, that allows for less space for hydrogen bonds, creating, while still effective, a less consistent and weaker binding affinity to the COVID-19 spike.

Other potential risk factors include lack of exposure to sunlight, darker skin pigmentation, co-morbidities, poor diet, certain medications, disadvantaged social and economic status, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol. A key question is to understand how and why certain groups of people are more susceptible to COVID-19, whether they have weakened immune systems and what the roles of good nutrition and specific micronutrients are in supporting immune functions. A varied and balanced diet with an abundance of fruits and vegetables and the essential nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin A, B vitamins (folate, vitamin B(6) and vitamin B(12)), vitamin C and the minerals, Fe, Cu, Se and Zn are all known to contribute to the normal functions of the immune system. Avoidance of deficiencies and identification of suboptimal intakes of these micronutrients in targeted groups of patients and in distinct and highly sensitive populations could help to strengthen the resilience of people to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to highlight evidence-based public health messages, to prevent false and misleading claims about the benefits of foods and food supplements and to communicate clearly that the extent of knowledge between micronutrients and COVID-19 infection is still being explored and that no diet will prevent or cure COVID-19 infection.

Vitamin A deficiency in K14E7HPV expressing transgenic mice facilitates the formation of malignant cervical lesions. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer (CC), but viral infection alone does not guarantee the development of this malignancy. Indeed, deficiencies of dietary micronutrients could favor cervical cancer development in individuals that harbor HR-HPV infections. The status of retinoid levels, natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, is important in maintaining cellular differentiation of the cervical epithelium. Moreover, many studies show a link between deficient intake of retinoids or alteration of the retinoid receptors and CC development. In spite of this, the effect of Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in presence of HR-HPV oncoproteins on cervical carcinogenesis in vivo has not been reported. Transgenic mice expressing E6 or E7 oncoproteins (K14E6 or K14E7 mice, respectively) were used to evaluate the possible role of VAD in the development of malignant cervical lesions. The survival of the mice in VAD condition was studied and histopathological analysis and immunohistochemical detection of molecular cancer markers such as the tumor suppressor Retinoic Acid Receptor beta (RAR), Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), Cleaved Caspase 3 and the tumor suppressor protein p16INK4A (inhibitor of CDK4) were performed. Our results show that K14E6/VAD mice showed moderate cervical dysplasia; notably, K14E7/VAD mice developed severe cervical dysplasia and cervical in situ carcinoma at an early age.

DESIGN: Systematic review of test accuracy studies. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2010 to 17 May 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies reporting test accuracy of AI algorithms, alone or in combination with radiologists, to detect cancer in womens digital mammograms in screening practice, or in test sets. Reference standard was biopsy with histology or follow-up (for screen negative women). Outcomes included test accuracy and cancer type detected. STUDY SELECTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. A single reviewer extracted data, which were checked by a second reviewer. Narrative data synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Twelve studies totalling 131 822 screened women were included. No prospective studies measuring test accuracy of AI in screening practice were found. Studies were of poor methodological quality. Three retrospective studies compared AI systems with the clinical decisions of the original radiologist, including 79 910 women, of whom 1878 had screen detected cancer or interval cancer within 12 months of screening. Thirty four (94%) of 36 AI systems evaluated in these studies were less accurate than a single radiologist, and all were less accurate than consensus of two or more radiologists. Five smaller studies (1086 women, 520 cancers) at high risk of bias and low generalisability to the clinical context reported that all five evaluated AI systems (as standalone to replace radiologist or as a reader aid) were more accurate than a single radiologist reading a test set in the laboratory. In three studies, AI used for triage screened out 53%, 45%, and 50% of women at low risk but also 10%, 4%, and 0% of cancers detected by radiologists. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence for AI does not yet allow judgement of its accuracy in breast cancer screening programmes, and it is unclear where on the clinical pathway AI might be of most benefit. AI systems are not sufficiently specific to replace radiologist double reading in screening programmes. Promising results in smaller studies are not replicated in larger studies. Prospective studies are required to measure the effect of AI in clinical practice. Such studies will require clear stopping rules to ensure that AI does not reduce programme specificity.

Many strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have distinct, S-dependent organ and tissue tropisms despite using a common receptor, suggesting that they employ different cellular proteases for fusion. In support of this hypothesis, we found that inhibition of endosomal acidification only modestly decreased entry, and overexpression of the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 greatly enhanced entry, of the highly neurovirulent MHV strain JHM.SD relative to their effects on the reference strain, A59. However, TMPRSS2 overexpression decreased MHV structural protein expression, release of infectious particles, and syncytium formation, and endogenous serine protease activity did not contribute greatly to infection. We therefore investigated the importance of other classes of cellular proteases and found that inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)- and a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)-family zinc metalloproteases markedly decreased both entry and cell-cell fusion. Suppression of virus by metalloprotease inhibition varied among tested cell lines and MHV S proteins, suggesting a role for metalloprotease use in strain-dependent tropism. We conclude that zinc metalloproteases must be considered potential contributors to coronavirus fusion.IMPORTANCE The family Coronaviridae includes viruses that cause two emerging diseases of humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as a number of important animal pathogens. Because coronaviruses depend on host protease-mediated cleavage of their S proteins for entry, a number of protease inhibitors have been proposed as antiviral agents. However, it is unclear which proteases mediate in vivo infection. For example, SARS-CoV infection of cultured cells depends on endosomal acid pH-dependent proteases rather than on the cell surface acid pH-independent serine protease TMPRSS2, but Zhou et al. (Antiviral Res 116:76-84, 2015, doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011) found that a serine protease inhibitor was more protective than a cathepsin inhibitor in SARS-CoV-infected mice. This paper explores the contributions of endosomal acidification and various proteases to coronavirus infection and identifies an unexpected class of proteases, the matrix metalloproteinase and ADAM families, as potential targets for anticoronavirus therapy.","output":"Neurovirulent Murine Coronavirus JHM.SD Uses Cellular Zinc Metalloproteases for Virus Entry and Cell-Cell Fusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the relationship between different dimensions of the quality of the political system and the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Previous studies suggested a close association between the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) genetic variant rs12252 and influenza. Here, we explored the correlation between the rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity using meta-analysis. METHODS: Relevant studies published before May 22, 2014 were retrieved from PubMed, ISI web of knowledge, EBSCO, and Cochrane central register of controlled trials databases. Association between rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity were determined using statistical analysis of odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of four studies consisting of 445 cases and 4180 controls were included in our analysis. Generally, there is increased risk of influenza in subjects carrying rs12252 in the recessive model (CC vs. CT+TT: OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.49-3.70, P<0.001), the dominant model (CC+CT vs. TT: OR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.18C2.22, P=0.003), the homozygote comparison (CC vs. TT: OR=4.11, 95% CI: 2.15C7.84, P<0.001), and the allele contrast (C vs. T: OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.32C2.13, P<0.001). Stratification analysis of ethnicity and severity revealed a significant increase in influenza susceptibility by IFITM3-SNP rs12252 among both Asian and Caucasian population. SNP rs12252 shows significant impact on severe infections (P<0.05), but not on mild influenza. Besides, our result also associated rs12252 with influenza severity (severe vs. mild: OR=2.37, 95% CI: 1.32C4.25, P=0.004), (severe vs. control: OR=2.70, 95% CI: 1.85C3.94, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests a significant association between a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) with severe influenza susceptibility, but not in mild influenza subjects, in both UK Caucasians and Han Chinese population. The rs12252-C allele causes a 23.7% higher chance of infection and also constitutes a risk factor for more severe influenza.","output":"Interferon-Inducible Transmembrane Protein 3 Genetic Variant rs12252 and Influenza Susceptibility and Severity: A Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine if tobacco use in patients with Covid-19 is associated with a negative disease course and adverse outcome, and if smoking, current and past, is associated with a greater possibility of developing COVID-19.

We collected and compared the data concerning the number of PWE cared for and epilepsy procedures performed during the 6 months periods preceding and following COVID-19 lockdown from epilepsy centers. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 453 neurologists and 325 PWE. One third of the neurologist reported >50 % decline in outdoor visits by PWE and EEG recordings. The cumulative data from 11 centers showed 65-70 % decline in the number of outdoor patients, video-EEG monitoring, and epilepsy surgery. Working in a hospital admitting COVID-19 patients and use of teleconsultation correlated with this decline. Half of PWE had postponed their planned outpatient visits and EEG.

Semi-quantitative assessment methods, e.g., lobar-, segmental-based CT scores and opacity-weighted score, and quantitative assessment method, i.e., lesion volume quantification, were applied to quantify the lung lesions. All four assessment methods had high inter-rater agreements. At the group level, the lesion load in severe type patients was consistently observed to be significantly higher than that in common type in the applications of four assessment methods (all the p < 0.001). In discriminating severe from common patients at the individual level, results for lobe-based, segment-based and opacity-weighted assessments had high true positives while the quantitative lesion volume had high true negatives.

To evaluate for SARS-CoV-2 in school-aged children and assess household transmission, we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on 670 archived specimens that were collected between September 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 as part of a community-based study. CASE PRESENTATION A single SARS-CoV-2 case was detected in an 11-year-old girl on March 18, 2020, resulting in very low prevalence (0.15% [95% CI, 0.03-0.84]) in this population. This case was associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection in all other household members. Symptoms were reported as mild to moderate. Whole genome sequencing supported household transmission of near-identical viruses within the 19B clade. DISCUSSION This case represents the earliest known household cluster of SARS-CoV2 in Wisconsin. CONCLUSION This case suggests that household transmission associated with school-aged children may have contributed to wide seeding across populations.","output":"Evidence of Early Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Involving a School-aged Child."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary dysmenorrhea (PDM), characterized by cramping pain in the lower abdomen, is a common gynecological disorder in women of child-bearing age. An increasing number of neuroimaging studies have emphasized that PDM is associated with functional and structural abnormalities in the regions related to the default mode network (DMN). Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the aim of this study was to use amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) to investigate changes of the intrinsic brain activity in the DMN in PDM. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to assess relationships between the neuroimaging findings and clinical symptoms. Forty-eight PDM patients and thirty-eight matched healthy controls participated in this study. Compared to healthy controls, PDM patients had increased ALFF in the precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and decreased ALFF in the thalamus. PDM patients also had decreased connectivity between the precuneus and left dmPFC and right ACC, while increased connectivity between the precuneus and left thalamus. In addition, the ALFF in the left dmPFC in PDM patients positively correlated with disease duration. Our findings provide further evidence of the DMN-related abnormalities in PDM patients which might contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease.","output":"Aberrant default mode network in patients with primary dysmenorrhea: a fMRI study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moving between the 2015 elections, Covid-19 and the sustained social justice protests in the United States in this essay, I question where and how the pursuit of joy, remedies for boredom and practices of self-care relate to the necropolitical social hierarchies in the United States.

To better understand the resistant mechanism, we calculated the binding affinities of 26 antibodies to wild-type (WT) spike protein and to the protein harboring E484K mutation, respectively. The results showed that most antibodies (~85%) have weaker binding affinities to the E484K mutated spike protein than to the WT, indicating the high risk of immune evasion of the mutated virus from most of current antibodies. Binding free energy decomposition revealed that the residue E484 forms attraction with most antibodies, while the K484 has repulsion from most antibodies, which should be the main reason of the weaker binding affinities of E484K mutant to most antibodies. Impressively, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) combination was found to have much stronger binding affinity with E484K mutant than WT, which may work well against the mutated virus.

Objectives: To quantify the magnitude of heterogeneity in the wider community (outside of long-term care homes) in Toronto, Canada and assess how the magnitude in concentration evolved over time (January 21 to November 21, 2020). Design: Retrospective, population-based observational study using surveillance data from Ontario's Case and Contact Management system. Setting: Toronto, Canada. Participants: Laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 (N=33,992). Measurements: We generated epidemic curves by SDOH and crude Lorenz curves by neighbourhoods to visualize inequities in the distribution of COVID-19 cases by social determinants of health (SDOH) and estimated the crude Gini coefficient. We examined the correlation between SDOH using Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: The Gini coefficient of cumulative cases by population size was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.36-0.47) and were estimated for: household income (0.20, 95%CI: 0.14-0.28); visible minority (0.21, 95%CI: 0.16-0.28); recent immigration (0.12, 95%CI: 0.09-0.16); suitable housing (0.21, 95%CI: 0.14-0.30); multi-generational households (0.19, 95%CI: 0.15-0.23); and essential workers (0.28, 95% CI: 0.23-0.34). Most SDOH were highly correlated. Locally acquired cases were concentrated in higher income neighbourhoods in the early phase of the epidemic, and then concentrated in lower income neighbourhoods. Mirroring the trajectory of epidemic curves by income, the Lorenz curve shifted over time from below to above the line of equality with a similar pattern across SDOH. Limitations: Study relied on area-based measures of the SDOH and individual case counts of COVID-19. We cannot infer concentration of cases by specific occupational exposures given limitation to broad occupational categories.

The detection of multiple MPVs isolates indicated a need for standardized nomenclature. As with other autonomous parvoviruses, MPVs require cellular factors expressed during cell division and differentiation for productive replication. These factors are thought to account for their predilection for mitotically active cells. The simple structure of rodent parvoviruses has stimulated development of valuable reagents to detect infection. These include generic and serotype-specific antigens for use in serological tests, antibodies to viral proteins for use in immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction primers for detection of viral DNA in infected tissues and feces, and strand-specific molecular probes that help distinguish sites of active viral replication. Because MVM does not persist in immunocompetent mice, control and elimination should employ quarantine for at least 1 month, combined with thorough disinfection of the environment.

Both LUS and CT scores correlated directly with patients age (r=0.586, p<0.001 and r=0.399, p=0.021 respectively) and CRP (r=0.472, p=0.002 and r=0.518, p=0.002 respectively), inversely with PaO2/FiO2 (r=-0.485, p=0.003 and r=-0.440, p=0.017 respectively). LUS score only showed significant correlation with hs-troponin T, NT-pro-BNP, and creatinine (r=0.433, p=0.019; r=0.411, p=0.027, and r=0.497, p=0.001, respectively). Semi-quantitative bedside LUS is related to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia similarly to chest CT. Correlation of LUS score with markers of cardiac and renal injury suggests that LUS might contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation of this heterogeneous population.","output":"Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19: Clinical Correlates and Comparison with Chest Computed Tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synthetic peptide antigens were prepared for use in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect serum antibodies against abortigenic strains of Chlamydia psittaci in livestock. Peptide antigens were identified with C. psittaci B577-immune sera by solid-phase scanning of overlapping octapeptides of variable domains (VDs) of the major outer membrane protein of C. psittaci serovar 1 (omp1 type C. psittaci B577). Two VD 4 regions and one VD 2 region were strongly reactive with all C. psittaci B577 antisera. Peptides encompassing these regions were synthesized with biotin and a serine-glycine-serine-glycine spacer at the N terminus and were attached to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates. In direct ELISAs with these plates, the synthetic peptides reacted with C. psittaci B577 antisera, but not with sera from specific-pathogen-free animals. Serum specimens from 40 sheep and 40 cattle, obtained from herds with abortion problems, were screened for antibodies by these C. psittaci B577 peptide ELISAs and an ELISA with recombinant, genus-specific Chlamydia lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen. Results from these newly developed ELISAs were compared to those from the reference C. psittaci B577 elementary body (EB) ELISA and the Chlamydia complement fixation test (CFT). The C. psittaci B577 peptide ELISAs, the LPS ELISA, and the EB ELISA correctly identified the presence or absence of antibodies against chlamydiae in all sheep and bovine sera. The Chlamydia CFT, which is the most widely accepted serodiagnostic method for chlamydial infections in animals, correctly identified the presence or absence of antibodies against chlamydiae in only 78 and 4.9% of sheep and bovine sera, respectively. These results suggest that the C. psittaci B577-peptide and Chlamydia LPS ELISAs are superior for the serodiagnosis of ruminant infections with abortigenic chlamydiae, since they are more sensitive than the CFT, they are easy to standardize, and they use readily available synthetic antigens instead of organism-derived CFT antigen.","output":"Use of synthetic antigens improves detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of antibodies against abortigenic Chlamydia psittaci in ruminants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A patient's age serves as a very useful guide to physicians in deciding what disease manifestations to anticipate, what treatment to offer for certain conditions, and how to prepare for possible emergencies.

Despite the key role of primary healthcare in rural settings there is limited research on effective models for dementia care, or evidence on sustaining and scaling them. The purpose of this study was to identify factors influencing sustainability and scale-up of rural primary care based memory clinics from the perspective of healthcare providers involved in their design and delivery. METHODS: Participants were members of four interdisciplinary rural memory clinic teams in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. A qualitative cross-sectional and retrospective study design was conducted. Data were collected via 6 focus groups (n = 40) and 16 workgroup meetings held with teams over 1 year post-implementation (n = 100). An inductive thematic analysis was used to identify themes. RESULTS: Eleven themes were identified (five that influenced both sustainability and scale-up, three related to sustainability, and three related to scale-up), encompassing team, organizational, and intervention-based factors. Factors that influenced both sustainability and scale-up were positive outcomes for patients and families, access to well-developed clinic processes and tools, a confident clinic leader-champion, facilitation by local facilitators and the researchers, and organizational and leadership support. Study findings revealed the importance of particular factors in the rural context, including facilitation to support team activities, a proven ready-to-use model, continuity of team members, and mentoring. CONCLUSIONS: Interdisciplinary models of dementia care are feasible in rural settings if the right conditions and supports are maintained.

Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported as frequent but their incidence is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the real incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients admitted to Portuguese hospitals and to understand the underlying prognostic implications. METHODS The Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology (APAPE) conducted a survey in Portuguese hospitals to assess the occurrence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients, their clinical characteristics, the use of experimental therapies and the impact on QT interval. RESULTS Twenty hospitals participated, reporting 692 hospitalized patients. An arrhythmic episode occurred in 81 (11.7%) and 64 (79%) had detailed information on these episodes. New onset arrhythmias occurred in 41 (64%) patients, 45 (70.3%) male, median age 73.5 (61-80.3) years. There were 51 (79.7%) with associated comorbidities, mainly arterial hypertension (41, 64.1%). Of 53 patients (82.3%) on experimental therapy, 7 (10.9%) had an increased QTc interval. Regarding arrhythmias, two patients (3.1%) had ventricular tachycardia, 5 (7.8%) sinus bradycardia, 17 (26.6%) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 40 (62.5%) atrial fibrillation or flutter. At the time of reporting, there had been no deaths due to arrhythmic syndrome or related complications. CONCLUSIONS In a population of COVID-19 patients. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is high but not associated with increased cardiac mortality although it does though occur frequently in extremely ill patients and with multiple organ failure. Regardless of the use of experimental drugs, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is low and atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias are the most prevalent arrythmias.","output":"Cardiac arrhythmias in patients presenting with COVID-19 treated in Portuguese hospitals: A national registry from the Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disasters are widely reported, commonplace events that characteristically leave an enormous legacy of human suffering through death, injury, extensive infrastructural damage, and disorganization to systems and communities.

We sought to identify potential patient-level contraindicators for telegenetic genetic counseling. METHODS: We analyzed post-counseling (pre-result disclosure) follow-up data from a randomized noninferiority trial of a telephone genetic counseling versus usual care genetic counseling. Among 669 randomized participants, 600 completed pre-test counseling and 568 completed a 2-week follow-up assessment before receiving test results. In this analysis, we focused on genetic counseling outcomes (knowledge, decisional conflict, and distress). In multivariate models controlling for bivariate predictors of these outcomes, we tested our a priori hypotheses that pre-counseling numeracy, perceived stress, and race/ethnicity would moderate the outcomes of telephone genetic counseling versus usual care. RESULTS: Only numeracy significantly moderated associations between mode of genetic counseling and outcomes. Higher numeracy was associated with higher post-counseling knowledge following telephone genetic counseling (p < 0.001), but not usual care (p = 0.450). Higher numeracy was also associated with lower distress following telephone genetic counseling (p = 0.009) but not usual care (p = 0.16). Neither perceived stress nor race/ethnicity exhibited differential impacts on telephone genetic counseling versus usual care (ps > 0.20).

MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective observational pilot study. Cerebral and renal regional tissue oxyhemoglobine saturation (rSO2) rSO2 were assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during thoracoscopic surgery in neonates with CDH and with EA, in addition to routine anesthesia monitoring. Cerebral and renal rSO2, linked to repeated arterial blood gas analyses, heart rate, blood pressure, and to structured longitudinal neurodevelopmental follow-up. RESULTS Baseline estimated marginal means of cerebral rSO2 values (CDH: 82%, EA: 91%) did not change significantly during pneumothorax (CDH: 81%, EA 79% [n.s. versus baseline]) despite severe acidosis (lowest pH, CDH: 6.99, EA: 7.1). Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months were normal in all 7 patients who were available for evaluation. CONCLUSION Neonatal thoracoscopic repair of CDH and EA using CO2-pneumothorax leads to severe acidosis.

However, the molecular mechanism of how miRNAs regulate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection remains unclear. In this study, we first constructed a PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cytopathic model to validate the relationship between miR-129a-3p expression levels and PEDV resistance. Secondly, we explored the effect of miR-129a-3p on PEDV infection by targeting the 3UTR region of the ligand ectodysplasin (EDA) gene. Finally, transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the downstream regulatory mechanism of EDA. The results showed that after 48 h of PEDV infection, IPEC-J2 cells showed obvious pathological changes, and miR-129a-3p expression was significantly downregulated (p < 0.01). Overexpression of miR-129a-3p mimics inhibited PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells; silencing endogenous miR-129a-3p can promote viral replication. A dual luciferase assay showed that miR-129a-3p could bind to the 3UTR region of the EDA gene, which significantly reduced the expression level of EDA (p < 0.01). Functional verification showed that upregulation of EDA gene expression significantly promoted PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells. Overexpression of miR-129a-3p can activate the caspase activation and recruitment domain 11 (CARD11) mediated NF-B pathway, thus inhibiting PEDV replication. The above results suggest that miR-129a-3p inhibits PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells by activating the NF-B pathway by binding to the EDA 3UTR region.

Lineage 1 (L1) PRRSV was found to be susceptible to recombination among PRRSVs both in China and the US. The recombinant major parent between the 1991-2013 data and the 2014-2018 data showed a trend from complex to simple. The major recombination pattern changed from an L8 to L1 backbone during 2014-2018 for Chinese PRRSVs, whereas L1 was always the major parent for US PRRSVs. Intra-lineage recombination hotspots were not as concentrated as inter-lineage recombination hotspots. In the two main clades with differential diversity in L1, NADC30-like PRRSVs is undergoing a decrease in population genetic diversity, NADC34-like PRRSVs has been relatively stable in population genetic diversity for years.

Strikingly, we found high frequency of inter-lineage recombination hotspots in non-structural protein 9 (NSP9) and in the GP2-GP3 region. Also, intra-lineage recombination hotspots were scattered across the genome between Chinese and US strains. Furthermore, we proposed novel methods based on NSP2 indel patterns for the classification of PRRSVs.

By means of molecular dynamics simulations, this work addressed the behavior of 2019-nCoV in two aspects: the binding affinity of its receptor binding domain (RBD) with ACE2, and its potential conformation preferences in its unbound state. The results showed that the RBD of 2019-nCov bound much stronger with ACE2 than that of SARS-CoV due to a better organized hydrogen bond network between the former pair with most of the residues at the contact interface sharing the responsibility to hold the pair tightly. This is in contrast to the case of SARS-CoV, which strongly relied on the residues at the ends of the cleft. In its unbound state, the RBD of 2019-nCoV was found to fold part of its receptor binding motif (RBM) into a helical conformation and flip into a concave to minimize its contact with the external environment.

Delayed GE at baseline defined the gastroparesis group. Patients were followed up for a mean of 8.9 years, yielding 13 466 patients per year. Mortality was assessed using the French CepiDc database with data from local civil registries. The cause of death was determined from medical records. Mortality rates were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and hazard ratio (HR) was calculated using the Cox regression model. RESULTS Age and symptoms severity were not different among patients with normal GE (n = 1179) and with delayed GE (n = 384) while diabetes mellitus was more frequent in the gastroparesis group. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed increased mortality in the gastroparesis group compared to patients with normal GE. Cox regression model identified delayed GE as independently associated with increased mortality (HR = 1.63[1.09-2.42]; P = 0.02). Other independent factors associated with increased mortality included age, male sex, and diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to describe the demographic data, etiology, and pulmonary histopathological findings of different diseases in the autopsies of patients with acute respiratory failure. METHOD: Autopsies of 4,710 patients with acute respiratory failure from 1990 to 2008 were reviewed, and the following data were obtained: age, sex, and major associated diseases. The pulmonary histopathology was categorized as diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia. The odds ratio of the concordance between the major associated diseases and specific autopsy findings was calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Bacterial bronchopneumonia was present in 33.9% of the cases and cancer in 28.1%. The pulmonary histopathology showed diffuse alveolar damage in 40.7% (1,917) of the cases. A multivariate analysis showed a significant and powerful association between diffuse alveolar damage and bronchopneumonia, HIV/AIDS, sepsis, and septic shock, between liver cirrhosis and pulmonary embolism, between pulmonary edema and acute myocardial infarction, between dilated cardiomyopathy and cancer, between alveolar hemorrhage and bronchopneumonia and pulmonary embolism, and between lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia and HIV/AIDS and liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchopneumonia was the most common diagnosis in these cases. The most prevalent pulmonary histopathological pattern was diffuse alveolar damage, which was associated with different inflammatory conditions. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the complete pathophysiological mechanisms involved with each disease and the development of acute respiratory failure.","output":"Demographic, etiological, and histological pulmonary analysis of patients with acute respiratory failure: a study of 19 years of autopsies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Israel is currently struggling with the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS CoV-2 Transmission is increasing, with higher morbidity and mortality among populations at risk Over-representation of blood type A was reported in COVID-19 patients with increased respiratory failure, while blood type O seems to have a protective effect This may be caused by interference of anti-A antibodies in viral binding to the ACE receptor, different neutralization antibodies potency or variations in the stability of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers in different blood types Since transfusion of convalescent COVID19 Plasma (CCP) is an accepted therapeutic modality, the Ministry of Health initiated a national project whereby CCP is collected by Magen David Adom (MDA) Blood Services using apheresis procedures and transfusions are approved by an experts committee, as part of the clinical trial or as compassionate treatment Preliminary analysis of 49/170 patients treated so far shows improvement in 49%, with important relations with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies level in the transfused plasma Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 83% of 1100 CCP donors, but a 13% decrease in antibodies level was detected in repeat donations Blood type A was more predominant among CCP donors, when compared to MDA blood donors' data A transfusion of CCP is a feasible and relatively safe therapeutic modality, mainly for patients with moderate COVID 19 CCP also serves as a source for the production of hyperimmune globulin for the treatment of COVID 19 and for passive immunization for populations at risk","output":"[Covid-19 - Blood Groups, Antibodies and Convalescent Plasma]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of antibiotics in the 19th century has significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases. However, irrational use of antibiotics in humans as well as in animals has driven the 21st century to the rapid emergence of MultiDrug Resistance Bacteria (MRB). Moreover, the dissemination of COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for MRB, typically due to increased use of antibiotics to avoid secondary infections. The fast pace progression of bacterial resistance for the antibiotics and their combinations is making the management of MRB infections tough and increasing the cost of the treatment as well. However, use of Efflux Pump Inhibitors (EPI) as adjuvant for antibiotics has shown a ray of hope by retaining the susceptibility of the antibiotics and thereby reducing the burden of immediate requirement of new antibiotics for MRB. Accordingly, the present paper is aimed to scrutinize the predominant literature depicting the plant Phyto-constituents as an EPI and adjuvant for antibiotics in the management of MRB infections. The systematic review of the present paper indicates that the plant phyto-constituents belonging to the class of alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids can effectively be used as EPIs for antibiotics such as Ciprofloxacin, Norfloxacin, Tetracyclines and Chloramphenicol.

A slew of adverse events related to chronic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) treatment have been documented in the past decade. However, the risk of infection with the novel coronavirus in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) using PPI still remains to be elucidated. Aim: To determine the incidence of COVID-19 in GERD patients on chronic PPI treatment. Methods: We reviewed data from a large commercial database (Explorys IBM) that aggregates electronic health records from 26 large nationwide healthcare systems. Using systemized nomenclature of clinical medical terms (SNOMED CT), we identified adults with GERD (November 1999-November 2020) and COVID-19(January 2020 C November 2020). Comorbidities known to be associated with GERD and COVID-19 such as obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), Barretts esophagus (BE), gender, smoking, advance age were also collected. Incidence of COVID-19 was compared among different risk groups. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the strongest association. Results: Out of 61.4 million active adult patients in the database, 6,173,950 patients (9.85%) had documented GERD. In univariate analysis in GERD cohort, there was a higher incidence of COVID-19 in patients who are on PPIs (0.11% vs 0.03 % OR 3.28 [95% CI: 3.03 C 3.55]), females (0.11% vs 0.05%;OR 2.05 [95%CI: 1.94C2.17]), younger than 65 years (0.10% vs 0.07%, OR 1.50 [95%CI: 1.41 - 1.59]) diabetic (0.13% vs 0.07%, OR 1.93 [95%CI: 1.83C2.04]), or have BE (0.32% vs 0.08%, OR 4.00 [95%CI: 3.39C4.72]). Incidence of COVID-19 was also higher among smokers (0.09% vs 0.08%, OR 1.12 [95%CI: 1.05C1.20]), those with hiatal hernia (0.11% vs 0.08% OR 1.31 [95%CI: 0.98C1.76]) and obese (0.13% vs 0.07%, OR 1.91;95%CI: 1.81C2.02]). In multivariable model, the incidence of COVID with PPI use was modified with gender after adjusting for other risk factors for COVID -19 from the univariate model. Female patients using PPIs had higher risk of COVID-19 (OR 9.94, 95%CI: 8.91-11.09) than their male counterparts using PPI (OR 1.20, 95%CI: 1.04C1.36). This interaction was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: PPI use in patients with GERD is associated with higher risk of COVID-19, especially among female patients and those with Barretts esophagus.

Newly attenuated Salmonella vaccine constructs expressing TGEV S protein epitopes were studied and evaluated for improved humoral immune response to TGEV. The macrophage-inducible Salmonella ssaH and spiC/ssaB promoters were compared for their ability to express the TGEV C and A epitopes in the context of the heterologous 987P fimbriae on Salmonella vaccines. Compared to the ssaH promoter, the Salmonella cya crp vector elicited significantly higher levels of mucosal and systemic antibodies in orally immunized mice when the chimeric fimbriae were expressed from the spiC promoter. The Salmonella spiC promoter construct induced the highest level of chimeric fimbriae after being taken up by the J774A.1 macrophagelike cells. The Salmonella cya crp vaccine vector was shown to incorporate into 987P partially degraded chimeric subunits lacking the TGEV epitopes. In contrast, its isogenic pgtE mutant produced fimbriae consisting exclusively of intact chimeric subunits. Mice immunized orally with the Salmonella pgtE vaccine expressing chimeric fimbriae from the spiC promoter elicited significantly higher systemic and mucosal antibody titers against the TGEV epitopes compared to the parental vaccine.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dysphonia, and its severity and extent, of voice fatigue and of dysphagia in non hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 in Lombardy, the Italian region most hit by the first explosive outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 160 consecutive patients, with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by nasal swabs processed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were gathered by means of telephone interviews performed by physicians in charge of daily follow-up. General and specific symptoms concerning voice and swallowing impairment were investigated. Dysphonia grade and duration were graded on 4-point scales, while voice fatigue was graded on a 5-point scale. RESULTS: Dysphonia was reported by 70 (43.7%) patients and was positively associated with voice fatigue (P < 0.001), cough (P = 0.005), rhinitis (P = 0.01), and dyspnea (P = 0.06); it was mild and/or moderate in 69 patients, but its duration was > 2 weeks in 33/70 (47.1%) patients and >1 month in 11/70 (15.7%). Grade and duration of dysphonia were positively associated with cough and rhinitis (all P values < 0.01). Voice fatigue was reported by 43/160 patients (26.8%) and its severity was correlated with dysphonia (P < 0.0001), cough (P = 0.02), rhinitis (P = 0.02), dyspnea (P < 0.001), and loss of appetite (P = 0.01). Dysphagia was encountered in 27/160 patients (16.9%) and was associated with dysgeusia, cough, arthralgia, myalgia and loss of appetite but not with dysphonia.

The masks of these two parts of images then were converted to corresponding volumes to calculate the physical proportion of infected region of lung. A total of 129 CT image set were herein collected and studied. The intrinsic Hounsfiled value of CT images was firstly utilized to generate the initial dirty version of labeled masks both for intact lung and infected regions. Then, the samples were carefully adjusted and improved by two professional radiologists to generate the final training set and test benchmark. Two deep learning models were evaluated: UNet and 2.5D UNet. For the segment of infected regions, a deep learning based classifier was followed to remove unrelated blur-edged regions that were wrongly segmented out such as air tube and blood vessel tissue etc. For the segmented masks of intact lung and infected regions, the best method could achieve 0.972 and 0.757 measure in mean Dice similarity coefficient on our test benchmark. As the overall proportion of infected region of lung, the final result showed 0.961 (Pearson's correlation coefficient) and 11.7% (mean absolute percent error).

Mainstream process mining tools are designed for intra-organizational settings, insofar as they assume that an event log is available for processing as a whole. The use of such tools for inter-organizational process analysis is hampered by the fact that such processes involve independent parties who are unwilling to, or sometimes legally prevented from, sharing detailed event logs with each other. In this setting, this paper proposes an approach for constructing and querying a common artifact used for process mining, namely the frequency and time-annotated Directly-Follows Graph (DFG), over multiple event logs belonging to different parties, in such a way that the parties do not share the event logs with each other. The proposal leverages an existing platform for secure multi-party computation, namely Sharemind. Since a direct implementation of DFG construction in Sharemind suffers from scalability issues, we propose to rely on vectorization of event logs and to employ a divide-and-conquer scheme for parallel processing of sub-logs.

A continuum mechanical description of the motion of this interface, or phase boundary, takes the form of a kinetic law which relates the thermodynamic driving force across it with its velocity in the reference configuration. For biological macromolecules immersed in a heat bath, thermally activated kinetics described by the Arrhenius law is often a good choice. Here we show that 'stick-slip' kinetics, characteristic of friction, can also arise in an overdamped bistable bar immersed in a heat bath. To mimic a rod-like biomolecule we model the bar as a chain of masses and bistable springs moving in a viscous fluid. We conduct Langevin dynamics calculations on the chain and extract a temperature dependent kinetic relation by observing that the dissipation at a phase boundary can be estimated by performing an energy balance. Using this kinetic relation we solve boundary value problems for a bistable bar immersed in a constant temperature bath and show that the resultant force-extension relation matches very well with the Langevin dynamics results. We estimate the force fluctuations at the pulled end of the bar due to thermal kicks from the bath by using a partition function. We also show rate dependence of hysteresis in cyclic loading of the bar arising from the stick-slip kinetics. Our kinetic relation could be applied to rod-like biomolecules, such as, DNA and coiled-coil proteins which exhibit structural transitions that depend on both temperature and loading rate.","output":"Stick-slip kinetics in a bistable bar immersed in a heat bath"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyzes the long-term effects of COVID-19 on financial volatility We estimate the long memory parameters before and after COVID-19 for the VIX and realized variances for several international markets Our results show that volatility measures for most countries experienced increases in the degrees of memory following the pandemic Moreover, several volatility measures became nonstationary, signaling the start of a period with higher and more persistent financial volatility We show that these changes in the degrees of memory are statistically significant using a test for change in persistence","output":"The persistence of financial volatility after COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Evidence regarding corticosteroid use for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited.

Of these, 403 were randomized to open-label interventions within the corticosteroid domain. The domain was halted after results from another trial were released. Follow-up ended August 12, 2020. Interventions The corticosteroid domain randomized participants to a fixed 7-day course of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg or 100 mg every 6 hours) (n = 143), a shock-dependent course (50 mg every 6 hours when shock was clinically evident) (n = 152), or no hydrocortisone (n = 108). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was organ support-free days (days alive and free of ICU-based respiratory or cardiovascular support) within 21 days, where patients who died were assigned -1 day. The primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model that included all patients enrolled with severe COVID-19, adjusting for age, sex, site, region, time, assignment to interventions within other domains, and domain and intervention eligibility. Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority >99%). Results After excluding 19 participants who withdrew consent, there were 384 patients (mean age, 60 years; 29% female) randomized to the fixed-dose (n = 137), shock-dependent (n = 146), and no (n = 101) hydrocortisone groups; 379 (99%) completed the study and were included in the analysis. The mean age for the 3 groups ranged between 59.5 and 60.4 years; most patients were male (range, 70.6%-71.5%); mean body mass index ranged between 29.7 and 30.9; and patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged between 50.0% and 63.5%. For the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively, the median organ support-free days were 0 (IQR, -1 to 15), 0 (IQR, -1 to 13), and 0 (-1 to 11) days (composed of 30%, 26%, and 33% mortality rates and 11.5, 9.5, and 6 median organ support-free days among survivors). The median adjusted odds ratio and bayesian probability of superiority were 1.43 (95% credible interval, 0.91-2.27) and 93% for fixed-dose hydrocortisone, respectively, and were 1.22 (95% credible interval, 0.76-1.94) and 80% for shock-dependent hydrocortisone compared with no hydrocortisone. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 (3%), 5 (3%), and 1 (1%) patients in the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, resulted in 93% and 80% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support-free days within 21 days. However, the trial was stopped early and no treatment strategy met prespecified criteria for statistical superiority, precluding definitive conclusions.

Objective: To sum up and unify current knowledge and clinical experience of Swiss neurological and neurosurgical communities regarding MRgHiFUS interventions for brain disorders to be published as a national consensus paper. Methods: Eighteen experienced neurosurgeons and neurologists practicing in Switzerland in the field of movement disorders and one health physicist representing 15 departments of 12 Swiss clinical centers and 5 medical societies participated in the workshop and contributed to the consensus paper. All experts have experience with current treatment modalities or with MRgHiFUS. They were invited to participate in two workshops and consensus meetings and one online meeting. As part of workshop preparations, a thorough literature review was undertaken and distributed among participants together with a list of relevant discussion topics. Special emphasis was put on current experience and practice, and areas of controversy regarding clinical application of MRgHiFUS for functional neurosurgery. Results: The recommendations addressed lesioning for treatment of brain disorders in general, and with respect to MRgHiFUS indications, stereotactic targets, treatment alternatives, patient selection and management, standardization of reporting and follow-up, and initialization of a national registry for interventional therapies of movement disorders. Good clinical evidence is presently only available for unilateral thalamic lesioning in treating essential tremor or tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease and, to a minor extent, for unilateral subthalamotomy for Parkinson's disease motor features. However, the workgroup unequivocally recommends further exploration and adaptation of MRgHiFUS-based functional lesioning interventions and confirms the need for outcome-based evaluation of these approaches based on a unified registry. MRgHiFUS and DBS should be evaluated by experts familiar with both methods, as they are mutually complementing therapy options to be appreciated for their distinct advantages and potential. Conclusion: This multidisciplinary consensus paper is a representative current recommendation for safe implementation and standardized practice of MRgHiFUS treatments for functional neurosurgery in Switzerland.","output":"Consensus Statement on High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Functional Neurosurgery in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Acute loss of smell and taste are well-recognized symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet the correlation between self-reported and psychophysical olfactory function remains unclear. Understanding the reliability of self-reported smell loss in ambulatory cases can assess the utility of this screening measure. METHODS A prospective, longitudinal study evaluating patient-reported and measured olfactory function using the validated 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) was conducted on adult outpatients with COVID-19. Patient-reported olfaction scores using a visual analog scale (VAS) were obtained at baseline, time of COVID-19 testing, and time of BSIT completion. Linear associations between VAS and BSIT were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of VAS scores were calculated. Logistic regression identified characteristics associated with accurate assessment of olfactory function. RESULTS A total of 81 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 positive subjects, of whom 54 self-reported smell loss, were prospectively recruited 5 days from diagnosis date between May 8, 2020, and July 8, 2020. Self-reported smell loss had good discriminative ability in identifying abnormal BSIT (area under receiver operating curve [AUC] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.92). A VAS <5 demonstrated sensitivity of 0.62 and specificity of 0.94 for predicting hyposmia (BSIT 8) with accuracy of 82.7%, whereas a VAS <9 had highest sensitivity at 0.86. Moderate bivariate linear associations were found between VAS and BSIT scores (rs = 0.59, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Self-reported olfactory loss associated with COVID-19 has a strong ability to predict abnormal olfactory function though the 2 measures are moderately correlated.

Elective operations performed between 27 March 2020 and 10 August 2020 were included and compared with cases performed between 27 March and 10 August in both 2018 and 2019. Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality, 30-day complications, and nosocomial infection rates of COVID-19. Findings Fewer elective operations were performed in 2020 (258) compared with 2019 (1196) and 2018 (1261). The rate of nosocomial infection in the 2020 cohort was 0%.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), ranging from wearing masks to (partial) lockdowns have been implemented as mitigation measures around the globe. However, especially severe NPIs are used with great caution due to their negative effects on the economy, social life and mental well-being. Thus, understanding the impact of the pandemic on ICU demand under alternative scenarios reflecting different levels of NPIs is vital for political decision-making on NPIs. Objective The aim is to support political decision-making by forecasting COVID-19-related ICU demand under alternative scenarios of COVID-19 progression reflecting different levels of NPIs. Substantial sub-national variation in COVID-19-related ICU demand requires a spatially disaggregated approach. This should not only take sub-national variation in ICU-relevant disease dynamics into account, but also variation in the population at risk including COVID-19-relevant risk characteristics (e.g. age), and factors mitigating the pandemic. The forecast provides indications for policy makers and health care stakeholders as to whether mitigation measures have to be maintained or even strengthened to prevent ICU demand from exceeding supply, or whether there is leeway to relax them. Methods We implement a spatial age-structured microsimulation model of the COVID-19 pandemic by extending the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) framework. The model accounts for regional variation in population age structure and in spatial diffusion pathways. In a first step, we calibrate the model by applying a genetic optimization algorithm against hospital data on ICU patients with COVID-19. In a second step, we forecast COVID-19-related ICU demand under alternative scenarios of COVID 19 progression reflecting different levels of NPIs. We apply the model to Germany and provide state-level forecasts over a 2-month period, which can be updated daily based on latest data on the progression of the pandemic. Results To illustrate the merits of our model, we present here forecasts of ICU demand for different stages of the pandemic during 2020. Our forecasts for a quiet summer phase with low infection rates identified quite some variation in potential for relaxing NPIs across the federal states. By contrast, our forecasts during a phase of quickly rising infection numbers in autumn (second wave) suggested that all federal states should implement additional NPIs. However, the identified needs for additional NPIs varied again across federal states. In addition, our model suggests that during large infection waves ICU demand would quickly exceed supply, if there were no NPIs in place to contain the virus. Conclusion Our results provide evidence for substantial spatial variation in (1) the effect of the pandemic on ICU demand, and (2) the potential and need for NPI adjustments at different stages of the pandemic. Forecasts with our spatial age-structured microsimulation model allow to take this spatial variation into account. The model is programmed in R and can be applied to other countries, provided that reliable data on the number of ICU patients infected with COVID-19 are available at sub-national level.","output":"Forecasting intensive care unit demand during the COVID-19 pandemic: A spatial age-structured microsimulation model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to investigate mental health among Chinese people living in areas with differing levels of infection severity during the COVID-19 outbreak. It also assesses the association between reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety and mental health in times of crises. A sample of 1,201 Chinese participants was surveyed between April and June 2020. Wuhan city (where 23.4% of participants resided), Hubei province outside Wuhan (13.4% of participants), and elsewhere in China (63.1% of participants) were categorized into high, moderate, and low infection severity areas, respectively. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales severity cut-points were used to categorize participants. In the overall sample, 20.9, 34.2, and 29.0% of the participants showed elevated (mild to extremely severe) levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Those in the highest infection severity group were significantly more likely to be categorized as having elevated levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. General linear modeling was performed on a composite mental distress variable (taking into account stress, anxiety, and depression scores). This model indicated that, even after adjusting for group differences in age, gender, education, and filial piety, the high infection severity group displayed more mental distress than the low infection severity groups. The model also found reciprocal filial piety to have a negative association with mental distress. Conversely, authoritarian filial piety was found to be unrelated to mental distress when controlling for the other variables in the model. No evidence was found for an interaction between either authoritarian or reciprocal filial piety and infection severity, which suggests that the negative association observed between reciprocal filial piety and mental distress was relatively consistent across the three infection severity groups. The findings suggest that future public health programs may integrate the promotion of filial piety as a strategy to help Chinese people maintain good mental health in the face of pandemic crises.","output":"Mental Health of Chinese People During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Infection Severity of Region of Residence and Filial Piety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the long-term results and patient's satisfaction of a new approach using the LigaSure? 5 mm instrument for treatment of Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) and to compare with other long-term results using traditional treatment modalities.

With prompt clinical and radiological recognition of these fatal, yet treatable complications of COVID-19 pneumonia, the patient was saved and had an uneventful recovery.","output":"Post-COVID-19 pulmonary cavitation and tension pneumothorax in a non-ventilated patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world continues to face uncertainty due to COVID-19, there is concern for adolescent wellbeing as they attempt to cope with changes to their education and social interactions. Considering the trade-offs between physical distancing and virtual education versus in-person instruction may be particularly pertinent to understanding adolescent loneliness and worries surrounding COVID-19 and their academics. Adolescents (N = 1,708; age M = 12.42, SD = 2.40; 53.3% girls and 46.7% boys) from the United States self-reported their perceptions of social support, COVID-19 attitudes, and indicators of wellbeing (i.e., loneliness, COVID-19 stress, academic worry) in an online cross-sectional survey between November 30, 2020 to December 21, 2020. Higher levels of social support and attitudes of lower COVID-19 concern were associated with lower levels of loneliness, COVID-19 stress, and academic worries. Adolescents receiving greater virtual instruction were more worried about their academics compared to those receiving greater in-person instruction. A moderation effect between loneliness and instruction type revealed that the effect of social support was stronger for those receiving greater virtual instruction. Despite the quick and dramatic change to ones education, adolescents were relatively unaffected by the type of instruction they had recently received. Instead, perceived social support and their attitudes toward COVID-19 were more strongly related to their wellbeing.","output":"Factors contributing to adolescents COVID-19-related loneliness, distress, and worries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spinal pain is an important clinical presentation in feline patients, but the underlying causes can often be difficult to elucidate.

Which of these obtains depends on the nature of the crisis. We examine whether and how the onset of the global pandemic shifted public opinion toward the president, elections, and democracy in Haiti. We embedded two experiments in a phone survey administered to a nationally representative sample of Haitians in April-June 2020. We find that the early pandemic boosted presidential approval and intentions to vote for the incumbent president, consistent with a rally effect. These results show that a rally effect occurs even in the most unlikely of placesCan unstable context in which the incumbent president is struggling to maintain order and support.

From the perspective of international public health law and policy, a precondition for success is that financial resources and funds are employed in an effective manner. Whether the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ('World Bank' or 'WB') and the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility ('PEF') - a financing mechanism housed at the WB - may be perceived as effective public health players shall be established by referring to their mandates, their inherent capacity for enhancing accepted global legal standards and rules on public health and their funding methods and practices. After the affirmation and consolidation of its role in the public health sector in the early 1990s, the WB has rapidly accredited itself as the most active intergovernmental institution dealing with pandemic and epidemic financing. Its direct involvement in public health trust funds, such as the Avian Flu Trust Fund Facility and the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Multi-Donor Fund (the HEPRF), and its lending practices and internal policies and procedures were of crucial significance in this respect. Considering that acceptance of international institutions, including international financial institutions, has always been conditioned by their acknowledgment as legally legitimate, legitimacy is regarded as closely connected to effectiveness. The criteria for establishing legitimacy in relation to international financial institutions are increasingly, amongst others, the respect and promotion of rule of law standards in the recipient states. From this perspective, the WB's functional and management structures, but not the PEF's structures and management, have made noteworthy progress, and notwithstanding some deficiencies and peculiarities they present several elements of legitimate decision-making. ?

AIMS: This bibliometric analysis seeks to quantify the growth, trends, and applications of technology in psychotherapeutic interventions over the last 40 years. METHODS: Searches were conducted in the Web of Science (WOS) database for all existing technology-psychotherapy-related publications from 1981 to October 2020. Search terms were refined using a systematic screening strategy, based upon Cochrane protocol, generating 52 technology terms. Analyses across 40 years and by decade from 1981 to 2020 were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 13,934 peer-reviewed articles were identified. Yearly publication rate has increased from one in 1981 to 1902 by October 2020. The growth rate of publications across decades consistently tripled in size (762.50% from the 1980s to 1990s, 539.71% from the 1990s to 2000s, and 337.24% from the 2000s to 2010s). The author, country, journal, and institution with the most publications were Andersson, G., USA, Journal of Medical Internet Research, and Karolinska Institute, respectively. The most frequent technology search term across all four decades was internet*.

Design Case-control study with follow-up linkage to administrative healthcare databases for up to 25 years. Setting The study population comprises all children (0-14 years) registered for primary care with the National Health Service (NHS) in England 1992-1996. Participants 1082 five-year survivors of ALL diagnosed <15 years of age, and 2018 age- and sex-matched population-based controls; followed to 15 March 2020. Main outcome measures Associations with hospital activity, cancer, and mortality were assessed using incidence rate ratios and absolute risk difference. Results Mortality 5-25 years after diagnosis was 20 times higher in cases than controls (Rate Ratio 21.3, 95% Confidence Interval 11.2-45.6), and cancer incidence 10 time higher (IRR 9.9 95% CI 4.1-29.1). Hospital activity was increased for many clinical specialties, the strongest effects being for endocrinology; outpatient IRR 36.7, 95% CI 17.3-93.4 and inpatient 19.7, 95% CI 1.9-25.5 for males, and 11.0, 95% CI 6.2-21.1 and 6.2 95% CI 3.1-13.5 respectively for females. Notable excesses were also evident for cardiology, neurology, ophthalmology, respiratory medicine and general medicine. Males were also more likely to attend gastroenterology, ENT (ear, nose and throat), urology, and dermatology; while females were more likely to be seen in plastic surgery and less likely in midwifery. Conclusions Adding to a large excess risk of death and cancer, survivors of childhood ALL experience excess outpatient and inpatient activity across their TYA years. Involving most clinical specialties, the observed effects are striking, showing no signs of diminishing over the first 25 years of follow-up. These findings underscore the need to take prior ALL drug and/or radiation treatment into account when interpreting seemingly unrelated symptoms in later life.","output":"Excess morbidity and mortality among survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: 25 years of follow-up from the United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study (UKCCS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of our work was to assess the independent and incremental value of AI-derived quantitative determination of lung lesions extent on initial CT scan for the prediction of clinical deterioration or death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. 323 consecutive patients (mean age 65  15 years, 192 men), with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and an abnormal chest CT scan, were admitted to the hospital between March and December 2020.

COVID-19 also has an unneglected effect on migraine patients. Migraine attack frequency as one of migraine characteristics, its impact during COVID-19 deserves further research. We aimed to evaluate whether migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic differed from pre-COVID-19, and explore their possible influencing factors during the pandemic. METHOD: This prospective cohort study enrolled 187 migraine patients who came from the Department of Neurology of West China Hospital from October 2019 to December 2019. After inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 157 patients were included. We collected demographic data, clinical characteristics and epidemiological contact information and followed up on March 2020. Then Paired-Samples T test, logistic regression and interaction tests were used to analyze data. RESULT: We found that value of migraine attack frequency was 2.47  1.12 before and 3.54  1.79 during COVID-19 (P<0.0001). Then we divided patients into two group based on the difference of migraine attack frequency between COVID-19 period and pre-COVID-19 and employed logistic regression analysis. In the logistic regression analysis, divorced status (OR=6.53, P=0.0453), good sleep pre-COVID-19 and poor sleep during COVID-19 (OR=3.11, P=0.0432) had independent effect on migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic.

T. cruzi Loopamp accuracy was estimated using the case definition in the different groups as a reference. Cohen's kappa coefficient (&#954;) was applied to measure the agreement between Tc LAMP (index test) and qPCR (reference test). Sensitivity and specificity of T. cruzi Loopamp kit in blood samples from the pooled clinical groups was 93% (95% CI: 77-99) and 100% (95% CI: 80-100) respectively.

CaMKII activity is promoted by both oxidation and O-linked -N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) of known CaMKII sites. OBJECTIVE: To investigate which posttranslational modifications occur in human diabetic hearts and how they alter electrophysiological and Ca(2+) handling properties in hyperglycemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed echocardiography, electrophysiology, Ca(2+)-handling, and protein expression in site-specific CaMKII mutant mice (O-GlcNAc-resistant S280A and oxidation-resistant MM281/2VV knock-ins, and global and cardiac-specific knockouts), in myocytes subjected to acute hyperglycemia and Ang II (angiotensin II) and mice after streptozotocin injections (to induce diabetes). Human patients with diabetes exhibit elevated CaMKII O-GlcNAcylation but not oxidation. In mice, acute hyperglycemia increased spontaneous diastolic Ca(2+) sparks and waves and arrhythmogenic action potential changes (prolongation, alternans, and delayed afterdepolarizations), all of which required CaMKII-S280 O-GlcNAcylation. Ang II effects were dependent on NOX2 (NADPH oxidase 2)-mediated CaMKII MM281/2 oxidation. Diabetes led to much greater Ca(2+) leak, RyR2 S2814 phosphorylation, electrophysiological remodeling, and increased susceptibility to in vivo arrhythmias, requiring CaMKII activation, predominantly via S280 O-GlcNAcylation and less via MM281/2 oxidation. These effects were present in myocytes at normal glucose but were exacerbated with the in vivo high circulating glucose. PLB (phospholamban) O-GlcNAcylation was increased and coincided with reduced PLB S16 phosphorylation in diabetes. Dantrolene, which reverses CaMKII-dependent proarrhythmic RyR-mediated Ca(2+) leak, also prevented hyperglycemia-induced APD prolongation and delayed afterdepolarizations. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CaMKII-S280 O-GlcNAcylation is required for increased arrhythmia susceptibility in diabetic hyperglycemia, which can be worsened by an additional Ang II-NOX2-CaMKII MM281/2 oxidation pathway. CaMKII-dependent RyR2 S2814 phosphorylation markedly increases proarrhythmic Ca(2+) leak and PLB O-GlcNAcylation may limit sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) reuptake, leading to impaired excitation-contraction coupling and arrhythmogenesis in diabetic hyperglycemia.","output":"CaMKII Serine 280 O-GlcNAcylation Links Diabetic Hyperglycemia to Proarrhythmia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An under-representation of women and a lack of sex-specific analyses in COVID-19 trials has been suggested.

This indicates that there is no structural under-representation of women in the COVID-19 trials. Currently, sex-specific efficacy data are available for five of the six assessed products and sex-specific safety data are available for half of the products only. It is important that this information will also be made available for the other products.

To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search and evaluation of new treatment modalities and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. METHODS: We included 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Denmark between April 3(rd) and July 9(th) 2020, at least 14 days after COVID-19 symptom recovery. The participants had experienced a range of disease severities from asymptomatic to severe. We collected plasma, serum and PBMC's for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response by Meso Scale analysis including other coronavirus strains, ACE2 competition, IgA ELISA, pseudovirus neutralization capacity, and dextramer flow cytometry analysis of CD8(+) T cells. The immunological outcomes were compared amongst severity groups within the cohort, and 10 pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. FINDINGS: We report broad serological profiles within the cohort, detecting antibody binding to other human coronaviruses. 202(>99%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 193(95%) individuals. A significant positive correlation (r=0.7804) between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed.

At the initial peak, there were more than 700 inpatients at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB), one of the largest NHS trusts in the UK (2700 beds and more than 21000 members of staff). The UHB tertiary Sarcoidosis Service looks after over 500 people with the condition. In March 2020 individuals felt to be at very high risk of severe COVID-19 were identified as clinically extremely vulnerable by NHS England and advised to shield March-July 2020. Though not initially specified, those with sarcoidosis were included on the national register following specialist consensus discussion. The aim was to assess whether patients receiving immunosuppression therapy for sarcoidosis (corticosteroids, diseasemodifying agents or biological agents) received and followed guidance to shield, alongside assessing the impact and unintended consequences of this guidance (diagnosis of COVID-19 and psychological impact). Methods:Sarcoidosis patients receiving immunosuppression therapy were identified from existing clinical databases and contacted to complete a telephone interview. Electronic medical records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and organ system involvement, treatments, co-morbidities, ethnicity and BMI. Results:A total of 115 patients on immunosuppression during the study period were identified. The mean age was 57 and mean BMI was 29. Pulmonary involvement was a feature in 92%, extrapulmonary systemic involvement in 46%. Half the patients (53%) were white British and 37% from Black and Ethnic minorities. Interviews were completed by 76 of the 109 patients. There were 6 deaths, one from confirmed COVID-19.

Symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were experienced by 3 patients none were eligible for a swab at that time. Most interviewed felt they had received enough information in the context of general uncertainty regarding COVID-19, however, some reported confusion as to when to stop shielding. Many spoke of the difficulties of shielding;they felt lonely and isolated. Some people felt fearful that they received the information too late, delaying onset of shielding.

We sought to investigate how governmental actions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic related to the concept of resilience, how these actions contributed to the potential for resilient performance in healthcare, and what opportunities exist for governments to foster resilience within healthcare systems. METHODS We conducted case studies of government actions pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales, Australia and Ontario, Canada. Using media releases issued by each government between December 2019 and August 2020, we performed qualitative content analysis to identify themes relevant to the resilience potentials (anticipate, monitor, respond, learn) and RiH. RESULTS Direct references to the term 'resilience' appeared in the media releases of both governments. However, these references focused on the reactive aspects of resilience. While actions that constitute the resilience potentials were evident, the media releases also revealed opportunities to enhance learning (eg, a need to capitalize on opportunities for double-loop learning and identify strategies appropriate for complex systems) and anticipating (eg, incorporating the concept of hedging into frameworks of RiH). CONCLUSION Though fostering RiH through government action remains a challenge, this study suggests opportunities to realize this goal. Articulating a proactive vision of resilience and recognizing the complex nature of current systems could enhance governments' ability to coordinate resilient performance in healthcare. Reflection on how anticipation relates to resilience appears necessary at both the practical and conceptual levels to further develop the capacity for RiH.","output":"Government Actions and Their Relation to Resilience in Healthcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic in New South Wales, Australia and Ontario, Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bijna veertien weken leefden we met een intelligente lockdown en social distance van 1,5 meter.

Traditionally, surgical trainees acquired these skills in the operating room; however, operative time for residents has decreased with duty hour restrictions. As in other professions, video analysis may help maximize the learning experience. Objective To develop and evaluate a postoperative video-based coaching intervention for residents. Design, Setting, and Participants In this mixed methods analysis, 10 senior (postgraduate year 4 and 5) residents were videorecorded operating with an attending surgeon at an academic tertiary care hospital. Each video formed the basis of a 1-hour one-on-one coaching session conducted by the operative attending; although a coaching framework was provided, participants determined the specific content collaboratively. Teaching points were identified in the operating room and the video-based coaching sessions; iterative inductive coding, followed by thematic analysis, was performed. Main Outcomes and Measures Teaching points made in the operating room were compared with those in the video-based coaching sessions with respect to initiator, content, and teaching technique, adjusting for time. Results Among 10 cases, surgeons made more teaching points per unit time (63.0 vs 102.7 per hour) while coaching. Teaching in the video-based coaching sessions was more resident centered; attendings were more inquisitive about residents' learning needs (3.30 vs 0.28, P = .04), and residents took more initiative to direct their education (27% [198 of 729 teaching points] vs 17% [331 of 1977 teaching points], P < .001). Surgeons also more frequently validated residents' experiences (8.40 vs 1.81, P < .01), and they tended to ask more questions to promote critical thinking (9.30 vs 3.32, P = .07) and set more learning goals (2.90 vs 0.28, P = .11). More complex topics, including intraoperative decision making (mean, 9.70 vs 2.77 instances per hour, P = .03) and failure to progress (mean, 1.20 vs 0.13 instances per hour, P = .04) were addressed, and they were more thoroughly developed and explored. Excerpts of dialogue are presented to illustrate these findings. Conclusions and Relevance Video-based coaching is a novel and feasible modality for supplementing intraoperative learning.

Goals achievement, motor function, and parental satisfaction were evaluated. Each program was carried out by the participant's parents and remotely supervised via Skype calls, twice by a therapist experienced in RTT rehabilitation. RESULTS Thirty-seven (78.7%) rehabilitative goals were achieved or overachieved. Ten participants (76.9%) significantly increased their gross motor functional level with a medium size effect (0.604).

Therefore, viral mRNAs have to compete for ribosomes and translation factors with cellular mRNAs. To succeed, eukaryotic viruses adopt multiple strategies. One is to circumvent the need for m(7)G-cap through alternative instruments for ribosome recruitment. These include internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), which make translation independent of the free 5 end, or cap-independent translational enhancers (CITEs), which promote initiation at the uncapped 5 end, even if located in 3 untranslated regions (3 UTRs). Even if a virus uses the canonical cap-dependent ribosome recruitment, it can still perturb conventional ribosomal scanning and start codon selection. The pressure for genome compression often gives rise to internal and overlapping open reading frames. Their translation is initiated through specific mechanisms, such as leaky scanning, 43S sliding, shunting, or coupled termination-reinitiation. Deviations from the canonical initiation reduce the dependence of viral mRNAs on translation initiation factors, thereby providing resistance to antiviral mechanisms and cellular stress responses. Moreover, viruses can gain advantage in a competition for the translational machinery by inactivating individual translational factors and/or replacing them with viral counterparts. Certain viruses even create specialized intracellular translation factories, which spatially isolate the sites of their protein synthesis from cellular antiviral systems, and increase availability of translational components. However, these virus-specific mechanisms may become the Achilles heel of a viral life cycle. Thus, better understanding of the unconventional mechanisms of viral mRNA translation initiation provides valuable insight for developing new approaches to antiviral therapy.","output":"Non-Canonical Translation Initiation Mechanisms Employed by Eukaryotic Viral mRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The European Respiratory Society (ERS) accepted 4062 abstracts for presentation at the ERS International Congress in 2020.

The structures at the 3' end of the viral genome are highly conserved among divergent flaviviruses, suggesting that they may function as cis-acting signals for RNA replication and, as such, might specifically bind to cellular or viral proteins. UV cross-linking experiments were performed to identify the proteins that bind with the JEV plus-strand 3' noncoding region (NCR). Two proteins, p71 and p110, from JEV-infected but not from uninfected cell extracts were shown to bind specifically to the plus-strand 3' NCR. The quantities of these binding proteins increased during the course of JEV infection and correlated with the levels of JEV RNA synthesis in cell extracts. UV cross-linking coupled with Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the p110 and p71 proteins were JEV NS5 and NS3, respectively, which are proposed as components of the RNA replicase. The putative stem-loop structure present within the plus-strand 3' NCR was required for the binding of these proteins. Furthermore, both proteins could interact with each other and form a protein-protein complex in vivo. These findings suggest that the 3' NCR of JEV genomic RNA may form a replication complex together with NS3 and NS5; this complex may be involved in JEV minus-strand RNA synthesis.","output":"RNA-protein interactions: involvement of NS3, NS5, and 3' noncoding regions of Japanese encephalitis virus genomic RNA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurological manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection are present in up to 80% of the affected patients.

PATIENTS: Ten intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: We performed a two-step positive end-expiratory pressure trial with change of 10 cm H2O in random order. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, we assessed arterial blood gases, respiratory mechanics, ventilation inhomogeneity, and potential for lung recruitment by electrical impedance tomography. Potential for lung recruitment was assessed by the recently described recruitment to inflation ratio. In a subgroup of seven paralyzed patients, we also measured ventilation-perfusion mismatch at lower positive end-expiratory pressure by electrical impedance tomography. At higher positive end-expiratory pressure, respiratory mechanics did not change significantly: compliance remained relatively high with low driving pressure. Oxygenation and ventilation inhomogeneity improved but arterial CO2 increased despite unchanged respiratory rate and tidal volume. The recruitment to inflation ratio presented median value higher than previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients but with large variability (median, 0.79 [0.53-1.08]; range, 0.16-1.40). The FIO2 needed to obtain viable oxygenation at lower positive end-expiratory pressure was significantly correlated with the recruitment to inflation ratio (r = 0.603; p = 0.05). The ventilation-perfusion mismatch was elevated (median, 34% [32-45%] of lung units) and, in six out of seven patients, ventilated nonperfused units represented a much larger proportion than perfused nonventilated ones.

Reovirus binds to cell surface glycans, junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A), and the Nogo-1 receptor (depending on the cell type) and enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Within the endocytic compartment, reovirus undergoes stepwise disassembly, which is followed by release of the transcriptionally active viral core into the cytoplasm. In a small-molecule screen to identify host mediators of reovirus infection, we found that treatment of cells with 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT), a prototype serotonin receptor agonist, diminished reovirus cytotoxicity. 5-NT also blocked reovirus infection. In contrast, treatment of cells with methiothepin mesylate, a serotonin antagonist, enhanced infection by reovirus. 5-NT did not alter cell surface expression of JAM-A or attachment of reovirus to cells. However, 5-NT altered the distribution of early endosomes with a concomitant impairment of reovirus transit to late endosomes and a delay in reovirus disassembly. Consistent with an inhibition of viral disassembly, 5-NT treatment did not alter infection by in vitro-generated infectious subvirion particles, which bind to JAM-A but bypass a requirement for proteolytic uncoating in endosomes to infect cells. We also found that treatment of cells with 5-NT decreased the infectivity of alphavirus chikungunya virus and coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. These data suggest that serotonin receptor signaling influences cellular activities that regulate entry of diverse virus families and provides a new, potentially broad-spectrum target for antiviral drug development. IMPORTANCE Identification of well-characterized small molecules that modulate viral infection can accelerate development of antiviral therapeutics while also providing new tools to increase our understanding of the cellular processes that underlie virus-mediated cell injury. We conducted a small-molecule screen to identify compounds capable of inhibiting cytotoxicity caused by reovirus, a prototype double-stranded RNA virus. We found that 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT) impairs reovirus infection by altering viral transport during cell entry. Remarkably, 5-NT also inhibits infection by an alphavirus and a coronavirus. The antiviral properties of 5-NT suggest that serotonin receptor signaling is an important regulator of infection by diverse virus families and illuminate a potential new drug target.","output":"Serotonin Receptor Agonist 5-Nonyloxytryptamine Alters the Kinetics of Reovirus Cell Entry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disease affecting the central nervous system and neurobehavioral development causing severe mental, linguistic, and physical disabilities. The purpose of this review was to analyze the most recent evidence regarding the rehabilitation of subjects affected by this syndrome. The review was carried out in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A total of 3661 studies were identified in the databases. Once the inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied, 15 studies were considered for the papers preparation. The level of evidence of the studies was established according to the criteria of the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based MedicineLevels of Evidence. From the selected studies, five rehabilitative approaches emerged: physiotherapy, applied behavioral analysis, toilet training, microswitch-cluster technology, and augmentative and alternative communication. Although the studies did not have a high level of evidence, the reported results appear to be encouraging and pave the way for further studies. It seems that individualized and multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions help to improve patients autonomy and quality of life. In some studies, the caregivers role was fundamental to identify preferences and long-term improvements.

In Germany, the reduction in life expectancy at birth between 2019 and 2020 was comparatively small, at -0.20 years. The decrease was stronger among men than among women (- 0.24 vs. - 0.13 years) and in eastern rather than in western Germany (-0.36 vs. -0.16 years). Men in eastern Germany experienced the biggest decline in life expectancy at birth (- 0.41 years). For western German men, the decline was less pronounced (- 0.19 years). Among women, the decline in life expectancy at birth was also greater in eastern (-0.25 years) than in western Germany (- 0.10 years). As a result of these developments, the differences in life expectancy between the two parts of Germany, and between women and men, increased compared with the previous year. Life expectancy at age 65 decreased more strongly than life expectancy at birth for both sexes and in all regions. This reflects the fact that it was mainly older age groups that were affected by the increase in mortality in 2020. This paper provides further insights into mortality changes in 2020, based on age decomposition and an analysis of lifespan inequality. We conclude that the population in eastern Germany was hit harder by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 than the population in the western Germany.","output":"Decrease in Life Expectancy in Germany in 2020: Men from Eastern Germany Most Affected"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The definition of stroke has changed over time, from a clinical only-based diagnosis to a more complex classification, including both clinical and imaging-based criteria, in part due to widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Areas covered: In this perspective, we summarize changes in the definition and diagnostic criteria for stroke and transient ischemic attacks. We examine how the introduction of MRI and standardized cognitive tests has affected our understanding of the safety of TAVR procedures. Finally, we review the growing evidence regarding the role of cerebral protection technology during TAVR procedures on cognitive function.

Moreover, using computational approaches, we assess whether these mutations are associated with changes in viral virulence. METHODS: We utilize genetic data from 144 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains from the Cypriot population obtained between March 2020 and January 2021, as well as all data available from GISAID. We combine this with countries regional information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of Cyprus-specific mutations are obtained by mutation tracking analysis. This entails calculating specific mutation frequencies within the Cypriot population and comparing these with their prevalence world-wide throughout the course of the pandemic. We further make use of linear regression models to extrapolate additional information that may be missed through standard statistical analysis. RESULTS: We report a single mutation found in the ORF1ab gene (nucleotide position 18,440) that appears to be significantly enriched within the Cypriot population. The amino acid change is denoted as S6059F, which maps to the SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 protein. We further analyse this mutation using regression models to investigate possible associations with increased deaths and cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutation infers a conformational change to the protein that significantly alters its structure when compared to the reference protein. CONCLUSIONS: Investigating Cyprus-specific mutations for SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a better understanding of viral pathogenicity. Researching these mutations can generate potential links between viral-specific mutations and the unique genomics of the Cypriot population. This can not only lead to important findings from which to battle the pandemic on a national level, but also provide insights into viral virulence worldwide.

In this study, we analyzed the molecular, biochemical, and antioxidant properties of GST alpha-4 from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaGSTA-4). Also, the spatial and temporal expression of HaGSTA-4 upon immune challenge with abiotic and biotic stimulants were evaluated. The HaGSTA-4 ORF encodes 223 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25.7 kDa, and an estimated isoelectric point (pI) of 8.47. It consists of the GST_C superfamily and thioredoxin-like superfamily domain. The phylogenetic tree revealed that HaGSTA-4 is evolutionarily conserved with its GST alpha class counterparts. From pairwise alignment, the highest values of identity (78.5%) and similarity (85.7%) were with Parambassis ranga GSTA-4. Protein rHaGSTA-4 exhibited the highest conjugation activity towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) at pH 7 and 20 C. A disk diffusion assay showed that rHaGSTA-4 significantly protects cells from the stress of exposure to ROS inducers such as CuSO4, CdCl2, and ZnCl2. Furthermore, overexpressed HaGSTA-4 defended cells against oxidative stress caused by H2O2; evidence of selenium-independent peroxidase activity. From qPCR, the tissue-specific expression profile demonstrates that HaGSTA-4 is most highly expressed in the kidney, followed by the intestine and stomach, among fourteen different tissues extracted from healthy seahorses. The mRNA expression profile of HaGSTA-4 upon immune challenge varied depending on the tissue and the time after challenge. Altogether, this study suggests that HaGSTA-4 may be involved in protection against oxidative stress, in immune defense regulation, and xenobiotic metabolism.","output":"Glutathione-S-transferase alpha-4 in Hippocampus abdominalis (big-belly seahorse): Molecular characterization, antioxidant properties, and its potent immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Venous (VTE) and arterial thromboembolic events are one of the most common complications in the Sars-Cov2 infection. Incidence of these complications ranges from 5% to 45%, as found among studies. Cancer is an established risk factor of thromboembolic events. However, it is not well known the incidence of thromboembolic events among cancer patients with COVID-19. Aim: To determine the incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic complications between hospitalized cancer patients with covid-19. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of cancer patients with COVID-19 admitted to Gregorio Mara?n General University Hospital from March to June 2020. Eligibility criteria required a positive polymerase chain reaction or IgG/IgM serology test for Sars-Cov2. The main objective is to obtain the incidence of thrombosis between hospitalized cancer patients with COVID-19. The secondary objective is to determine the mortality. Results: We included 79 patients, 64.6% male, with a mean age of 67.9 years old (range 31-94). The median follow-up of the patients was 110 days. Seventy-one patients (89.9%) had active cancer and 72.2% received oncology treatment in the previous 3 months. Sixty-six patients (83.5%) received therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation. Baseline characteristics of the patients are summarised in Table 1 overleaf. Five patients (6.3%) suffered a venous thrombosis, and no episodes of arterial thromboembolic events were reported at the end of the study. 3 patients (60%) developed a pulmonary embolism and 2 patients (40%) a deep venous thrombosis. Thirty patients died: 17 patients (56.7%) because of Covid-19, 10 patients (33.3%) due to tumour progression and 3 patients (10%) as a result of other causes. Mortality rate did not significantly differ among patients who developed thrombosis: 38% non-thrombosis vs 33.3% thrombosis;p=0.684. Conclusions: In our study the incidence of venous thromboembolic events among cancer patients with Covid-19 was found to be 6.3% and no arterial thromboembolic event was noticed. This figure is similar to the incidence reported in general population. Mortality was not higher among patients with thromboembolic events.

Validation parameters of authorised tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in respiratory samples are described in product labelling, whereas the published methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection from faecal samples have not permitted a robust description of the assay parameters. We aimed to develop and validate a test specifically for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human stool. Methods: In this validation study, we evaluated performance characteristics of a reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-rtPCR) test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human stool specimens by spiking stool with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 material. A modified version of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RT-rtPCR SARS-CoV-2 test was used for detection of viral RNA. Analytical sensitivity was evaluated in freshly spiked stool by testing two-fold dilutions in replicates of 20. Masked samples were tested by a second laboratory to evaluate interlaboratory reproducibility. Short-term (7-day) stability of viral RNA in stool samples was assessed with four different stool storage buffers (phosphate-buffered saline, Cary-Blair medium, Stool Transport and Recovery [STAR] buffer, and DNA/RNA Shield) kept at -80C, 4C, and ambient temperature (approximately 21C). We also tested clinical stool and anal swab specimens from patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive by nasopharyngeal testing. Findings: The lower limit of detection of the assay was found to be 3000 viral RNA copies per g of original stool sample, with 100% detection across 20 replicates assessed at this concentration. Analytical sensitivity was diminished by approximately two times after a single freeze-thaw cycle at -80C. At 100 times the limit of detection, spiked samples were generally stable in all four stool storage buffers tested for up to 7 days, with maximum changes in mean threshold cycle values observed at -80C storage in Cary-Blair medium (from 294 [SD 027] at baseline to 308 [017] at day 7; p<00001), at 4C storage in DNA/RNA Shield (from 285 [015] to 298 [009]; p=00019), and at ambient temperature in STAR buffer (from 304 [024] to 324 [062]; p=00083). 30 contrived SARS-CoV-2 samples were tested by a second laboratory and were correctly identified as positive or negative in at least one of two rounds of testing. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using this assay in the stool and anal swab specimens of 11 of 23 individuals known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation: This is a sensitive and reproducible assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human stool, with potential uses in faecal microbiota transplantation donor screening, sewage monitoring, and further research into the effects of faecal shedding on the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Speech-based detection can be one of the safest tools for this purpose as the voice of the suspected can be easily recorded. The Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) analysis of speech signal is one of the oldest but potential analysis tools. The performance of this analysis mainly depends on the use of conversion between normal frequency scale to perceptual frequency scale and the frequency range of the filters used. Traditionally, in speech recognition, these values are fixed. But the characteristics of speech signals vary from disease to disease. In the case of detection of COVID-19, mainly the coughing sounds are used whose bandwidth and properties are quite different from the complete speech signal. By exploiting these properties the efficiency of the COVID-19 detection can be improved. To achieve this objective the frequency range and the conversion scale of frequencies have been suitably optimized. Further to enhance the accuracy of detection performance, speech enhancement has been carried out before extraction of features. By implementing these two concepts a new feature called COVID-19 Coefficient (C-19CC) is developed in this paper.

The aim of the study was to assess knowledge, awareness and attitude of Italian Pediatric Health Care Professionals (pHCPs) on vaccinations. METHODS: An anonymous on-line questionnaire was developed within the Vaccine Committee of Italian Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology (SIAIP) and spontaneously completed by 231 Pediatricians and Pediatric Nurses (PN). RESULTS: An accurate vaccine education was reported by 70% of pediatricians and 13% of PN but 11% of pediatricians versus 26% of PN consult social media instead of scientific sources for their vaccine update. The investigation on the pHCPs attitudes to vaccination in a personal and family setting highlights poor adherence to vaccinations. Only 63% of pediatricians versus 16% of PN (p < 0.0001) annually received the Flu vaccine. In their family setting 93% of pediatricians versus 51% of PN recommended all vaccinations (p < 0.0001). Anti-flu, anti-rotavirus, anti-zoster and anti-pneumococcal vaccines were not regularly recommended by all pHCPs due to doubts of uselessness (55% of pediatricians versus 40% of PN) and preference for natural immunity (44% of pediatricians versus 40% of PN).

We therefore propose that the host SUMOylation pathway is a critical host factor for the IBV virus life cycle. The identification and inhibition of critical host factor(s) provide a novel strategy for future anti-viral therapeutics development, such as IBV and other viruses.","output":"Human SUMOylation Pathway Is Critical for Influenza B Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Attenuating the intraoperative stress response is crucial; however, the effect of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) on surgical stress is not completely understood.

Serum cortisol, prolactin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and natural killer (NK) cell percentage were measured before anesthesia induction, 90 min after pneumoperitoneum, operation end (OPEnd), and postoperative day 1. Additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin levels were estimated. Additionally, intraoperative heart rate variability was evaluated. The deep NMB group showed significantly lower levels of low-frequency/high-frequency (HF) ratio at OPEnd compared to the moderate NMB group (1.4  0.2 vs. 2.2  0.3, respectively; Bonferroni corrected p = 0.039). Furthermore, HF power in the deep NMB group was significantly higher at OPEnd than that in the moderate NMB group (45.2  3.6 vs. 33.8  4.0, respectively; Bonferroni corrected p = 0.044).

Regulatory oversight of compounding is piecemeal and compounding errors have resulted in patient harm. We review compounding in the United States (US), including a history of compounding, a critique of current regulatory oversight, and a systematic review of compounding errors recorded in the literature. METHODS: We gathered reports of compounding errors occurring in the US from 1990 to 2020 from PubMed, Embase, several relevant conference abstracts, and the US Food and Drug Administration Drug Alerts and Statements repository. We categorized reports into errors of contamination, suprapotency, and subpotency. Errors were also subdivided by whether they resulted in morbidity and mortality. We reported demographic, medication, and outcome data where available. RESULTS: We screened 2155 reports and identified 63 errors. Twenty-one of 63 were errors of concentration, harming 36 patients. Twenty-seven of 63 were contamination errors, harming 1119 patients. Fifteen errors did not result in any identified harm. DISCUSSION: Compounding errors are attributed to contamination or concentration. Concentration errors predominantly result from compounding a prescription for a single patient, and disproportionately affect children. Contamination errors largely occur during bulk distribution of compounded medications for parenteral use, and affect more patients. The burden falls on the government, pharmacy industry, and medical providers to reduce the risk of patient harm caused by compounding errors. CONCLUSION: In the US, drug compounding is important in ensuring access to vital medications, but has the potential to cause patient harm without adequate safeguards.","output":"Pharmaceutical Compounding: a History, Regulatory Overview, and Systematic Review of Compounding Errors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematical models are key actors in policy and public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The use of costly deuterated lipids is thus required to replace non-deuterated ones. With conventional methods, detergents like dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) cannot be fully exchanged due to their high binding affinity to hydrophobic proteins. We propose an original and simple protocol which combines the use of acetonitrile, dialysis and lyophilization to disrupt the binding of lipids to the protein and allow their indirect replacement by their deuterated equivalents, while maintaining the native structure of the protein. Moreover, by this protocol, the detergent-to-protein molar ratio can be controlled as it challenges the protein structure. This protocol was applied to solubilize the Vpx protein that was followed upon addition of DPC-d38 by 1 H-15 N SOFAST-HMQC spectra and the best detergent-to-DSPs molar ratio was obtained for structural studies.

We hypothesized that patients with dilated pancreatic ducts have improved postoperative outcomes with MIPD compared to OPD. METHODS: All patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy were prospectively followed over a time period of 47 months, and perioperative and pathologic covariates and outcomes were compared. Ideal outcome after PD was defined as follows: (1) no complications, (2) postoperative length of stay < 7 days, and (3) negative (R0) margins on pathology. Patients with dilated pancreatic ducts ( 3 mm) who underwent MIPD were 1:3 propensity score-matched to patients with dilated ducts who underwent OPD and outcomes compared. Likewise, patients with non-dilated pancreatic ducts (< 3 mm) who underwent MIPD were 1:3 propensity score-matched to patients with non-dilated ducts who underwent OPD and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: 371 patients underwent PD74 (19.9%) MIPD and 297 (80.1%) underwent OPD. Overall, patients who underwent MIPD had significantly less intraoperative blood loss. After 1:3 propensity score matching, patients with dilated pancreatic ducts who underwent MIPD (n = 45) had significantly lower overall complication and 90-day readmission rates compared to matched OPD patients (n = 135) with dilated ducts. Patients with dilated duct who underwent MIPD were more likely to have an ideal outcome than patients with OPD (29 vs 15%, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in postoperative outcomes among propensity score-matched patients with non-dilated pancreatic ducts who underwent MIPD (n = 29) compared to matched patients undergoing OPD (n = 87) with non-dilated ducts. CONCLUSIONS: MIPD is safe with comparable perioperative outcomes to OPD. Patients with pancreatic ducts  3 mm appear to derive the most benefit from MIPD in terms of fewer complications, lower readmission rates, and higher likelihood of ideal outcome.

The central nervous system (CNS) is unique in that cells resident in the parenchyma, glia and neurons, do not constitutively (or very sparsely at best) express MHC molecules (Aloisi et al., 2000; Sedgwick and Hickey, 1997; Xiao and Link, 1998), making them invisible to T cells. Additional restrictions on T cell surveillance are imposed by the absence of classical lymphatic drainage, the bloodbrain barrier (BBB), and the unique anatomy of the brain microvasculature (Bechmann et al., 2007; Galea et al., 2007; Hickey, 2001; Xiao and Link, 1998; Lowenstein, 2002). Infiltrating cells not only have to cross the vascular wall to penetrate into the perivascular space, but more importantly overcome the barrier formed by the glia limitans to access the CNS parenchyma. While the first step is generally not associated with pathology, penetration from the perivascular space of postcapillary venules into the parenchyma is more restricted and once overcome, associated with clinical consequences (Bechmann et al., 2007). In the resting state, perivascular macrophages are maintained by replacement with circulating monocytes. However the glial limitans is not breached, and thus, these cells are considered to be located outside the confines of the BBB. While diffusion of soluble factors and antibodies is restricted by the BBB, especially by the tight, continuous, unfenestrated capillary epithelium, leukocyte infiltration preferentially occurs at distal sites in postcapillary venules (Bechmann et al., 2007). BBB permeability and leukocyte infiltration are thus not necessarily functionally nor physically linked. The barriers separating CNS parenchyma from the circulation explains the rare presence of T cells in the normal CNS parenchyma, despite the ability of peripherally activated and memory T cells to traffic to non lymphoid tissues independent of antigen presentation (Masopust et al., 2004). Nevertheless, T cells activated during an infection or auto-immune response, are able to enter into, and migrate within the brain parenchyma, even in the presence of an intact, non-inflamed BBB (Cabarrocas et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2005; Evans et al., 1996; Hickey, 2001). However, although entry of activated T cells into the CNS is independent of their antigen specificity, only those T cells that recognize antigen are retained. Thus, barriers limiting T cell surveillance of the brain are rapidly overcome following CNS infections and other inflammatory conditions (Griffin, 2003; Ransohoff et al., 2003). Under such conditions, it is also likely that a number of non-activated, bystander T cells, as well as other leukocytes, including B cells are able to penetrate into the brain parenchyma. Mechanisms propagating protective versus pathogenic potential of T cells in varying disease models are complex and require more in depth exploration.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the analysis assesses the effect of gender, age, neoplasm, and the main chronic diseases on the onset of an infection with at least mild symptoms by calculating odds ratios (OR) by multivariate logistic regression models (to produce adjusted OR by potential confounders). RESULTS among the 1,840 cases, compared to the general population, the presence of males and over-60-year-old people is greater. Almost all the considered chronic diseases are more frequent among the cases, compared to the general population. A chronic patient has a 68% greater risk to be positive with at least mild symptoms.

Systematic literature reviews were conducted for each PICO question. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation method to assess the quality of evidence and formulate recommendations. Each recommendation required consensus from at least 70% of the Voting Panel. RESULTS We present 1 good practice statement, 11 recommendations, and 1 ungraded position statement to guide the management of KD and clinical scenarios of suspected KD. These recommendations for KD are focused on situations in which input from rheumatologists may be requested by other managing specialists, such as in cases of treatment-refractory, severe, or complicated KD. The good practice statement affirms that all patients with KD should receive initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). In addition, we developed 7 strong and 4 conditional recommendations for the management of KD or suspected KD. Strong recommendations include prompt treatment of incomplete KD, treatment with aspirin, and obtaining an echocardiogram in the setting of unexplained macrophage activation syndrome or shock. Conditional recommendations include use of IVIG with other adjuvant agents for patients with KD and high-risk features of IVIG resistance and/or coronary artery aneurysms.

This entry not only revisits the science of soil quality determination but also explicates on intricacies of monitoring using big data generated continuously and integrated using the internet of things. Indeed, relaying credible soil quality information especially for heterogeneous soils at field scale is constrained by challenges ranging from data artifacts and acquisition timing differences, vague baselines, validation challenges, scarcity of robust standard algorithms, and decision support tools. With the advent of digital technology, modern communication networks, and advancement in variable rate technologies (VRT), a new era has dawned for developing automated scalable and synthesized soil quality metrics. However, before digital technology becomes the routine tool for soil quality sensing and monitoring, there is need to understand the issues and concerns. This contribution not only exemplifies a unique application of digital technology to detect residue cover but also deliberates on the following questions: (1) is digital agriculture the missing link for integrating, understanding the interconnectivity, and ascertaining the provenance between soil quality, agronomic production, environmental health, and climate dynamics? and (2) what are the technological gaps?

This study aimed to identify potential risk factors for mortality in older patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on admission, which may help identify those with poor prognosis at an early stage. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. SETTING: Fever ward of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 60 years or older with COVID-19 (n = 244) were included, of whom 123 were discharged and 121 died in hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Data retrieved from electronic medical records regarding symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings on admission, and final outcomes of all older patients with COVID-19, were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors for death. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that several clinical characteristics and laboratory variables were significantly different (ie, P < .05) between discharged and deceased patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte (LYM) count (odds ratio [OR] = 0.009; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.001-0.138; P = .001) and older age (OR = 1.122; 95% CI = 1.007-1.249; P = .037) were independently associated with hospital mortality. White blood cell count was also an important risk factor (P = .052). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the logistic regression model was 0.913. Risk factors for in-hospital death were similar between older men and women. CONCLUSION: Older age and lower LYM count on admission were associated with death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Currently, most of the evidence relates to patients in intensive care units; however, there is little information on patients admitted to hospital wards and there is no consensus protocol on thromboprophylaxis during admission and after discharge. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients admitted with COVID-19 and 30 days after discharge. METHOD: A prospective observational study was conducted of patients admitted with COVID-19 in which the hospital thromboprophylaxis protocol was applied, classifying the patients as having a standard or high risk of thrombosis. Pharmacists performed a daily follow-up and actively intervened during admission and at discharge. The main outcome measure was the global incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) related to hospitalisation. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were included, 98.23% of whom were admitted to a hospital ward. The incidence of hospital-acquired VTE was 1.77%. In 75.22% of the subjects, thromboprophylaxis was adjusted to the protocol during admission. A total of 23 pharmaceutical interventions were conducted, with an adherence of 52.17%. At discharge, 94.28% of the patients who had no haemorrhage and 4 points on the Padua Prediction Score required thromboprophylaxis, aligning with the protocol. The global incidence of haemorrhagic events during the follow-up period was 0.88%. CONCLUSION: The incidence of hospital-acquired VTE was lower than that described in the literature. Although it cannot be certain that it is directly related to the instituted protocol, the data can show that the management of prevention of VTE is being optimally performed at the hospital. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the incidence after discharge, as well as to agree on a specific protocol in the COVID-19 population for the prevention of these events during hospitalisation and post-discharge.","output":"Effectiveness of antithrombotic prophylaxis in hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant morbidity and mortality in people who inject drugs (PWID). Upper extremity soft tissue infections are frequently associated with intravenous drug use (IVDU) due to poor compliance with aseptic technique. In Canada, multiple safe injection sites providing clean injection supplies closed, leaving many PWID with no alternatives to inject safely. It was hypothesized that these closures will correspond with increased morbidity and mortality among PWID. The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of upper extremity infections in PWID. METHODS This was a retrospective chart review study. The primary outcome of interest was the frequency of upper extremity infections in PWID. Data were filtered to include only those patients presenting to the emergency department between March to June of 2019 and 2020. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare the number of IVDU patients among patients with upper extremity skin infections between these time periods. RESULTS The number of IVDU patients treated for upper extremity infections in Hamilton significantly increased during the pandemic, relative risk = 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-2.9, P = .0012,) while total upper extremity infections numbers have decreased overall. During the pandemic, PWID made up a larger proportion of upper extremity infections (2 = 10.444, P = .00123). Demographic data such as age and sex of IVDU patients presenting with upper extremity infection was not significantly affected by the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The effect of the pandemic on accessing harm reduction services has led to evident increases in morbidity as described by this study.

This cross-sectional study was conducted on a statistical sample of pregnant women in southwestern Iran between March and April 2020 to evaluate their knowledge and attitude toward this condition. So, pregnant mothers registered in antenatal clinics affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were called and asked to fill in a three-part online questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, obstetric/medical history, and knowledge/attitude toward COVID-19. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The mean score of knowledge among 540 respondents was 34 (4.1) out of 43. Also, 44.3% answered more than 80% of the items correctly. Higher knowledge scores were accordingly associated with marriage duration, area of residence, health insurance coverage, socioeconomic status (SES), and self-rated health status. However, a strong relationship was found between knowledge, SES, and health insurance coverage with reference to multivariate analysis results.

The motivation of this study is to design an automated system that can assist medical staff especially in areas where trained staff are outnumbered. The study investigates the potential of transfer learning-based models for automatically diagnosing diseases like COVID-19 to assist the medical force, especially in times of an outbreak. In the proposed work, a deep learning model, i.e., truncated VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group from Oxford) is implemented to screen COVID-19 CT scans. The VGG16 architecture is fine-tuned and used to extract features from CT scan images. Further principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature selection. For the final classification, four different classifiers, namely deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential ELM, and bagging ensemble with support vector machine (SVM) are compared. The best performing classifier bagging ensemble with SVM within 385 ms achieved an accuracy of 95.7%, the precision of 95.8%, area under curve (AUC) of 0.958, and an F1 score of 95.3% on 208 test images.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in a domiciliary setting can help prevent admissions, but the economic evidence to support NIV use is limited. METHODS A Markov model-based cost-utility analysis from the UK National Health Service perspective compared the cost-effectiveness of domiciliary NIV with usual care for two end-stage COPD populations; a stable COPD population commencing treatment with no recent hospital admission; and a posthospital population starting treatment following admission to hospital for an exacerbation. Hospitalisation rates in patients receiving domiciliary NIV compared with usual care were derived from randomised controlled studies in a recent systematic review. Other model parameters were updated with recent evidence. RESULTS At the threshold of 20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) domiciliary NIV is 99.9% likely cost-effective in a posthospital population, but unlikely (4%) to be cost-effective in stable populations. The incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) was 11 318/QALY gained in the posthospital population and 27 380/QALY gained in the stable population. Cost-effectiveness estimates were sensitive to longer-term readmission and mortality risks, and duration of benefit from NIV. Indeed, for stable Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) for stage 4 patients, or with higher mortality and exacerbation risks, ICERs were close to the 20 000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSION Domiciliary NIV is likely cost-effective for posthospitalised patients, with uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness of domiciliary NIV in stable patients with COPD on which further research should focus.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of domiciliary non-invasive ventilation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some Preemies All Preemies Will spend weeks in the hospital Will have lifelong health problems Are disadvantaged from birth Face health risks Deserve appropriate health coverage Need access to proper health care Even if preterm babies don't require NICU care, they can still face health challenges.

Therefore, evaluating the role of FDQ in successfully treating patients with COVID-19 is crucial. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, 355 consecutive patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia between January 15 and February 18, 2020 were included;among them, 213 received FDQ. Data on the demographic characteristics, length of hospitalizations, symptoms at admission and discharge, adverse events, and laboratory parameters were analyzed. Results In contrast to patients who received FDQ, 12 patients who did not receive FDQ (8.45%) developed severe conditions, and one of them died. Furthermore, FDQ treatment was associated with a shortened duration of hospitalization (18.2 vs. 22.1 days, P < 0.0001), even in elderly patients aged > 60 years (18.0 days vs. 26.1 days, P < 0.0001).

METHODS A three-dimensional anatomically realistic computation aneurysm model was created from the digital subtraction angiogram of a large internal carotid artery-ophthalmic artery aneurysm which could have been treated with either a neck bridging stent or a flow diversion stent. Three-dimensional computational models of the Neuroform EZ neck bridging stent and Pipeline embolization device were created based on measurements with a stereo-microscope. Each stent was placed in the computational aneurysm model and intra-aneurysmal flow structures were compared before and after placement of the stents. Computational fluid dynamics were performed by numerically solving the continuity and Navier-Stokes momentum equations for a steady blood flow based on the finite volume method. Blood was assumed as an incompressible Newtonian fluid. Vessel walls were assumed to be rigid, and no-slip boundary conditions were applied at the lumens. To estimate the change in the intra-aneurysmal pressures we assumed that, at the inlets, the intra-arterial pressure at peak systole was 120 mm Hg both before and after stent placement RESULTS Without any stent, the blood flow entered into the aneurysm dome from the mid to proximal neck area and ascended along the distal wall of the aneurysm. The flow then changed its direction anteriorly and moved along the proximal wall of the aneurysm dome. In addition to the primary intra-aneurysmal circulation pattern, a counterclockwise vortex was observed in the aneurysm dome. The placement of a Neuroform EZ stent induced a mean reduction in flow velocity of 14% and a small change in the overall intra-aneurysmal flow pattern. The placement of a Pipeline device induced a mean reduction in flow velocity of 74% and a significant change in flow pattern. Despite the flow velocity changes, Neuroform EZ and Pipeline devices induced reductions in intra-aneurysmal pressure of only 4 mm Hg and 8 mm Hg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The flow diversion effects of both stents were limited to flow velocity reduction. In a non-thrombosed aneurysm or an aneurysm with delayed thrombosis, the intra-aneurysmal pressure remains essentially unchanged regardless of the level of the intra-aneurysmal flow velocity reduction induced by the stents.","output":"Intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic alterations by a self-expandable intracranial stent and flow diversion stent: high intra-aneurysmal pressure remains regardless of flow velocity reduction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients often do not disclose domestic violence (DV) to healthcare providers in emergency departments and other healthcare settings.

From 10/2018-2/2020, we conducted this survey study at two urban emergency departments (EDs) in California. Participants, enrolled by convenience sampling, responded to survey questions adapted from a previously published survey instrument that was developed to assess undocumented immigrant fears of accessing ED care. Our primary outcomes were the proportions of UDLI, LLRC and NLRC who knew of someone who had experienced DV in the past year, whether these DV victims were afraid to access ED care, reasons DV victims were afraid to access ED care, and rates of misconceptions (defined according to current California law) about the consequences of disclosing DV to healthcare providers. Of 667 patients approached, 531 (80%) agreed to participate: 32% UDLI, 33% LLRC, and 35% NLRC. Of the 27.5% of respondents who knew someone who experienced DV in the past year, 46% stated that the DV victim was afraid to seek ED care; there was no significant difference in this rate between groups. The most common fears reported as barriers to disclosure were fear the doctor would report DV to police (31%) and fear that the person perpetrating DV would find out about the disclosure (30.3%). Contrary to our hypothesis, UDLI had lower rates of misconceptions about healthcare provider and law enforcement responses to DV disclosure than LLRC and NLRC. Fear of disclosing DV and misconceptions about the consequences of disclosure of DV to healthcare providers were common, indicating a need for provider, patient, and community education and changes that lower barriers to help-seeking.","output":"Fears of disclosure and misconceptions regarding domestic violence reporting amongst patients in two US emergency departments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tubuloreticular inclusions (TRIs) are subcellular structures located within the cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum. Formation of TRIs has been linked to the exposure of excess interferon (IFN), either from endogenous or exogenous sources.

Case reports of patients with renal biopsies showing TRIs without underlying SLE or HIV are infrequent in adults, and to our knowledge none have been reported in children. We report 3 pediatric cases in which the renal biopsy showed TRIs on electron microscopy without underlying SLE or HIV infection. The first patient presented at 2 years of age with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. His renal biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and TRIs. The second patient presented at 6 months of age with infantile nephrotic syndrome, and his renal biopsy revealed membranous glomerulopathy and TRIs. The last patient presented at 4 years of age with acute kidney injury of unclear etiology leading to chronic kidney disease. Her biopsy revealed acute and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with TRIs. Despite extensive evaluation in all 3 patients, including testing for HIV infection and SLE, we could not identify an underlying etiology to explain the presence of TRIs.

Cancer therapeutics, including chemo-radiation triggers toxicity effects through damaging mitochondria, primarily through the upregulation of mtROS production leading to subsequent mtDNA and telomeric DNA damage elicitng DNA damage responses (DDR). The ultimate goal of this review is to highlight the new concept of senescence-associated stemness that is induced by cancer treatment and its adverse effects on the vascular system. We will describe how chemo-radiation exerts toxicity effects by simultaneously producing reactive oxygen species in mitochondria and promoting DDR in the nucleus. We discuss the potential of clinical targeting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase which might prevent downstream mitochondrial dysfunction and confer protection to cancer survivors. Overall we emphasize the importance of recognizing the consequences of cardio-toxic effects of several cancer treatments and therefore developing personalized therapeutic approaches to screen for inflammatory and cardiac testing for better patient survival.","output":"Mitochondria and chronic effects of cancer therapeutics: The clinical implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 (AdH5) vectors can induce strong transgene product-specific cellular and humoral responses. However, many adult humans have neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against AdH5 as a result of natural infection with this virus. Therefore, a chimpanzee adenovirus C7 (AdC7) vector was developed to circumvent interference by preexisting immunity to AdH5. This study evaluated the impact of preexisting immunity to human adenovirus on the efficacy of adenovirus-based vaccines against the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). Efficacy was assessed after intramuscular injection of the vector into mice and was measured as the frequency of SARS-CoV-specific T cells and NAbs against SARS-CoV. Immunogenicity of the AdH5-based vaccine was significantly attenuated or completely abolished when the preexisting anti-AdH5 NAb titer was higher than 40. Because 27% of human serum samples from the United States tested so far have an anti-AdH5 NAb titer higher than 40, our results suggested that a significant percentage of humans with preexisting anti-AdH5 immunity would not be candidates for vaccination with an AdH5-based genetic vaccine. In contrast, preexisting anti-AdH5 NAbs have a minimal effect on the potency of the AdC7-based genetic vaccine. Taken together, our studies warrant the further development of AdC7 as a vaccine carrier for human trials.","output":"Efficacy of severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine based on a nonhuman primate adenovirus in the presence of immunity against human adenovirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of gamification is garnering attention as a method that promotes sustainable learning during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era This study investigates the effect that gamified online learning has on student learning and has utilized a gamified online learning program to examine the impact To determine the programs effectiveness, a study has been conducted with 140 elementary and middle school students A previously developed survey instrument was used to measure the results The studys findings suggest that gamification in online learning has a positive impact on learner motivation and the understanding of the educational content Based on the findings, this study proposes that gamification should be used as a sustainable method to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) of ensuring quality education","output":"Is Sustainable Online Learning Possible with Gamification?The Effect of Gamified Online Learning on Student Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent U S in-restaurant dining restrictions deleteriously affected the restaurant industry While dining restrictions were adopted to prevent human contact, evidence suggests that consumers may mistakenly perceive that restaurant \\"food\\" and its \\"packaging\\" are risky sources of COVID-19 To explore consumers?

METHODS: Hospitalized children <18 years of age with suspected COVID-19 (N=53) were recruited into a prospective cohort study; 32 had confirmed COVID-19, with 16 meeting the U.S. Centers for Disease Control criteria for MIS-C. Differences in nasopharyngeal viral RNA levels, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, and cytokine/chemokine profiles were examined, including after adjustments for age and sex. RESULTS: The median ages for those with and without MIS-C were 8.7 years (IQR 5.5-13.9) and 2.2 years (IQR 1.1-10.5), respectively, (p=0.18) and nasopharyngeal levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA did not differ significantly between the two groups (median 63,848.25 copies/mL versus 307.1 copies/mL, p= 0.66); 75% of those with MIS-C were antibody positive compared to 44% without, p=0.026.

However, the number of COVID-19 deaths reported from death certificates is likely to represent an underestimate of the total deaths related to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Estimating those deaths not captured through death certificates is important to understanding the full burden of COVID-19 on mortality. In this work, we explored enhancements to an existing approach by employing Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate unrecognized deaths attributed to COVID-19 using weekly state-level COVID-19 viral surveillance and mortality data in the United States from March 2020 to April 2021. We demonstrated our model using those aged [Formula: see text] years who died. First, we used a spatialCtemporal binomial regression model to estimate the percent of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. A spatialCtemporal negative-binomial model was then used to estimate unrecognized COVID-19 deaths by exploiting the spatialCtemporal association between SARS-CoV-2 percent positive and all-cause mortality counts using an excess mortality approach. Computationally efficient Bayesian inference was accomplished via the Polya-Gamma representation of the binomial and negative-binomial models. Among those aged [Formula: see text] years, we estimated 58,200 (95% CI: 51,300, 64,900) unrecognized COVID-19 deaths, which accounts for 26% (95% CI: 24%, 29%) of total COVID-19 deaths in this age group.

We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading.

Heart-lung-machines may potentially be used for ECMO but contain roller pumps as compared to centrifugal pumps in ECMO-circuits. We here tested roller pumps as rescue pump for ECMO-establishment. METHODS: We set up in vitro circuits on roller pumps from C5 heart-lung-machine with 5 l/minutes flow. In two series, we placed either PVC or silicon tubing for an ECMO circuit into the roller pump. We assessed the mechanical stress on the tubing (aiming to run the pump for at least 1 week), measured the temperature increase generated by the friction and assessed flow characteristics and its measurement in simulated situations resembling tube kinking and suction. RESULTS: The roller pumps led to expected and unexpected adverse events. PVC tubing burst between 36 and 78 hours, while silicon tubing lasted for at least 7 days. At 7 days, the silicone tubing showed significant signs of roller pump wear visible on the outside. The inside, however, was free of surface irregularities. Using these tubings in a roller pump led to a remarkable increase in circuit temperature (PVC: +12.0C, silicone +2.9C). Kinking or suction on the device caused the expected dramatic flow reduction (as assessed by direct measurement) while the roller pump display continued to show the preset flow. The roller pump is therefore not able to reliably determine the true flow rate. CONCLUSION: Roller pumps with silicone tubing but not PVC tubing may be used for running ECMO circuits. Silicone tubing may endure the roller pump shear forces for up to 1 week. Thus, repeated tubing repositioning may be a solution. Circuit heating and substantial limitations in flow detection should increase attention if clinical use in situations of crisis is considered.","output":"Using a roller pump for establishing extra-corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) - technical considerations for times of crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether physical activity (PA) increases were responsible for the improvements in mental health and quality of life (QOL) seen among adolescents who returned to sport during the COVID-19 pandemic.Adolescent athletes were asked to complete a survey in October 2020 regarding demographic information, whether they had returned to sport participation (no [DNP], yes [PLY]), school instruction type (virtual, in-person, hybrid), anxiety, depression, QOL, and PA.

Many of the critically ill COVID-19 patients are in a hypercoagulable procoagulant state and at high risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation, thromboembolism, and thrombotic multi-organ failure, another cause of high fatality. It is not yet clear whether IV infusion is a safe and effective route of MSC delivery in COVID-19, since MSC-based products express variable levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142), compromising the cells' hemocompatibility and safety profile. Of concern, IV infusions of poorly characterized MSC products with unchecked (high) TF/CD142 expression could trigger blood clotting in COVID-19 and other vulnerable patient populations and further promote the risk for thromboembolism. In contrast, well-characterized products with robust manufacturing procedures and optimized modes of clinical delivery hold great promise for ameliorating COVID-19 by exerting their beneficial immunomodulatory effects, inducing tissue repair and organ protection. While the need for MSC therapy in COVID-19 is apparent, integrating both innate and adaptive immune compatibility testing into the current guidelines for cell, tissue, and organ transplantation is critical for safe and effective therapies. It is paramount to only use well-characterized, safe MSCs even in the most urgent and experimental treatments.

The aim of our study was to compare outcomes for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy with laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy were prospectively entered into an institutional review board-approved database. Those that underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomy were case matched for sex, age, disease, surgery, body mass index, previous surgeries, and surgeon with patients undergoing LAC. RESULTS Twenty-nine single-incision laparoscopic segmental colectomies were performed for polyps (4), adenocarcinoma (12), diverticulitis (6), and Crohn's disease (7) and were case matched to laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for the same indications. Mean body mass index was 28.8  3 kg/m2. Operative time was longer for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (134.4  40 vs 103.8  54 min; P = .0002). Four single-incision laparoscopic colectomies were converted to LAC requiring either one extra port (2) or 2 extra ports (2), and there was one conversion to laparotomy.

Compared to non-SGM respondents, a greater proportion of SGM participants reported mental health and substance use impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including deterioration in mental health, poor coping, suicidal thoughts, self-harm, alcohol and cannabis use, and use of substances to cope. Among SGM respondents, various risk factors, including having a pre-existing mental health condition, were identified as associated with mental health and substance use impacts. These widening inequities demonstrate the need for tailored public mental health actions during and beyond the pandemic.","output":"Widening mental health and substance use inequities among sexual and gender minority populations: Findings from a repeated cross-sectional monitoring survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic in which aerosol and droplet transmission is possible, the demand for masks that meet medical or workplace standards can prevent most individuals or organizations from obtaining suitable protection. Cloth masks are widely believed to impede droplet and aerosol transmission but most are constructed from materials with unknown filtration efficiency, airflow resistance and water resistance. Further, there has been no clear guidance on the most important performance metrics for the materials used by the general public (as opposed to high-risk healthcare settings). Here we provide data on a range of common fabrics that might be used to construct masks. None of the materials were suitable for masks meeting the N95 NIOSH standard, but many could provide useful filtration (>90%) of 3 micron particles (a plausible challenge size for human generated aerosols), with low pressure drop. These were: nonwoven sterile wraps, dried baby wipes and some double-knit cotton materials. Decontamination of N95 masks using isopropyl alcohol produces the expected increase in particle penetration, but for 3 micron particles, filtration efficiency is still well above 95%. Tightly woven thin fabrics, despite having the visual appearance of a good particle barrier, had remarkably low filtration efficiency and high pressure drop. These differences in filtration performance can be partly explained by the material structure; the better structures expose individual fibers to the flow while the poor materials may have small fundamental fibers but these are in tightly bundled yarns. The fit and use of the whole mask are critical factors not addressed in this work. Despite the complexity of the design of a very good mask, it is clear that for the larger aerosol particles, any mask will provide substantial protection to the wearer and those around them.","output":"Properties of materials considered for improvised masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to assess safety and efficacy of pre-operative assessment for internal mucosal rectal prolapse (IMRP) in internal hemorrhoids, in order to achieve a tailored transanal stapled surgery.

Auto Suture stapler (Covidien) were included in the present study. RESULTS A total of 100 consecutive patients (38 females) were enrolled in the study. Preoperative Visual Analogue Scale pain assessment was 7.332.68. The mean duration of the procedure was 34.117.8 min, and the median hospital stay was 2 days (range 2-6).

We aimed to analyze the prevalence of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) in Covid-19 patients treated in intensive care unit and whether treatment of it would create any survival benefit. Methods: A total of 119 Covid-19 patients in intensive care unit were enrolled into the study. All patients received treatment for Covid-19 according to national guideline including hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, antibiotics including azithromycin and oseltamivir in some patients. Basal cortisol below 10 g/dl were accepted as CIRCI and above 34 g/dl as intact HPA axis. Patients between them were introduced 1 g cosynthropin stimulation test and delta cortisol below 9 g/dl were also accepted as CIRCI. All patients who got diagnosis received hydrocortisone 300 mg/day until clinical condition stabilized. Mortality rate was recorded, then. Results: CIRCI was detected in 50.4% of cases and mean plasma ACTH level was 14.86.0 pg/ml. Patients below age 65 had a statistically higher risk (63.4 % vs. 40.2%, p=0.012). Presence of comorbidity did not increase the risk of CIRCI (47.3% vs. 62.5%, p=0.18). Also, severity of pulmonary involvement and intubation did not increase the risk of CIRCI.

SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading infectious disease with a high mortality rate. The disease has a moderate and severe course in approximately 20% of the patients and mortality reaches up to 62% among these patients(2). The majority of the patients develop SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia and manifestations of pneumonia rapidly progress to respiratory failure. In severe Covid pneumonia, it has been demonstrated that increased plasma concentrations of cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-12 are involved in immune response and in cytokine storm caused by the increase in these cytokines lead to mortality(1, 3). Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a promising agent that is used for the treatment of cytokine storm. TCZ is an IgG1 class recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor(3). It has then been used for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Due to its mechanism of action, TCZ treatment comes to the forefront particularly in cases of severe COVID-19-induced cytokine pneumonia presenting with cytokine storm(3). However, potential IgE-mediated immunological reactions against this drug, especially anaphylaxis, may deprive these patients of an important treatment option for the treatment of COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. Although TCZ-induced anaphylaxis has been reported as case reports of indicated rheumatic diseases, TCZ-induced anaphylaxis has not yet been reported in patients using TCZ for SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storms(4).

Methods: We led molecular investigations on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples from the 1161 first suspected cases of COVID-19. We diagnosed the first case of COVID-19 on March, 12 2020. Results: Among those suspected cases, 83 were confirmed cases. There was no significant difference in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 between age groups (p=0.14). 73% were asymptomatic. The viral loads were significantly higher in the nasopharyngeal samples than in the oropharyngeal samples (p=0.03).

A crucial step in the treatment of tuberculosis is screening high risk populations and the early detection of the disease, with chest x-ray (CXR) imaging being the most widely-used imaging modality. As such, there has been significant recent interest in artificial intelligence-based TB screening solutions for use in resource-limited scenarios where there is a lack of trained healthcare workers with expertise in CXR interpretation. Motivated by this pressing need and the recent recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the use of computer-aided diagnosis of TB in place of a human reader, we introduce TB-Net, a self-attention deep convolutional neural network tailored for TB case screening. We used CXR data from a multi-national patient cohort to train and test our models. A machine-driven design exploration approach leveraging generative synthesis was used to build a highly customized deep neural network architecture with attention condensers. We conducted an explainability-driven performance validation process to validate TB-Net's decision-making behavior. Experiments on CXR data from a multi-national patient cohort showed that the proposed TB-Net is able to achieve accuracy/sensitivity/specificity of 99.86/100.0/99.71%. Radiologist validation was conducted on select cases by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 19 years of experience, respectively, and showed consistency between radiologist interpretation and critical factors leveraged by TB-Net for TB case detection for the case where radiologists identified anomalies. The proposed TB-Net not only achieves high tuberculosis case detection performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, but also leverages clinically relevant critical factors in its decision making process. While not a production-ready solution, we hope that the open-source release of TB-Net as part of the COVID-Net initiative will support researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists in advancing this field in the fight against this global public health crisis.","output":"TB-Net: A Tailored, Self-Attention Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for Detection of Tuberculosis Cases From Chest X-Ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to examine the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the general population of the multi-ethnic nation of Singapore as part of the Knowledge, Practice and Attitudes towards Diabetes study, a cross-sectional and population-based survey. It also examined the relationship between physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). METHODS: Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were assessed via the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), while physical and mental HRQoL was assessed via the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12v2). Survey weights were employed to account for complex survey design. Multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to examine sociodemographic correlates of physical activity (insufficient vs. sufficient physical activity) and sedentary behaviour (< 7 h/day vs 7 h/day). Descriptive statistics were calculated to examine the percentage of time spent in different domains of physical activity. Multivariable linear regressions were conducted to examine the association between physical activity and sedentary behaviour with physical and mental HRQoL. RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred sixty seven participants recruited from February 2019 to March 2020 (prior to COVID-19 lockdown and related restrictions in Singapore) were included in the analyses. 83.3% of respondents had sufficient physical activity. Age (65 years and above) and income (SGD 2000 to 3999) were associated with a higher likelihood of insufficient physical activity. In contrast, those of Malay ethnicity and having one chronic physical condition were associated with a lower likelihood of insufficient physical activity. 47.7% reported that they had sedentary behaviour of 7 h/day. Older age and a primary school education were related to a lower likelihood of sedentary behaviour, while being single, having higher income, obesity, and multimorbidity were associated with higher sedentary behaviour. Insufficient physical activity was significantly associated with lower physical HRQoL but was not significantly associated with mental HRQoL. Sedentary behaviour was not significantly associated with mental or physical HRQoL. CONCLUSION: About 17% of the population did not meet the minimum requirements for physical activity, while around half of the population spent a considerable time being sedentary. As insufficient physical activity was associated with poorer physical HRQoL, policymakers should promote moderate physical activity and encouraging the breaking up of prolonged sedentary periods within the middle- and high-income groups, especially at the workplace. Increased leisure-time exercise should be encouraged for those in the lower- income group.

Materials and MethodsObservational prospective study of a HD group followed in a Portuguese Public Founded Hemodialysis Center who received BNT-162b2 vaccination. Specific anti-Spike IgG was evaluated as arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) on two separate occasions: 3 weeks after the first dose and 3 weeks after the second. IgG titers, Non-Responders (NR), and Weak-Responders (WR) after each dose were evaluated against risk factors that included demographic, clinical and analytical variables. ResultsHumoral response evaluated by IgG anti-Spike levels showed a strong correlation with Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and intact parathormone (iPTH) after each inoculation (1st dose: {rho}=-0.64/0.54; 2nd dose: {rho}=-0.66/0.63, respectively; p<0.01 throughout). After completing both doses: 1) NR were associated with female sex (p<0.01), lower albumin and iPTH (p=0.01); 2) WR showed higher CCI, older age, lower iPTH and lower albumin (p=<0.01, p=0.03, p<0.01, p=0.05, respectively) and, consistently, associated with CCI over 8, age over 75, iPTH under 150 ng/L, female sex, dialysis vintage under 24 months and central venous catheter (CVC) over arteriovenous fistula (p=0.01, p=0.03, p<0.01, p=0.01, p=0.01, p<0.01, respectively). A binary regression model using CCI, sex (male) and CVC was statistically significant in prediction of WR after the 2nd dose with OR (95% CI): 1.81 (1.06-3.08); 0.05 (0.01-0.65); 13.55 (1.06-174.18), respectively (p=0.01). ConclusionOlder age, higher CCI, lower iPTH and albumin, CVC as vascular access and recent hemodialysis initiation (less than 2 years) associate with lower response to vaccination in our study. A higher comorbidity burden is suggested as a more significant surrogate marker for low immunogenicity rather than age alone.

Pneumonia with lung consolidation was the primary endpoint; complicated pneumonia (bacteremia, empyema, or pleural effusion) was the secondary endpoint. We showed that three clinical signs (unilateral hypoventilation, grunting, and absence of wheezing), elevated procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), negative nasopharyngeal viral PCR, or positive blood pneumococcal PCR (P-PCR) were significantly associated with both pneumonia with consolidation and complicated pneumonia.

The underrepresentation of German twin studies cannot be solely explained by the abuse of medical research under National Socialism. Developing and expanding large twin cohorts is a challenge in terms of both ethics and data protection. However, twin cohorts enable long-term and real-time research on many medical issues and contribute to answer the question of predisposition or environment as possible disease triggers C even after the sequencing of the human genome. There are currently two German twin cohorts: the biomedical cohort HealthTwiSt, with around 1500 pairs of twins, and TwinLife, a sociologicalCpsychological cohort with around 4000 pairs of twins. There are also disease-specific cohorts. The TwinHealth Consortium in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Tbingen was established in 2016 with the aim of enabling open-ended and sustainable twin research in Tbingen to answer various scientific questions. With the help of systematic literature research and medical history, this article gives an overview of the worldwide development of twin studies and databases over the last 100 years.

Currently, the incidence of COVID-19 is growing in many countries of the world, including Russia. There are suggestions about a likely protective role against the new coronavirus infection of widely used traditional vaccines against respiratory infections (influenza, tuberculosis, pneumococcal infection). Those vaccinated with these vaccines are less likely to report deaths and severe forms of COVID-19 diseases in vulnerable populations. The aim is to determine the frequency of detection of positive markers of a new coronavirus infection in individuals with different vaccination histories. Materials and methods. We examined 313 employees of an educational institution with various vaccination histories at the age of 20C54 years from May to September 2020. The determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and specific IgM and IgG antibodies to the virus nucleocapsid was carried out. Results. Positive markers for SARS-CoV-2 (PCR and / or ELISA) were found in 51 (16.3%) people. All examined patients had no signs of acute respiratory viral infections. Among people with positive markers of coronavirus infection (PCR and / or ELISA), the number of people vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, measles and hepatitis B (HBV) was 13.7C17.6% of those examined.

This study therefore aimed to investigate the effects of a surgical, flannel or vertical-fold N95 masks on cardiorespiratory responses to incremental exercise. METHODS: This investigation studied 11 adult males and females at rest and while performing progressive cycle exercise to exhaustion. We tested the hypotheses that wearing a surgical (S), flannel (F) or horizontal-fold N95 mask compared to no mask (control) would not promote arterial deoxygenation or exercise intolerance nor alter primary cardiovascular variables during submaximal or maximal exercise. RESULTS: Despite the masks significantly increasing end-expired peri-oral %CO2 and reducing %O2, each a??0.8-2% during exercise (P < 0.05), our results supported the hypotheses. Specifically, none of these masks reduced sub-maximal or maximal exercise arterial O2 saturation (P = 0.744), but ratings of dyspnea were significantly increased (P = 0.007). Moreover, maximal exercise capacity was not compromised nor were there any significant alterations of primary cardiovascular responses (mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output) found during sub-maximal exercise. CONCLUSION: Whereas these results are for young healthy recreational male and female exercisers and cannot be applied directly to elite athletes, older or patient populations, they do support that arterial hypoxemia and exercise intolerance are not the obligatory consequences of COVID-19-indicated mask-wearing at least for cycling exercise.","output":"Does wearing a facemask decrease arterial blood oxygenation and impair exercise tolerance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus characterized by diarrhea and high morbidity rates, and the mortality rate is 100% in piglets less than 2 weeks old. Pigs infected with TGEV often suffer secondary infection by other pathogens, which aggravates the severity of diarrhea, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that persistent TGEV infection stimulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and thus enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can more easily adhere to generating cells. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary targets of TGEV and ETEC infections. We found that TGEV can persistently infect porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and cause EMT, consistent with multiple changes in key cell characteristics. Infected cells display fibroblast-like shapes; exhibit increases in levels of mesenchymal markers with a corresponding loss of epithelial markers; have enhanced expression levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor  (TGF-), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) mRNAs; and demonstrate increases in migratory and invasive behaviors. Additional experiments showed that the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways via TGF- is critical for the TGEV-mediated EMT process. Cellular uptake is also modified in cells that have undergone EMT. TGEV-infected cells have higher levels of integrin 5 and fibronectin and exhibit enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces ETEC K88 adhesion and inhibits the expression of integrin 5 and fibronectin. Overall, these results suggest that TGEV infection induces EMT in IPEC-J2 cells, increasing the adhesion of ETEC K88 in the intestine and facilitating dual infection.IMPORTANCE Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes pig diarrhea and is often followed by secondary infection by other pathogens. In this study, we showed that persistent TGEV infection induces an EMT in porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and enhances the adhesion of the secondary pathogen ETEC K88. Additional experiments suggest that integrin 5 and fibronectin play an important role in TGEV-enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces the expression of integrin 5 and fibronectin and also reduces ETEC K88 adhesion. We conclude that TGEV infection triggers EMT and facilitates dual infection. Our results provide new insights into secondary infection and suggest that targeted anti-EMT therapy may have implications for the prevention and treatment of secondary infection.","output":"Persistent Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Infection Enhances Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88 Adhesion by Promoting Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Intestinal Epithelial Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical presentation and outcomes of COVID\\\\19 infection during pregnancy remain limited and fragmented.

The objective was to assess whether smoking and e-cigarette use were associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This cohort ran from 24 January 2020 until 30 April 2020 at the height of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in England. It comprised 7 869 534 people representative of the population of England with smoking status, demographic factors and diseases recorded by general practitioners in the medical records, which were linked to hospital and death data. The outcomes were COVID-19-associated hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. The associations between smoking and the outcomes were assessed with Cox proportional hazards models, with sequential adjustment for confounding variables and indirect causal factors (body mass index and smoking-related disease). RESULTS: Compared with never smokers, people currently smoking were at lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalization, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.64 (95% confidence intervals 0.60 to 0.69) for <10 cigarettes/day, 0.49 (0.41 to 0.59) for 10C19 cigarettes/day, and 0.61 (0.49 to 0.74) for 20 cigarettes/day. For ICU admission, the corresponding HRs were 0.31 (0.24 to 0.40), 0.15 (0.06 to 0.36), and 0.35 (0.17 to 0.74) and death were: 0.79 (0.70 to 0.89), 0.66 (0.48 to 0.90), and 0.77 (0.54 to 1.09) respectively. Former smokers were at higher risk of severe COVID-19: HRs: 1.07 (1.03 to 1.11) for hospitalization, 1.17 (1.04 to 1.31) for ICU admission, and 1.17 (1.10 to 1.24) for death. All-cause mortality was higher for current smoking than never smoking, HR 1.42 (1.36 to 1.48).

However, the mechanisms by which the rate of membrane synthesis is coupled with the rate of cell growth remain unresolved. By comparing substrate and enzyme concentrations of the fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis pathways of Escherichia coli across a 3-fold range of carbon-limited growth rates, we show that the rate of membrane phospholipid synthesis during steady-state growth is determined principally through allosteric control of a single enzyme, PlsB. Due to feedback regulation of the fatty acid pathway, PlsB activity also indirectly controls synthesis of lipopolysaccharide, a major component of the outer membrane synthesized from a fatty acid synthesis intermediate. Surprisingly, concentrations of the enzyme that catalyzes the committed step of lipopolysaccharide synthesis (LpxC) do not differ across steady-state growth conditions, suggesting that steady-state lipopolysaccharide synthesis is modulated primarily via indirect control by PlsB. In contrast to steady-state regulation, we found that responses to environmental perturbations are triggered directly via changes in acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) concentrations, which enable rapid adaptation. Adaptations are further modulated by ppGpp, which regulates PlsB activity during slow growth and growth arrest.

Case overview/synopsis: Arun Kumar Patni, 47, and his wife Neelima Patni, 43, are co-founders of Flying Colours, a start-up company based in Jaipur, in the state of Rajasthan, India. Their enterprise was engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of bird products and accessories, including bird feeders, bird houses, earthen water bowls, etc. In July 2020, post-lockdown, they were desperate to hire carpenters to restart their factory. However, COVID-19 posed a serious challenge, making it very difficult to replace their skilled carpenters, who had returned to their native places and had not come back. This disrupted production and order fulfilment. Keeping this situation in perspective in anticipation of the continuing pandemic crisis, Neelima was in favour of outsourcing basic production and designing the birdfeed decoration and artwork in-house. Meanwhile, Arun instead favoured continuing full in-house production as before, by hiring replacement carpenters. Yet for an in-house full-scale production, procuring raw material was a difficult task because of the lockdown. The situation had earlier taken a turn for the worse when Arun had advertised an exchange marketing policy to let customers return their old bird feeders for a 20% discount on a new one. This campaign was a huge success and resulted in a sales spike but unfortunately it caused a huge stock of returned products in their warehouse. Arun initially planned to repair and resell them as refurbished products. It now seemed impossible, because local carpenters demanded higher labour charges than the regular carpenters did. Flying Colours had provided skills workshops and hired external trainers to train unskilled carpenters prior to lockdown, so now all the training investment was in vain.

The purpose of the study is to review the latest available data on COVID-19 treatment using casirivimab and imdevimab. According to recent preclinical studies, the antibody cocktail presents optimal antiviral strength and has the potential to minimize the chances of the virus escaping. It was shown in animal studies that the cocktail reduces the pathological consequences caused by viruses, decreases the number of viruses in the respiratory system, and reduces lung titers and pneumonia symptoms. Casirivimab and imdevimab as a cocktail also prevents the rapid appearance of treatment-resistant mutants. In the clinical trial, REGN-COV-2 decreased viral load, particularly in patients with a non-initiated immune response (serum antibody-negative) and with high viral load at baseline. The adverse effects were comparable in the combined REGN-COV2 dose groups (2.4 g and 8.0 g), as well as in the placebo group. The cocktail caused few and mainly low-grade toxic effects. Casirivimab and imdevimab seem to be effective and safe antiviral therapy for nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19. Further observations and research are extremely necessary to assess the efficacy, security and indications in a wider group of patients.","output":"Casirivimab and imdevimab as investigational monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 patients - Review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article reports on the signs showing a return to normality in England, including the publication by National Health Service (NHS) England and NHS Improvement of the flu vaccination letter for the 2022/2023 season.","output":"The 2022/23 flu vaccination season: a return to normality?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems, at times overwhelming intensive care units (ICUs). We aimed to describe the length and rate of ICU admission, and explore the clinical variables influencing ICU use, for COVID-19 patients with known cardiovascular diseases or their risk factors (CVDRF). Methods and Results: A post hoc analysis was performed of 693 Japanese COVID-19 patients with CVDRF enrolled in the nationwide CLAVIS-COVID registration system between January and May 2020 (mean [SD] age 68.314.9 years; 35% female); 199 patients (28.7%) required ICU management. The mean (SD) ICU length of stay (LOS) was 19.318.5 days, and the rate of in-hospital death and hospital LOS were significantly higher (P<0.001) and longer (P<0.001), respectively, in the ICU than non-ICU group. Logistic regression analysis revealed that clinical variables reflecting impaired general condition (e.g., high C-reactive protein, low Glasgow Coma Scale score, SpO(2), albumin level), male sex, and previous use of -blockers) were associated with ICU admission (all P<0.001). Notably, age was inversely associated with ICU admission, and this was particularly prominent among elderly patients (OR 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.95C0.99; P=0.0018). Conclusions: One-third of COVID patients with CVDRF required ICU care during the first phase of the pandemic in Japan.

Moreover, they rarely have the opportunity to participate in stress management trainings. Therefore, KMU-GO (ger: Kleine und mittlere Unternehmen C Gesundheitsoffensive; en: small and medium-sized enterprises C health campaign) aims at conducting and evaluating such a stress management training. The focus of evaluation does not only lie on the effects on leaders participating but also on their employees. METHODS: The study is planned as a 2  3 mixed design with two groups (intervention and waiting control group) as a between factor and point in time (at baseline, 6 and 12 months later) as a within factor. We aim at collecting data from N = 200 leaders. Based on the results of a preceding assessment, an already successfully implemented stress management training was adapted to SME needs and now serves as the framework of this intervention. The stress management training comprises one and a half days and is followed by two booster sessions (each 180 min) about 3 and 6 months after the training. The main focus of this intervention lies on specifying leaders stress reactivity while at the same time investigating its effects on employees mental health. Further dependent variables are leaders depression and anxiety scores, effort-reward imbalance, sick days and psychophysiological measures of heart rate variability, hair cortisol, and salivary alpha-amylase. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted from a societal and employers point of view. DISCUSSION: Stress management is a highly relevant issue for leaders in SMEs. By providing an adequate occupational stress management training, we expect to improve leaders and also employees\` mental health, thereby preventing economic losses for SMEs and the national economy. However, collecting data from employees about the success of a stress management training of their leader is a highly sensitive topic. It requires a carefully planned proceeding ensuring for example a high degree of transparency, anonymity, and providing team incentives.

Clustering of risk factors is associated with exponential increases in atherosclerotic burden from a young age. Some medical conditions and risk behaviors occurring in children can either increase the likelihood of higher levels of risk factors (such as chronic kidney disease) or the presence of risk factor clustering (such as obesity and cardiometabolic syndrome), or are associated with acquired coronary artery pathology (such as Kawasaki disease). This creates a milieu for, or increases the impact of, accelerated atherosclerosis that in turn increases the likelihood of premature CVD. This review highlights the importance of considering the total risk factor and risk condition profile of pediatric patients. An algorithm is provided for stratifying patients into high, moderate and at risk categories, and practical examples are provided as to how the evaluation and management of one risk factor or risk condition might need to be intensified in the context of additional risk factors or risk conditions. For example, for treatment of an adolescent with familial hypercholesterolemia, the target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level might be lowered by the concomitant presence of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or elevated lipoprotein(a) levels. As awareness of cardiovascular risk and atherosclerosis in pediatric patients increases, new at risk conditions that warrant consideration are emerging.

It is important that pharmacists have sufficient knowledge and awareness to prevent and control the disease. COVID-19 has been widely covered in the media, which has been a source widely used by healthcare professionals. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and impressions of community pharmacists about COVID-19 and the factors affecting them. Materials and Methods: The questions in this survey were formed using the guideline created by the World Health Organization, a guide composed by the Turkish COVID-19 Scholarly Commission, and data disclosed to the public on the website of the Ministry of Health. The questionnaire was designed with Google forms and then applied to community pharmacists all over Turkey by sharing the survey link. Results: Analyses of 393 questionnaires showed that Ministry of Health/government statements, the internet (scientific sources), and the media were the preferred sources of information (96.7%, 89.6%, and 84%, respectively). \\"Ways to avoid COVID-19\\" was the most searched title (96.9%). It was determined that the names of the two drugs most frequently mentioned by the participants to be used in the treatment of COVID-19 in Turkey were hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (57.5%; 50.1%, respectively). Participants who received information from the media gave less education to patients/customers on personal protection measures against COVID-19 (83.3%) and symptoms of COVID-19 (78.8%); however, their behavior regarding the training of pharmacy personnel was found to be the opposite. It has been determined that about half of the participants (46.6%) mostly trust the Ministry of Health regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Media and other sources influence the knowledge, behavior and impressions of pharmacists'. Having a high level of knowledge positively affects people's behavior.

Smartphones have the potential to provide a real-time, pervasive, unobtrusive and cost-effective way to measure health behaviours and deliver instant feedback to users. Despite this, validity of using smartphones to measure these six key behaviours is largely unknown. The proposed systematic review aims to address this gap by identifying existing smartphone-based approaches to measure these health behaviours and critically appraising, comparing and summarizing the quality of their measurement properties. METHODS A systematic search of the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Library (Wiley), PsychINFO (EBSCOhost), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), Web of Science (Clarivate), SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost) and IEEE Xplore Digital Library databases will be conducted from January 2007 to March 2020. Eligible studies will be those written in English that measure at least one of the six health behaviours of interest via a smartphone and report on at least one measurement property. The primary outcomes will be validity, reliability and/or responsiveness of these measurement approaches. A secondary outcome will be the feasibility (e.g. user burden, usability and cost) of identified approaches. No restrictions will be placed on the participant population or study design. Two reviewers will independently screen studies for eligibility, extract data and assess the risk of bias. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using an appropriate tool. Our results will be described in a narrative synthesis. If feasible, random effects meta-analysis will be conducted where appropriate. DISCUSSION The results from this review will provide important information about the types of smartphone-based approaches currently available to measure the core behavioural risk factors for chronic disease and the quality of their measurement properties. It will allow recommendations on the most suitable and effective measures of these lifestyle behaviours using smartphones. Valid and reliable measurement of these behaviours and risk factor opens the door to targeted and real-time delivery of health behaviour interventions, providing unprecedented opportunities to offset the trajectory toward chronic disease.

In some previous studies it was found that people suffering from mental health issues benefited from social media. However, the use of social media is also significantly associated with increased depression, mood and anxiety disorders in adolescents. Furthermore, it was found that the prevalence of poor mental health was high in medical students. With this background, this study was taken up to contribute to the scarce literature about the impact social media has on the mental well-being of medical students. METHODS: The setting was a medical college and research centre, situated in the metropolitan city of Bengaluru in Karnataka. A pretested and predesigned questionnaire was self-administered anonymously by 318 students. The data was analyzed using appropriate statistics. RESULTS: A statistically significant relationship was found between the amount of time spent on social media and the mental well-being score, according to the Sell and Nagpal scale, of students. In participants with scores of < 90.8, (30.2%) of them used social media for 4 hrs or more, as opposed to those with scores  to 90.8, (35.6%) of them spent between 1 and 2 hrs a day on social media, 90.8 being the mean well-being score in India.

Methods The retrospective results of patients hospitalized to the Tertiary Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 1 March and 30 May 2020, the first peak period of the pandemic in our country, were compared with the data of the same period of the previous year. Results A total of 307 cases were included in our study. The mean gestational weeks of the neonates hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during the COVID-19 period were higher than those in the control group (p: 0.003). During the pandemic period, an increase was found in the frequency of pregnant women presenting to obstetric emergency services in emergencies requiring acute intervention (p: 0.01).

DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cohort study using data from participants aged >12 years presenting with acute respiratory symptoms to a hospital in Western Australia. METHOD: Five cough audio-segments were recorded and four patient-reported symptoms (fever, acute cough, productive cough, and age) were analysed by the smartphone-based algorithm to generate an immediate diagnostic output for CAP. Independent cohorts were recruited to train and test the accuracy of the algorithm. Diagnostic agreement was calculated against the confirmed discharge diagnosis of CAP by specialist physicians. Specialist radiologists reported medical imaging. RESULTS: The smartphone-based algorithm had high percentage agreement (PA) with the clinical diagnosis of CAP in the total cohort (n = 322, positive PA [PPA] = 86.2%, negative PA [NPA] = 86.5%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.95); in participants 22C<65 years (n = 192, PPA = 85.7%, NPA = 87.0%, AUC = 0.94), and in participants aged 65 years (n = 86, PPA = 85.7%, NPA = 87.5%, AUC = 0.94).

In this meta-analysis, the effectiveness of TTM at 32-36 C was compared with no target or a different target for comatose children who achieve a return of sustained circulation after cardiac arrest. METHODS Electronic databases were searched from inception to December 13, 2018. Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies with a comparator group that evaluated TTM in children were included. Pairs of independent reviewers extracted the demographic and outcome data, appraised risk of bias, and assessed GRADE certainty of effects. A random effects meta-analysis was undertaken where possible. RESULTS Twelve studies involving 2060 patients were included. Two randomized controlled trials provided the evidence that TTM at 32-34 C compared with a target at 36-37.5 C did not statistically improve long-term good neurobehavioural survival (risk ratio: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.69-1.93), long-term survival (RR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.93-1.39), or short-term survival (risk ratio: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.96-1.36). TTM at 32-34 C did not show statistically increased risks of infection, recurrent cardiac arrest, serious bleeding, or arrhythmias. A novel analysis suggests that another small RCT might provide enough evidence to show benefit for TTM in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. CONCLUSION There is currently inconclusive evidence to either support or refute the use of TTM at 32-34 C for comatose children who achieve return of sustained circulation after cardiac arrest.

The relationship between 12-month weight loss and subsequent cardiovascular outcomes is explored. METHODS Overweight/obese subjects (N = 10 744), 55 years with cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, received sibutramine plus weight management during a 6-week Lead-in Period before randomization to continue sibutramine (N = 4906) or to receive placebo (N = 4898). The primary endpoint was the time from randomization to first occurrence of a primary outcome event (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death). RESULTS For the total population, mean weight change during Lead-in Period (sibutramine) was -2.54 kg. Post-randomization, mean total weight change to Month 12 was -4.18 kg (sibutramine) or -1.87 kg (placebo). Degree of weight loss during Lead-in Period or through Month 12 was associated with a progressive reduction in risk for the total population in primary outcome events and cardiovascular mortality over the 5-year assessment. Although more events occurred in the randomized sibutramine group, on an average, a modest weight loss of approximately 3 kg achieved in the Lead-in Period appeared to offset this increased event rate. Moderate weight loss (3-10 kg) reduced cardiovascular deaths in those with severe, moderate or mild cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS Modest weight loss over short-term (6 weeks) and longer-term (6-12 months) periods is associated with reduction in subsequent cardiovascular mortality for the following 4-5 years even in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

The a-priori defined essential treatments were oxygen therapy for hypoxia, intravenous fluid for hypotension and an action to protect the airway for reduced consciousness (placing the patient in the lateral position, insertion of an oro-pharyngeal airway or endo-tracheal tube or manual airway protection). Results Of the 1135 hospital in-patients screened, 45 (4.0%) had hypoxia, 103 (9.1%) had hypotension, and 17 (1.5%) had a reduced conscious level. Of those with hypoxia, 40 were not receiving oxygen (88.9%). Of those with hypotension, 94 were not receiving intravenous fluids (91.3%). Of those with a reduced conscious level, nine were not receiving an action to protect the airway (53.0%).

Here, we report the genetic characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequenced from the clinical specimens of 4 human cases and 2 environmental samples. The nucleotide similarity among six SARS-CoV-2 genomes ranged from 99.98% to 99.99%. Compared with the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank No. NC_045512), all six genome sequences shared the same substitutions at nt241(C  T), nt3037(C  T), nt14408(C  T), nt23403(A  G), nt28881(G  A), nt28882(G  A), and nt28883(G  C), which are the characteristic nucleotide substitutions of L-lineage European branch I. This was also proved by the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2. They also have a unique shared nucleotide substitution, nt6026(C  T), which is the characteristic nucleotide substitution of SARS-CoV-2 in Beijing's Xinfadi outbreak. It is noteworthy that there is an amino acid D614G mutation caused by nt23403 substitution in all six genomes, which may enhance the virus's infectivity in humans and help it become the leading strain of the virus to spread around the world today.

Face-to-face interviewing was conducted with 49 rice producers engaged in chemical, organic, and good agricultural practices in farming activities. The results show that most of the emissions were caused during the post-harvest management stage. Following eco-efficiency, organic jasmine rice production offers a reduction in the consumption of resources, reduced impact on the environment, and increased product value. Furthermore, our study shows that crop residue is a key to increase rice yields and decrease GHGs emissions.

STUDY DESIGN: Semi\\\\structured in\\\\depth qualitative interviews (N = 20) were conducted during stay\\\\at\\\\home orders in NYC, the first epicenter of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in the United States. Interviews were conducted over the phone during the earlier stages of the pandemic, between April 2020 and June 2020.

In spite of clinical manifestations similar to the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003, affected organs and severity are yet to be defined. Moreover, viral load alterations and viral shielding among different specimens remained scarce. Therefore, clarifying clinical presentations and correlations among viral loads, disease severity, and viral shielding of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in the disease prevention. METHODS The clinical courses of SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented through Gantt charts. Laboratory examinations and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) among different specimens were tested periodically. Cycle thresholds (CT) were recorded and presented as viral loads. RESULTS From March 2020 to April 2020, four SARS-CoV-2 cases were presented, of which, cases 1 and 2 manifested the symptoms severer than cases 3 and 4, along with higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and graded for lymphocytopenia. Case 4 initially exhibited anosmia, but recovered within a short period. Curves of the CT of all the cases, except case 2, concaved upward after prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin. Except for case 4, the CT in most stool specimens remained undetectable; however, none of the cases presented gastrointestinal symptoms. Surprisingly, the CT values of the saliva specimens were inconsistent with those of the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 manifests various symptoms. Sudden onset of central nervous system symptoms should be considered. The timing of HCQ and azithromycin administration might be a key factor in the viral load reduction. Positive prediction values of RT-qPCR of different specimens should be tested carefully to prevent false-negative results.","output":"The Clinical Manifestations and Interval Changes of Reverse-Transcriptase Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reactions among Different Specimens of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Involving youth with severe communication disabilities in health research is foregrounded in a perspective of rights and participation. Researchers aligned with a participatory and inclusive research agenda recommend that involving youth in health research should be a deliberate and well-planned process. However, limited examples exist of how researchers can facilitate the involvement of youth with severe communication disabilities in research projects. METHOD The aim of this paper was to describe the application of the Involvement Matrix as a conceptual framework to guide the three phases of a research project with youth with severe communication disabilities. RESULTS Six youth aged 19-34 years consented to be involved in the project. All youth had a severe communication disability and used augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to support their involvement in the research project. The Involvement Matrix provided a structure to delineate four involvement roles in three research phases: In Phase 1, youth were listeners to research information and advisors in the needs analysis. In Phase 2, as advisors and decision-makers, youth provided their opinions on selecting picture communication symbols for health materials. In Phase 3, as partners, they were copresenters at an online youth forum. CONCLUSION The Involvement Matrix was used to plan and implement the involvement of youth with severe communication disabilities in codeveloping health materials for use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Involvement Matrix can be applied together with AAC to enable meaningful involvement of youth in a health research project as listeners, advisors, decision-makers and partners.

The statement certainly feels like a warning, but it is a warning that comes with a prescription that carries optimism and hope The warning that the virus will take on the world has indeed been the worlds experience during the first year of COVID-19 But the warning is more ominous with the continual emergence of variants of the coronavirus that have differing characteristics C transmission speed, pathogenicity, evasion of immunity to prior infection or immunization (1) Viruses do not have wants or desires;viruses do not have goals or objectives;and viruses do not have plans for the future However, viruses are in the realm of the living, they do replicate (with the hosts machinery), and they evolve in directions that favor their continued existence As long as their continued existence threatens human health, they are taking on the world Why should the worlds sharing of vaccines be part of the solution? What contribution can COVID-19 vaccines make? How confident should we be in the ability of vaccines to stop these viruses? Virus evolution is dependent on mutations that arise during replication in a host that are transmitted to others, creating subtly and sometime not-so-subtly different lineages that can have selective advantage Stopping replication stops evolution Preventing infection prevents replication Preventing transmission prevents infection To the extent that vaccines are able to decrease the amount of viral replication, viral infection, and viral transmission, the pace of evolution should be able to be slowed, slowing generation of variants, and slowing the virus taking on of the world Can vaccines do that? The current COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for use based on their proven ability to prevent clinical disease, not their ability to prevent transmission and infection However, animal models in preclinical trials showed evidence of prevention of transmission, and evidence is emerging that COVID-19 vaccines prevent infection and transmission Seeing the large decreases of COVID-19 with widespread use of COVID-19 vaccine in Israel is a good sign with real world evidence (2) We are likely to see more and more evidence that COVID-19 vaccines prevent infection and transmission as the world has more experience with the vaccines Based on other routinely-used vaccines, one would expect the COVID-19 vaccines to have some effectiveness against infection and transmission Look at hepatitis A in China The number of infections is hundreds of times lower than in the pre-vaccine era after use of hepatitis A vaccines;fewer infections mean fewer replications Even inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which is often said to not be effective against infection/transmission, has epidemiologically meaningful effectiveness against infection/transmission (3) Several European countries eliminated polioviruses with IPV alone Last year, China stopped a three-year-old outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 with Sabin-strain IPV alone (4) These accomplishments would not have been possible without vaccine effectiveness against infection/transmission Will vaccines cause selection of vaccine-escape mutants? One would expect that viruses less neutralized by vaccines to have selective advantage over viruses more susceptible to vaccine-induced immunity However, this is not a reason to not vaccinate The contribution of selection pressure leading to meaningful vaccine escape is not known Every year, influenza vaccine is changed in attempt to match the upcoming circulating strains, but the reason that circulating strains change is not from vaccine selection pressure, but rather from genetic drift that happens with or without vaccination Virus replication anywhere is a threat everywhere Not only is ongoing transmission a risk to health where it is happening, but also a risk to other places to which the virus can travel This is in part the reason for the World Health Organizations (WHO) call for solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic Along with promoting the development of COVID-19 vaccines, WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, and Gavi created COVAX, a mechanism for sharing vaccines globally Almost all countries of the world have signed onto COVAX, and indeed COVAX has already started sharing COVID-19 vaccines (5) Strengthening COVAX with financing and vaccine supports sharing the vaccine with the world As George Gao says, sharing vaccines with the world is important to prevent the virus from taking on the world Vaccines alone, of course, are not enough Constant vigilance and sensitive surveillance of circulating coronavirus is absolutely essential The first generation of vaccines may need to be updated to keep up with, and ideally get ahead of virus evolution by finding additional vaccine targets Population immunity will need to be frequently assessed against circulating strains and tested for waning immunity Vaccination policies will need to be adjusted as the epidemiology changes Ensuring availability and large-scale use of COVID-19 vaccines by all countries, in solidarity against the COVID-19 pandemic, is a vital strategy to prevent the virus from taking on the world","output":"If the world doesnt share the vaccine, the virus will take on the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All papers published in this volume of IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science have been peer reviewed through processes administered by the proceedings Editors.

Methods: We use data provided by Korea Disease Control & Prevention Agency, National Medical Center, which include the clinical and epidemiological patient data of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who were discharged on, or prior to, April 30, 2020, in South Korea. We conducted comorbidity network and multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with the severity of and mortality from COVID-19 disease. The outcome variable is the categorized clinical severity scores (CSS): mild case (O2 treatment not needed), severe case (O2 treatment needed), and death. Results: A total of 5,771 patients were included. In the fully adjusted model, chronic kidney disease (CKD); odds ratio, 2.59 [95% CI, 1.19 to 5.61] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); odds ratio, 3.19 [95% CI, 1.35 to 7.52] were significantly associated with case severity. The following were associated with an increased risk of death: CKD; odds ratio, 5.35 [95% CI, 2.00 to 14.31], Heart failure (HF) odds ratio, 3.15 [95% CI, 1.22 to 8.15], malignancy odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.59 to 7.17], dementia odds ratio, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.45 to 4.73], and diabetes odds ratio, 2.26 [95% CI, 1.46 to 3.49].

Beyond the lungs, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect a range of other tissues, including the kidney, potentially contributing to acute kidney injury in those with severe disease. We hypothesized that the renal abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2, may be modulated by diabetes and agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). METHODS: The expression of ACE 2 was examined in 49 archival kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease and from 12 healthy, potential living allograft donors using next-generation sequencing technology (RNA Seq). RESULTS: Mean ACE 2 messenger RNA was increased approximately 2-fold in diabetes when compared with healthy control subjects (mean  SD, 13.27.9 vs 7.73.6 reads per million reads, respectively; p=0.001).

Those whose families have undertaken intra- or intergenerational social mobility and who have made a home in a place, Ingleby Barwick in Teesside, that seems to be of them and for theman in-between place that is seen as not quite middle or working class. This paper draws data from a research project that adopted a qualitative phenomenological approach to uncover the meaning of experiences for participants. Methods included focus groups and semi-structured interviews through which 70 local people contributed their thoughts, hopes, concerns, and stories about their lives now and what they aspire to for the future. Places, such as the large private housing estate in the Northeast of England on which this research was carried out, make up significant sections of the UK population, yet tend to be understudied populations, often missed by a sociological gaze attracted to extremes. It was anticipated that in Ingleby Barwick, where social mobility allows access to this relatively exclusive estate, notions of individualism and deservingness that underlie meritocratic ideology (Mendick et al., 2015; Littler, 2018) would be significant, a supposition borne out in the findings. Making it to Ingleby was, and continues to be, indicative to many of meritocratic success, making it a moral place for moral people (McEwan, 2019). Consequently, the threat then posed by economic precarity, of restricting access to the transitions and lifestyles that create the distinction (Bourdieu, 1984) required to denote fit to this place, is noted to be very real in a place ironically marked by many outside it as fundamentally unreal.","output":"Drinking Carling Out of Stella Glasses: People and Place in the Missing Middle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection is associated with various complications. PMA (primary meningococcal arthritis) is a rare meningococcus-associated disease causing arthritis of the knee usually, without any signs of invasive meningococcal disease.

DESIGN: A 42-item electronic questionnaire was sent to all ICRS members, which explored indications, surgical technique, postoperative management, and outcomes of the microfracture procedure for the treatment of symptomatic, full thickness chondral and osteochondral defects of the knee. Responses were compared between surgeons from different regions and years of practice. RESULTS: A total of 385 surgeons answered the questionnaire. There was a significant difference noted in the use of microfracture among surgeons by region (P < 0.001). There was no association between the number of years in practice and the self-reported proportion of microfracture cases performed (P = 0.37). Fifty-eight subjects (15%) indicated that they do not perform microfracture at all. Regarding indication for surgery, 56% of surgeons would limit their indication of microfracture to lesions measuring 2 cm2 or less. Half of the surgeons reported no upper age or body mass index limit. Regarding surgical technique, 90% of surgeons would recommend a formal debridement of the calcified layer and 91% believe it is important to create stable vertical walls. Overall, 47% of surgeons use biologic augmentation, with no significant difference between regions (P = 0.35) or years of practice (P = 0.67). Rehabilitation protocols varied widely among surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Indications, operative technique, and rehabilitation protocols utilized for patients undergoing microfracture procedures vary widely among ICRS members.

An oscillating saw always generates noise, fine infectious dust particles, and the possibility of traumatic injuries, all of which can induce occupational hazard risks to autopsy workers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: The first goal of this study was to explore the production of noise and bone dust emission, comparing an oscillating saw and a robotic autopsy saw during an autopsy. The second goal was to evaluate the performance of a new robotic autopsy method, used during skull opening. The third goal was to encourage mortuary workers to use robotic technology during the autopsy procedure to protect us away from occupational injuries as well as airborne infections. Materials and Methods: The experiments involved a comparison of noise levels and aerosol production during skull cutting between the oscillating saw and the robotic autopsy saw. Results: The results confirmed that noise production from the robotic autopsy saw was lower than the oscillating saw. However, the bone dust levels, produced by the robotic autopsy saw, were greater than the oscillating saw, but were not greater than the dust concentrations which were present before opening the skull. Conclusions: The use of a new robotic system might be an alternative choice for protecting against occupational damage among the healthcare workers.

However, there remains uncertainty regarding rates of false negative results and optimal sampling type. The objective was to determine the reliability of single, pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 testing from the nasopharynx in children undergoing general anesthesia. METHODS: Children < 18 years of age who underwent intubation for a procedure received pre-operative testing 24C48 hours prior with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or wash, in conjunction with intra-operative nasal wash (NW) and tracheal aspirate (TA) sampling. All paired samples underwent testing using the Simplexa DiaSorin platform or a modified Centers for Disease Control assay. Cohens Kappa was used for interrater reliability of each sample result. McNemars Test was used to compare result proportions by sample type. Positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated based on the intraoperative NW as the reference standard. Analyses were conducted using SAS (v 9.4). RESULTS: We collected full sample sets from 364 children from April 14 to May 15; 66% of pre-operative samples were NP swabs. The median age was 6 years (IQR 2,13), 55% were male, 68% were white and 41% of children had a high-risk comorbidity. Most surgeries were conducted by general surgery (23%), followed by orthopedics (19%). Only 2.5% of children had respiratory symptoms, and 4.8% had a documented fever within a week of the procedure. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples occurred in 4/364 (1%) of pre-operative samples, 8/363 (2.2%) of intra-operative samples, and 8/348 (2.3%) of TA samples. The pre-operative test had 100% PPV and 99% NPV, and the TA had 100% PPV and 98.6% NPV (Table 1). There was very good agreement (Figure) between pre- and intraoperative upper respiratory sampling, with a Kappa of 0.66, (95% CI 0.35C0.97). There was no statistical difference in results by sample type. Table 1.

Psychosocial characteristics underlying outcomes require better understanding, particularly on self-managed digital programs. This cross-sectional study examines differences in psychosocial characteristics by weight loss and engagement outcome, and which characteristics are most associated with weight loss, on a self-managed digital weight loss program. Some underexplored psychosocial characteristics are included, such as flourishing, or a sense of meaning and purpose in life. A questionnaire was emailed to a random sample of 10,000 current users at week 5 in the program and 10,000 current users at week 17. The questionnaire was completed by 2225 users, and their self-reported weight and recorded program engagement data were extracted from the programs database. Multiple comparison tests indicated that mental health quality of life, depression, anxiety, work-life balance, and flourishing differed by weight loss outcome at program end (week 17; 5%, 2C5%, below 2%) and by engagement tertile at program beginning and end (weeks 5 and 17). Only anxiety was associated with weight loss in a backward stepwise regression controlling for engagement and sociodemographic characteristics. Flourishing did not predict weight loss overall but predicted the weight loss outcome group.

The objective of this study was to determine if and how the Covid-19 pandemic and its related stressors have impacted women's menstrual cyclicity. Materials and Methods: An online survey instrument designed to capture self-reported information on menstrual cycle changes and perceived stress levels was distributed between July and August 2020. A total of 210 women between the ages of 18-45 years met stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed the survey. Results: Of the 210 respondents, more than half (54%) reported changes in their menstrual cycles. These included changes in menstrual cycle length (50%), the duration of menses (34%), and changes in premenstrual symptoms (50%). Respondents with high perceived stress scale (PSS) scores during Covid were more likely to experience a longer duration of menses (p < 0.001) and heavier bleeding during menses (p = 0.028) compared with those with moderate Covid PSS scores.

Additionally, we explored how methodological differences (direct vs. self-report measures) may affect these estimates. We hypothesized that direct prevalence measures of taste loss would be the most valid because they avoid the taste/smell confusion of self-report. The meta-analysis showed that, among 138,897 COVID-19-positive patients, 39.2% reported taste dysfunction (95% CI: 35.34-43.12%), and the prevalence estimates were slightly but not significantly higher from studies using direct (n = 18) versus self-report (n = 223) methodologies (Q = 0.57, df = 1, p = 0.45).

An important question is whether in addition to these generic risk factors, patients with a potentially altered immune response, either by disease (inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs)) or use of immunomodulatory agents (IA), carry a higher or lower risk of severe COVID-19. In addition, several other potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 have been suggested, such as vitamin D status and specific medication (NSAIDs, ACE-inhibitors)2. Objectives: To identify risk factors for severe COVID-19, requiring hospitalization, in patients with IRDs. Methods: Multicenter, unmatched nested case control study in four rheumatology centers in the Netherlands. Cases are IRD patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 between March 1st 2020 and May 31st 2020. Control patients are IRD patients not hospitalized for COVID-19 within this period and were included in a 1:4 ratio. Patient-, disease-and treatment characteristics were extracted (still ongoing) from electronic patient files, and a questionnaire was used to collect additional data (e.g. on behavioral aspects). Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, corrected for confounders. Results: 77 cases and 198 controls were included. 26 case patients died as a result of COVID-19, 14 were admitted to the ICU. Crude ORs for female sex, age, BMI and presence of one or more comorbidities were 0.46 (95% CI 0.27-0.29), 1.1 (95%CI 1.0-1.1), 1.0 (95%CI 0.98-1.1) and 3.0 (95%CI 1.7-5.2) respectively. Table 1 displays corrected OR, highlighted when OR <0.5/2.0. Corrected ORs were not significantly increased for any IRD, but a trend for gout was present. Use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) shows a protective effect, while use of other csDMARDs than methotrexate or HCQ leads to a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Trends were present for increased risk for rituximab (RTX), glucocorticoids and ACE inhibitors, and protective effect for IL-6R blockers. Conclusion: The outcomes of this study are in agreement with other research regarding risk of severe COVID-19 related to IRDs and use of IA1. The suggested increased risk of severe COVID-19 in RTX use is of concern and should be monitored closely. Strengths of this study include low bias due to behavioral effects as only cases early in the pandemic were included, completeness of the determinants of interest and ultimately, it provides answers to a relevant and urgent question.","output":"In depth identification of risk factors for severe COVID-19, requiring hospitalization, in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases: Results of a dutch nested case control study (preliminary results)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Four of eleven affected dogs died despite aggressive treatment during a 2015 focal outbreak of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis following a stay in a pet housing facility.

CaVV nucleic acid corresponded to areas of necrosis and hemorrhage primarily in the intestinal tract, but also in the brain of one dog with nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis. This is the first report of an atypical disease association with a putative hypervirulent vesivirus strain in dogs, as all other known strains of CaVV appear to cause nonclinical infections or relatively mild disease. After identification of the CU-296 vesivirus strain from this outbreak, four additional CaVV strains were amplified from unrelated fecal specimens and archived stocks provided by other laboratories. Broader questions include the origins, reservoir(s), and potential for reemergence and spread of these related CaVVs.","output":"Characterization of a Vesivirus Associated with an Outbreak of Acute Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis in Domestic Dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness disposition is associated with various psychological factors and prevents emotional distress in chronic diseases In the present study, we analyzed the key role of mindfulness dispositions in protecting the individual against psychological distress consequent to COVID-19 social distancing and quarantining METHODS: An online survey was launched on March 13, 2020, with 6,412 responses by April 6, 2020 Socio-demographic information, exposure to the pandemic, and quarantining were assessed together with psychological distress and mindfulness disposition Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to study the influence of predictive factors on psychological distress and quality of life in Italian responders during the early days of lockdown Pearson correlations were calculated to study the relationship between mindfulness and psychiatric symptoms RESULTS: Multivariate linear regression run on socio-demographics, COVID-19-related variables, and mindfulness disposition as moderators of overall psychological distress showed that mindfulness was the best predictor of psychological distress ( = -0 504;p &lt; 0 0001) High negative correlations were found between mindfulness disposition and the overall Global Severity Index (r = -0 637;p &lt; 0 0001), while moderate to high associations were found between mindfulness and all SCL-90 sub-scales DISCUSSION: Findings showed that high dispositional mindfulness enhances well-being and helps in dealing with stressful situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic Mindfulness-based mental training could represent an effective intervention to stem post-traumatic psychopathological beginnings and prevent the onset of chronic mental disorders","output":"Mindfulness, Age and Gender as Protective Factors Against Psychological Distress During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"14 strategies to safeguard nurses' mental health.","output":"Caring for COVID's emotional long haulers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Estimating infectious disease parameters such as the serial interval (time between symptom onset in primary and secondary cases) and reproductive number (average number of secondary cases produced by a primary case) are important in understanding infectious disease dynamics. Many estimation methods require linking cases by direct transmission, a difficult task for most diseases. METHODS: Using a subset of cases with detailed genetic and/or contact investigation data to develop a training set of probable transmission events, we build a model to estimate the relative transmission probability for all case-pairs from demographic, spatial and clinical data. Our method is based on naive Bayes, a machine learning classification algorithm which uses the observed frequencies in the training dataset to estimate the probability that a pair is linked given a set of covariates. RESULTS: In simulations, we find that the probabilities estimated using genetic distance between cases to define training transmission events are able to distinguish between truly linked and unlinked pairs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve value of 95%). Additionally, only a subset of the cases, 10-50% depending on sample size, need to have detailed genetic data for our method to perform well. We show how these probabilities can be used to estimate the average effective reproductive number and apply our method to a tuberculosis outbreak in Hamburg, Germany.

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review was performed of all surgical consults at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in the 30 days prior to and 30 days following confirmation of the first COVID-19 patient at the institution. Consults to all divisions within general surgery were included. RESULTS Total surgical consult volume decreased by 43% in the post-COVID-19 period, with a significant reduction in the median daily consult volume from 14 to 8 (P < .0001). Changes in consult volume by patient location, chief complaint, and surgical division were variable, in aggregate reflecting a disproportionate decrease among less acute surgical complaints. The percentage of consults resulting in surgical intervention remained equal in the 2 periods (31% vs 28%, odds ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.61-1.21, P = .38) with most but not all operation types decreasing in frequency. The rise in the COVID-19 inpatient census led to increased consultation for vascular access, accommodated at our center by the creation of a new surgical procedures team.

Teachers were required to put remote teaching and learning in place with only two days' notice from the government. AIMS: The current study explores teachers' experiences of this abrupt change to their working practices, and during the 5-6 weeks that followed. SAMPLE: Twenty-four teachers from English state schools were interviewed, representing mainstream primary and secondary schools and a range of years of experience and seniority. METHODS: Participants were asked to tell stories of three key scenes during the first 5-6 weeks of lockdown: a low point, a high point, and a turning point. A reflexive thematic analysis of their narratives was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Six themes were identified: uncertainty, finding a way, worry for the vulnerable, importance of relationships, teacher identity, and reflections. Teachers' narratives suggest that, after an initial period of uncertainty they settled into the situation and found a way forward, supported by strong relationships. However, they remain extremely worried about the most vulnerable pupils and want more joined-up thinking from the government on how to support them effectively, along with clarity from policymakers to enable planning ahead. Teachers reflected on how to use their learning during this period to improve pupils' experiences of education post-COVID-19, and on how aspects of shared teacher identity have worked as stressors and coping mechanisms. These initial interviews form the baseline for a longitudinal interview study of teachers' experiences of COVID-19 in England.","output":"'Like a rug had been pulled from under you': The impact of COVID-19 on teachers in England during the first six weeks of the UK lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 coronavirus is now spreading worldwide.

However, patients with coarse information of the exposure date, as well as infections other than the symptomatic, were not taken into account in previously published studies. Thus, by using the statistical method dealing with the interval-censored data, we assessed the quarantine duration for both common and uncommon infections. The latter type includes the presymptomatic, the asymptomatic and the recurrent test positive patients. METHODS: As of 10 December 2020, information on cases have been collected from the English and Chinese databases, including Pubmed, Google scholar, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang. Official websites and medias were also searched as data sources. All data were transformed into doubly interval-censored and the accelerated failure time model was applied. By estimating the incubation period and the time-to-event distribution of worldwide COVID-19 patients, we obtain the large percentiles for determining and suggesting the quarantine policies. For symptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 patients, the incubation time is the duration from exposure to symptom onset. For the asymptomatic, we substitute the date of first positive result of nucleic acid testing for that of symptom onset. Furthermore, the time from hospital discharge or getting negative test result to the positive recurrence has been calculated for recurrent positive patients. RESULTS: A total of 1920 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were included. Among all uncommon infections, 34.1% (n = 55) of them developed symptoms or were identified beyond fourteen days. Based on all collected cases, the 95th and 99th percentiles were estimated to be 16.2 days (95% CI 15.5-17.0) and 22.9 days (21.7a??24.3) respectively. Besides, we got similar estimates based on merely symptomatic and presymptomatic infections as 15.1 days (14.4a??15.7) and 21.1 days (20.0a??22.2). CONCLUSIONS: There are a certain number of infected people who require longer quarantine duration. Our findings well support the current practice of the extended active monitoring. To further prevent possible transmissions induced and facilitated by such infectious outliers after the 14-days quarantine, properly prolonging the quarantine duration could be prudent for high-risk scenarios and in regions with insufficient test resources.","output":"Demand for longer quarantine period among common and uncommon COVID-19 infections: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Postmortem analysis in COVID-19 infected patients has shown diffuse alveolar damage with inflammatory infiltrate present. It has been suggested that COVID-19 can induce a cytokine release syndrome caused by a systemic inflammatory response. This pulmonary hyperinflammation would be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, which has been described as the main cause of COVID-19 mortality. Radiation therapy administered at low doses (LD-RT) has antiinflammatory properties such as lowering levels of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting endothelial-leukocyte interaction, and changing the polarization of macrophages. In addition, LD-RT was used for pneumonia in the first half of the 20th century with evidence suggesting potential efficacy. In this context, several institutions proposed trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy LDRT to treat COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted a prospective phase I-II trial enrolling COVID-19 patients  50 years-old, with bilateral lung involvement at imaging study and oxygen requirement. Patients received 1 Gy to total lungs in a single fraction. Forty-one patients were included. Three patients died <72h after LD-RT and were excluded from the analysis. Primary outcome was radiological response assessed by severity and extension scores at days 0, +3 and +7. Lung extension score on CT improved significantly (p=0.02) on day +7, however severity score was stable or slightly decreased (p=0.1). Clinically, patients improved SatO2/ FiO2 index significantly on day +3 and +7 (p<0.01). Our results are in agreement with previous data published by Ameri et al. They analyzed 9 patients treated with 0.5 or 1 Gy and found a SatO2 improvement in 63.6% of the patients 24 hours after RT, no significant differences were found between both fractionations. Hess et al compared 10 patients treated with 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT with 10 control patients blindly matched by age and comorbidity, and they concluded that patients treated with LD-RT showed a significant faster recovery to room air than controls (3 days vs 12 days respectively, p=0.05). Also, LD-RT cohort trended toward superior rates of improved radiographs (P=0.12), delirium (P <.01), rate of intubation (10% vs 40%) and median time to hospital discharge (12 days vs 20 days). At our cohort with a median follow up of 95 days, 25 (66%) patients were discharged with a similar time to that reported by Hess et al, and 13 (34%) died. Less promising results were found when LD-RT was explored in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Papachristofilou et al, randomized 22 patients to either 1 Gy whole-lung RT or sham-RT. They hypothesized that LD-RT would increase ventilator-free days (VFDs) to 10 days. The study failed to improve VFDs compared to sham-RT. LD-RT neither improved PaO2/FiO2 or overall survival at 28 days at this severe ill cohort. Moreover, although the baseline characteristics were overall similar in both groups, there was a higher proportion of patients managed with endotracheal intubation and higher rate of comorbidities in the LD-RT group. At our cohort only 5 patients (13%) were at ICU, 3 died and 2 were discharged. Regarding toxicity, no grade 3 was found in the reported studies. However, in our cohort 9 patients (23.7%) experimented grade 3-4 lymphopenia, although 8 of them had lymphopenia before treatment. Preliminary results show that LD-RT is feasible and well-tolerated treatment, with potential clinical improvement. Prospective randomized trials are needed to define the real efficacy of LD-RT.","output":"SP-0141 Low-dose radiotherapy for treatment of Covid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Safety analyses in the French Observatory have shown that treatment of intracranial aneurysms by using flow disruption with the Woven EndoBridge Device (WEB) is safe, with low morbidity and no mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with bifurcation aneurysms were included in this prospective, multicenter good clinical practices study. A medical monitor independently analyzed procedural and clinical data. The study started with the WEB DL, and secondarily, the WEB SL/SLS was authorized in the study. RESULTS Between November 2012 and January 2014, 10 French centers included 62 patients with 63 aneurysms. Thirty patients with 31 aneurysms were treated with the WEB DL, and 32 patients with 32 aneurysms, with the WEB SL/SLS. The percentage of anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated with WEB SL/SLS was significantly higher (37.5%) compared with WEB DL (12.9%) (P = .04). The WEB SL/SLS was more frequently used in aneurysms of <10 mm than the WEB DL (respectively, 96.9% and 67.7%; P = .002).

Post-authorization safety data have also identified myocarditis as a rare safety event following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, most notably among younger adult males and after dose 2. To further evaluate the potential risk after vaccination, we queried the Moderna global safety database to assess the occurrence of myocarditis/myopericarditis among mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients worldwide since first international Emergency Use Authorization issuance. MethodsReports of myocarditis/myopericarditis entered into the Moderna global safety database from December 18, 2020 to September 30, 2021 were reviewed and classified based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition. The cumulative observed occurrence of myocarditis/myopericarditis was assessed by calculating the reported rate after any known dose of mRNA-1273 according to age and sex. This reporting rate was compared to a population-based incidence rate (US military) to calculate observed-to-expected rate ratios (RR). ResultsThrough September 30, 2021, a total of 1,439 cases of myocarditis/myopericarditis among approximately 151.1 million mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients were reported to the Moderna global safety database. The overall reporting rate among all vaccine recipients was 0.95 cases per 100,000 vaccine recipients, which was lower than the expected rate from the reference population (2.12 cases per 100,000 vaccine recipients; RR [95% CI]: 0.45 [0.42-0.48]). When stratified by sex and age, observed rates were highest for males aged []39 years, particularly those aged 18-24 years (7.40 cases per 100,000 vaccine recipients), which was higher than expected (RR [95% CI]: 3.49 [2.88-4.22]). For males and females aged <18 years, the rate ratio for myocarditis was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.52-2.13) and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.04-0.94), respectively. When considering only cases occurring within 7 days after vaccination, the observed rate was highest for males aged 18-24 years after dose 2 (4.9 cases per 100,000 doses administered).

METHOD Experimental wounds produced in an in vitro porcine wound model were homogenously contaminated with bacterial suspension and treated with NPWT and different options. Group A: non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing; group B: antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing containing silver; group C: antimicrobial gauze dressing containing polyhexanide; group D: non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing intermittently irrigated with octenidine; group E: negative control (non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing without NPWT). Standard biopsies were harvested after 24 and 28 hours. RESULTS This study demonstrated that the use of NPWT with intermitted instillation of octenidine (group D) or application of silver-based polyurethane foam dressings (group B) is significantly superior against Staphylococcus aureus colonisation in experimental wounds compared with non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressing (group A) after 48 hours. Surprisingly, the polyhexanide-based dressing (group C) used in this model showed no statistical significant effect compared with the control group (group E) after 24 or 48 hours of treatment. CONCLUSION Both intermitted instillation of octenidine and silver-based dressings in standard NPWT were significantly superior compared with non-antimicrobial polyurethane foam dressings or PHMB coated gauze dressing after 48 hours.","output":"The effect of negative pressure wound therapy with antibacterial dressings or antiseptics on an in vitro wound model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The converging crises of COVID-19 and racist state violence in 2020 shifted public discourse about marginalization, public health, and racism in unprecedented ways. Nursing responded to the pandemic with heroic commitment and new politicization. But public engagement with systemic racism is forcing a reckoning in nursing. The profession has its own history of racism and of alliance with systems of state control with which to contend. In this article, we argue nursing must adopt an ethics of abolitionism to realize its goals for health and justice. Abolitionism theorizes that policing and prison systems, originating from systems of enslavement and colonial rule, continue to function as originally intended, causing racial oppression and violence. The harms of these systems will not be resolved through their reform but through creation of entirely new approaches to community support.

Herein, we explore the N protein of SARS-CoV2 to identify promising epitope-based vaccine candidates and target the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 N-protein for potential inhibitors using an integrative bioinformatics approach. We identified B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes that are non-toxic, non-allergenic, capable of inducing IFN-?3 and structurally stable with high global population coverage of response.

METHODS We enrolled 49 patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect who were operated by a single surgeon between 2004 and 2014. The modified single-patch technique was performed in 32 cases (group S), whereas the defect was repaired with the double-patch technique in 17 patients (group D). RESULTS The mean age at the time of operation was 7.7  8.6 (range 1-48) months and 9.9  12.5 (range 1.5-48) months, in groups S and D, respectively. Mean body weight was 6.7  3 (range 3.5-15.5) kilograms and 7.2  3.8 (range 4.3-14.5) kilograms in groups S and D, respectively. Cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times were shorter in the modified single-patch group (65.6  16.3 vs. 98.7  19.8 minutes, p = 0.0001; 88.9  23.3 vs. 128.9  28.0 minutes, p = 0.0001).

To better forecast and control the risk of such multi-epidemics, it is essential to elucidate the potential interactions of SARS-CoV- 2 with other pathogens; these interactions, however, remain poorly defined. Here, we aimed to review the current body of evidence about SARS-CoV-2 interactions. To study pathogen interactions in a systematic way, we first developed a general framework to capture their major components - namely, sign, strength, symmetry, duration, and mechanism. We then reviewed the experimental evidence from animal models about SARS-CoV-2 interactions. The studies identified demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus co-infection increased disease severity compared with mono-infection. By contrast, the effect of previous or co-infection on viral load of either virus was inconsistent across studies. Next, we reviewed the epidemiological evidence about SARS-CoV-2 interactions in human populations. Although numerous studies were identified, only few were specifically designed to infer interaction and many were prone to bias and confounding. Nevertheless, their results suggested that influenza and pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations were associated with reduced risk, and earlier influenza infection with increased risk, of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. Finally, we formulated simple transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 co-circulation with a virus or a bacterium, showing how they can naturally incorporate the proposed framework.

Moreover, recent analysis showed that miR-146 is predicted to target at the SARS-CoV-2 genome. As the dominant regulator of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) downstream signaling, miR-146a may limit excessive inflammatory response to virus. Downregulation of circulating miR-146a was found in diabetes, obesity and hypertension and it is reflected by enhanced inflammation and fibrosis, systemic effects accompanying severe COVID-19.

The thermal, optical, vibrational, and structural properties were investigated, particularly for 50R2O3-50B2O3 glasses. The glass transition temperature increased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+, while the thermal stability was not affected by the glass composition. The packing density increased with a decrease in the ionic radius of R3+ due to lanthanoid contraction. Raman scattering and Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that, in the rare-earth-rich glasses, no conventional three-dimensional networks consisting of corner-sharing BOn (n = 3 or 4) units existed because all B atoms were formed as isolated BO3 units. The simple environment around B atoms in the glasses led to additional IR transmittance regions, irrespective of the kinds of R.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective controlled study of 232 SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2Cnaive SLE patients and 58 SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2Cnaive controls who were vaccinated with 2 doses of Sinovac\\\\CoronaVac with a 28\\\\day interval (day 0/day 28 [D0/D28]).

The influence of individual drugs on immune response and safety was assessed. RESULTS: Patients and controls were well balanced for age (P = 0.771). At D69, SLE patients showed a moderate SC (70.2% versus 98.1%; P < 0.001) and moderate frequency of NAb positivity (61.5% versus 84.6%; P = 0.002), although both frequencies were lower than in controls. Factors associated with lower SC in univariate analysis at D69 were prednisone use (odds ratio [OR] 0.215 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.108C0.427], P < 0.001) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) use (OR 0.201 [95% CI 0.107C0.378], P < 0.001), whereas hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use led to a 2.5 increase in SC (P = 0.011).

However, little is known about how word finding depends on white-matter tract integrity, in particular, the atrophy of tracts located ventrally to the Sylvian fissure. To elucidate this question, we examined word finding in individuals with PPA and healthy controls employing PWI, tractography, and computer simulations using the WEAVER++ model of word finding. Twenty-three individuals with PPA and twenty healthy controls named pictures in two noise conditions. Mixed-effects modelling was performed on naming accuracy and reaction time (RT) and fixel-based tractography analyses were conducted to assess the relation between ventral white-matter integrity and naming performance. Naming RTs were longer for individuals with PPA compared to controls and, critically, individuals with PPA showed a larger noise effect compared to controls. Moreover, this difference in noise effect was differentially related to tract integrity. Whereas the noise effect did not depend much on tract integrity in controls, a lower tract integrity was related to a smaller noise effect in individuals with PPA. Computer simulations supported an explanation of this paradoxical finding in terms of reduced propagation of noise when tract integrity is low.

Our surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and molecular docking analyses revealed the possible mechanisms via which these compounds interfere with the interaction between RBD and ACE2. Hence, our results indicate that CEBIT is highly versatile for identifying drugs against SARS-CoV-2 entry, and targeting CoV-2 entry by small molecule drugs is a viable therapeutic option to treat COVID-19 in addition to commonly used monoclonal antibodies.","output":"CEBIT Screening for Inhibitors of the Interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Establishing business relationships with entities that can naturally and consistently refer others to your content, such as libraries and e-book distributors, can further your reach and boost resiliency in times of crisis Many Utah professors were not aware of library-licensing options for e-books, but adoption of eBooks because of impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue in the future Partnerships between academic librarians, campus bookstores, tutors, and even the Registrar are crucial to delivering agile responses to teaching needs A worryingly low number of teaching resources are available in digital form C and these are likely to be side-lined where digital access becomes a requirement There are higher expectations around access and navigation of e-books than printed versions, with frustration when they cannot be easily used Students appreciate lower costs and ease of access but are neither aware nor concerned about the different licensing agreements underpinning their access to materials ? 2021 The Authors Learned Publishing ? 2021 ALPSP","output":"Opportunities for eTextbook innovations and partnerships: A case study of the Marriott Library at the University of Utah"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiac dysfunction, mainly assessed by biomarker alterations, has been described in COVID-19 infection. However, there are still areas of uncertainty regarding its effective role in disease evolution. Aim of this study was to evaluate early echocardiographic parameters in COVID pneumonia and their association with severity disease and prognosis. METHODS: An echocardiographic examination was performed within 72 h from admission in 64 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in our medium-intensity care unit, from March 30th to May 15th 2020. Six patients were excluded for inadequate acoustic window. RESULTS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients were finally enrolled, with a median age of 58 years. Twenty-two (38%) were classifiable as severe COVID-19 disease. Eight out of 58 patients experienced adverse evolution (six died, two were admitted to ICU and received mechanical ventilation), all of them in the severe pneumonia group. Severe pneumonia patients showed higher troponin, IL-6 and D-Dimer values. No significant new onset alterations of left and right ventricular systolic function parameters were observed. Patients with severe pneumonia showed higher mean estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) (30.7  5.2 mmHg vs 26.2  4.3 mmHg, p = 0.006), even if in the normality range values. No differences in echocardiographic parameters were retrieved in patients with adverse events with respect to those with favorable clinical course. CONCLUSION: A mild sPAP increase in severe pneumonia patients with respect to those with milder disease was the only significant finding at early echocardiographic examination, without other signs of new onset major cardiac dysfunction. Future studies are needed to deepen the knowledge regarding minor cardiac functional perturbation in the evolution of a complex systemic disorder, in which the respiratory involvement appears as the main character, at least in non-ICU patients.","output":"Early echocardiographic findings in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia: a prospective, single center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What nurses need to know as hospitals institute COVID-19 vaccine mandates.","output":"Employer Vaccine Mandates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although about 80% of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases are reported to be mild, the remaining 20% of cases often result in severe disease with the potential of crushing already overstrained health care services. There has been sustainable growth of COVID-19 cases worldwide since mid-May 2020. To keep tabs on community transmission of COVID-19 infection screening of the samples from a large population is needed which includes asymptomatic/symptomatic individuals along with the migrant population. This requires extra resources, man power, and time for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the current scenario, the pooled sample testing strategy advocated by the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi is a new approach that is very promising in resource-limited settings. In this study, we have evaluated the pooled strategy in terms of accurate testing results, utilization of consumables, and identification of borderline positive cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April and June 2020, we performed COVID-19 testing by RT-PCR from areas with varying prevalence of population referred to COVID laboratory, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow. In the first step, the samples are collated into pools of 5 or 10. These pools are tested by RT-PCR. Negative pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 are then deconvoluted and each sample is tested individually. RESULTS: In the present study, we tested 4620 samples in 462 pools of 10 and 14 940 samples in 2990 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool, 61 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 61 pools (610 samples) deconvoluted strategy was followed in which 72 individual samples came positive. The pooled-sample testing strategy helps saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76% to 93% fewer tests done in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled-sample PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison with individual testing without compromising the resulting outcome of the test. In particular, the pooled-sample approach can facilitate mass screening in the early coming stages of COVID-19 outbreaks, especially in low- and middle-income settings, and control the spread by meticulous testing of all risk groups.","output":"Evaluation of sample pooling for diagnosis of COVID-19 by real time-PCR: A resource-saving combat strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The gut barrier serves as the primary interface between the environment and host in terms of surface area and complexity. Luminal chemosensing is a term used to describe how small molecules in the gut lumen interact with the host through surface receptors or via transport into the subepithelial space. In this review, we have summarized recent advances in the understanding of the luminal chemosensory system in the gastroduodenal epithelium consisting of enterocytes, enteroendocrine, and tuft cells, with particular emphasis on how chemosensing affects mucosal protective responses and the metabolic syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS Recent single-cell RNA sequencing provides detailed cell type-specific expression of chemosensory receptors and other bioactive molecules as well as cell lineages; some are similar to lingual taste cells whereas some are gut specific. Gut luminal chemosensing is not only important for the local or remote regulation of gut function, but also contributes to the systemic regulation of metabolism, energy balance, and food intake. We will discuss the chemosensory mechanisms of the proximal intestine, in particular to gastric acid, with a focus on the cell types and receptors involved in chemosensing, with emphasis on the rare chemosensory cells termed tuft cells. We will also discuss the chemosensory functions of intestinal ectoenzymes and bacterial components (e.g., lipopolysaccharide) as well as how they affect mucosal function through altering the gut-hormonal-neural axis.

METHODS Twenty-three IRE ablation zones were created in 4 Yorkshire pig livers percutaneously under image guidance. A prototype generator was used (Ethicon Endo-surgery, Cincinnati, Ohio). Variable spacing of paired electrodes between 1 and 2.0 cm was used. Contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT scans were obtained. Pigs were killed after 5 to 6 hours for gross pathology sectioning with routine and vital histological stains. Computed tomography images were analyzed using 3-dimensional software, and ablation zone size measured on CT was correlated with pathologically determined size. RESULTS Nineteen of 19 ablation zones created with up to 1.5-cm spacing showed fusion between individual ablation zones generated by each electrode. Ablation zones were isodense precontrast and hypodense to liver postcontrast, with best delineation in the portal phase. Nine of these had nondistorted circumferential margins on both CT and gross pathology suitable for correlation, and among these, size measurements on CT were closely correlated with pathologically determined ablation zone size. Most importantly, on the delayed venous phase, there is internal enhancement within the ablation zone itself, except for small perielectrode zones that remained hypodense. On histopathology, IRE ablation zones showed preserved microvasculature with congestion of sinusoids, except for small perielectrode zones where coagulative changes were suggested.

The highest levels of mRNA and protein expression of paramyosin have been found in foot and the smooth adductor muscle. According to whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH), strong paramyosin mRNA signals were detected in the symmetric positions of anterior and posterior adductor muscles at late larval stages. These findings support that paramyosin may serve as the most important components for myogenesis and catch regulation in scallops.

This mini-exon sequence is derived from the 5 end of a 137 nucleotide RNA (medRNA). The remainder of each mRNA is derived from a protein-coding exon that is not linked to the mini-exon. We propose that medRNA is spliced in trans to de-novo-initiated transcripts of protein-coding genes. This trans splicing model predicts that the downstream portion of medRNA will be part of a branched structure and then be released as a free product (minRNA). We demonstrate that significant levels of minRNA exist in trypanosome RNA. Furthermore, minRNA can be released from high molecular weight RNA by a HeLa cell S100 debranching extract.

Biscuit samples showed a COPs content that is strictly related to the egg products used. Samples formulated with spray-dried eggs noticed lower amounts of COPs compared to those formulated with pasteurized eggs.

Mutations in GPCRs that result in loss of function or alterations in signaling can lead to inherited or acquired diseases. Herein, studying prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2), we initially identify distinct interactomes for wild-type (WT) versus a mutant (P290S) PROKR2 that causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. We then find that both the WT and mutant PROKR2 are targeted for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation, but the mutant is degraded to a greater extent. Further analysis revealed that both forms can also leave the ER to reach the Golgi. However, whereas most of the WT is further transported to the cell surface, most of the mutant is retrieved to the ER. Thus, the post-ER itinerary plays an important role in distinguishing the ultimate fate of the WT versus the mutant. We have further discovered that this post-ER itinerary reduces ER stress induced by the mutant PROKR2. Moreover, we extend the core findings to another model GPCR. Our findings advance the understanding of disease pathogenesis induced by a mutation at a key residue that is conserved across many GPCRs and thus contributes to a fundamental understanding of the diverse mechanisms used by cellular quality control to accommodate misfolded proteins.","output":"Trafficking-defective mutant PROKR2 cycles between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi to attenuate endoplasmic reticulum stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have reported varying estimates of epidemiological parameters including serial interval distributions, i.e., the time between illness onset in successive cases in a transmission chain, and reproduction numbers.

We analyzed a detailed subset of data on 3343 confirmed and 667 probable Ebola cases collected in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of September 14. RESULTS The majority of patients are 15 to 44 years of age (49.9% male), and we estimate that the case fatality rate is 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 73) among persons with known clinical outcome of infection.

This phenomenon is classically attributed to platelet consumption due to inflammation-induced coagulation, sequestration from the circulation by phagocytosis and hypersplenism, and impaired platelet production due to defective megakaryopoiesis or cytokine-induced myelosuppression. All these mechanisms, while plausible and supported by substantial evidence, regard platelets as passive bystanders during viral infection.

In many countries, including Libya, institutions and organizations began to implement telehealth technology for the first time. This was to create an alternative modality for direct doctor-patient interviews to reduce the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the usability of telehealth services in Libya and to provide an overview of the current COVID-19 situation. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2020 and May 2020 among the Libyan population using an anonymous online survey. Participants were contacted by sending mobile messages, emails, and via social media. The survey included items that covered sociodemographic characteristics, the availability and accessibility of healthcare services, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care services, mental health assessment, and the feasibility and application of the telehealth system. RESULTS: We obtained 2512 valid responses; the majority (1721, 68.5%) were from females. The mean age ( standard deviation) was 28.2  7.6 years; 92.9% were < 40 years-of-age and 58.2% were single. With regards to the assessment of healthcare services and accessibility, 31.1% reported that their health status was poor in general, and 19.6% reported having at least one chronic disease confirmed. In addition, 19.9% reported varying degrees of difficulty when accessing healthcare centers, and 62% were unable to access their medical records. Strikingly, 61.6% reported having problems covering medical costs, and 56.9% avoided seeking medical care due to financial concerns. With regards to the feasibility of the telehealth system, approximately 50% agreed on the usefulness of telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 61.5% stated that the system was an effective means of communication and attaining healthcare services. The survey also showed that 57.1% felt comfortable while using the telehealth system and that 44.9% felt that they were able to express themselves effectively. Also, 55.3% found the system easy to understand, and 53.9% reported excellent communication with doctors using the telehealth system. However, only 40.5% reported that communication was better than the usual methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that the Libyan population reported high levels of usability and willingness to use the telemedicine system as an alternative modality to in-person appointments. These systems is advantageous as it overcomes financial costs, increases access to timed medical care and follow-ups, and, most importantly, reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, internet connectivity and electricity issues could be a substantial barrier in many resource-limited communities, and further studies should address such obstacles in the future.","output":"The utilization of telehealth services in Libya as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNSTRUCTURED N/A.","output":"Authors Reply to: Screening Tools: Their Intended Audiences and Purposes.

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.18 and 0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4 and 3.9 days). We found that for such rapid epidemic growth, high levels of intervention efforts are necessary, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6 and 8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depend on R0, the duration of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.","output":"Estimating the reproductive number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and eight European countries and implications for vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 around the world has caused many undesirable effects on human health.

The theory has been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic with two competing factors: Health and Economy. As main result, to minimize the total number of deaths, the recommendation is to balance the emphasis on both factors. This implies to give more emphasis to the economic factor, by avoiding restrict interventions like lockdowns and business closures. The model may evolve from a qualitative to a quantitative status, allowing for computational simulations aimed at validations and forecasting.

During mandatory ventilation, flow-controlled expiration (FLEX), which mimics the expiratory flow course of PLB utilizing a digital system for measurement and control, was shown to exert lung protective effects. However, PLB requires a patients participation and coordinated muscular effort and FLEX requires a complex technical setup. Here, we present an adjustable flow regulator to mimic PLB and FLEX, respectively, without the need of a patients participation, or a complex technical device. METHODS: Our study consisted of two parts: First, in a lung model which was ventilated with standard settings (tidal volume 500 ml, respiratory rate 12 min(?1), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cmH(2)O), the possible reduction of the maximal expiratory flow by utilizing the flow regulator was assessed. Second, with spontaneously breathing healthy volunteers, the short-term effects of medium and strong expiratory flow reduction on airway pressure, the change of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), and breathing discomfort was investigated. RESULTS: In the lung model experiments, expiratory flow could be reduced from ? 899  9 mls(?1) down to ? 328  25 mls(?1). Thereby, inspiratory variables and PEEP were unaffected. In the volunteers, the maximal expiratory flow of ? 574  131 mls(?1) under baseline conditions was reduced to ? 395  71 mls(?1) for medium flow regulation and to ? 266  58 mls(?1) for strong flow regulation, respectively (p < 0.001). Accordingly, mean airway pressure increased from 0.6  0.1 cmH(2)O to 2.9  0.4 cmH(2)O with medium flow regulation and to 5.4  2.4 cmH(2)O with strong flow regulation, respectively (p < 0.001). The EELV increased from baseline by 31  458 ml for medium flow regulation and 320  681 ml for strong flow regulation (p = 0.033). The participants rated breathing with the flow regulator as moderately uncomfortable, but none rated breathing with the flow regulator as intolerable. CONCLUSIONS: The flow regulator represents an adjustable device for application of a self-regulated expiratory resistive load, representing an alternative for PLB and FLEX. Future applications in spontaneously breathing patients and patients with mandatory ventilation alike may reveal potential benefits.

We analyzed 5 years of results for a multiplex NAAT targeting 14 respiratory viruses to determine how often repeat testing is ordered and the time interval when results are likely to change.Methods: Results for NAAT performed on nasopharyngeal specimens repeated within 90 days of initial testing were analyzed. Logistic regression models were used to compare time intervals between tests on the odds of a change in sample result.Results: During the study period, 21,819 nasopharyngeal specimens were submitted from 16,779 individuals. Of these, 8,807 (40%) samples were positive for at least one viral pathogen. Among this cohort, 2,583 (12%) specimens collected from 1,473 (9%) patients were repeat tests within 90 days of an initial test. If repeated within 90 days, 71% (1833) of tests did not have a change in result. Initially negative tests typically remained negative whereas initial positive tests mostly remained positive until 11- 15 days. Odds of result change plateaued after 20 days. The odds of a change in result for tests repeated within 20 days were only 0.52 times the odds for 21-90 days (95% CI 0.43, 0.62, p<0.001).Conclusions: Multiplex testing for respiratory viruses that are repeated within short periods lead to redundant results at additional costs.

MEASUREMENTS: Patient trajectories and outcomes, categorized by using the World Health Organization COVID-19 disease severity scale. Primary outcomes were death and a composite of severe disease or death. RESULTS: Median patient age was 64 years (range, 1 to 108 years); 47% were women, 40% were Black, 16% were Latinx, and 21% were nursing home residents. Among all patients, 131 (16%) died and 694 (83%) were discharged (523 [63%] had mild to moderate disease and 171 [20%] had severe disease). Of deaths, 66 (50%) were nursing home residents. Of 787 patients admitted with mild to moderate disease, 302 (38%) progressed to severe disease or death: 181 (60%) by day 2 and 238 (79%) by day 4. Patients had markedly different probabilities of disease progression on the basis of age, nursing home residence, comorbid conditions, obesity, respiratory symptoms, respiratory rate, fever, absolute lymphocyte count, hypoalbuminemia, troponin level, and C-reactive protein level and the interactions among these factors. Using only factors present on admission, a model to predict in-hospital disease progression had an area under the curve of 0.85, 0.79, and 0.79, at day 2, 4, and 7, respectively. LIMITATION: The study was done in a single health care system. CONCLUSION: A combination of demographic and clinical variables is strongly associated with severe COVID-19 disease or death and their early onset. The COVID-19 Inpatient Risk Calculator (CIRC), using factors present on admission, can inform clinical and resource allocation decisions.

Substantial progress has been made over the last decade in developing candidate preventive vaccines that can protect nonhuman primates against EBOV. Among these prospects, a vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is particularly robust, as it can also confer protection when administered as a postexposure treatment. A concern that has been raised regarding the replication-competent VSV vectors that express EBOV glycoproteins is how these vectors would be tolerated by individuals with altered or compromised immune systems such as patients infected with HIV. This is especially important as all EBOV outbreaks to date have occurred in areas of Central and Western Africa with high HIV incidence rates in the population. In order to address this concern, we evaluated the safety of the recombinant VSV vector expressing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (VSVG/ZEBOVGP) in six rhesus macaques infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). All six animals showed no evidence of illness associated with the VSVG/ZEBOVGP vaccine, suggesting that this vaccine may be safe in immunocompromised populations. While one goal of the study was to evaluate the safety of the candidate vaccine platform, it was also of interest to determine if altered immune status would affect vaccine efficacy. The vaccine protected 4 of 6 SHIV-infected macaques from death following ZEBOV challenge. Evaluation of CD4+ T cells in all animals showed that the animals that succumbed to lethal ZEBOV challenge had the lowest CD4+ counts, suggesting that CD4+ T cells may play a role in mediating protection against ZEBOV.","output":"Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-Based Ebola Vaccine Is Well-Tolerated and Protects Immunocompromised Nonhuman Primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To examine whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and whether there were differences by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection status among pregnant women. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study using Epic's Cosmos research platform, women who delivered during the pandemic (MarchCDecember 2020) were compared with those who delivered prepandemic (matched months 2017C2019). Within the pandemic epoch, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with those with negative test results or no SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Comparisons were performed using standardized differences, with a value greater than 0.1 indicating meaningful differences between groups. RESULTS: Among 838,489 women (225,225 who delivered during the pandemic), baseline characteristics were similar between epochs. There were no significant differences in adverse pregnancy outcomes between epochs (standardized difference<0.10). In the pandemic epoch, 108,067 (48.0%) women had SARS-CoV-2 testing available; of those, 7,432 (6.9%) had positive test results. Compared with women classified as negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were less likely to be non-Hispanic White or Asian or to reside in the Midwest and more likely to be Hispanic, have public insurance, be obese, and reside in the South or in high social vulnerability ZIP codes. There were no significant differences in the frequency of preterm birth (8.5% vs 7.6%, standardized difference=0.032), stillbirth (0.4% vs 0.4%, standardized difference=?0.002), small for gestational age (6.4% vs 6.5%, standardized difference=?0.002), large for gestational age (7.7% vs 7.7%, standardized difference=?0.001), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (16.3% vs 15.8%, standardized difference=0.014), placental abruption (0.5% vs 0.4%, standardized difference=0.007), cesarean birth (31.2% vs 29.4%, standardized difference=0.039), or postpartum hemorrhage (3.4% vs 3.1%, standardized difference=0.019) between those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and those classified as testing negative.

This tenuous shortage may touch various aspects but in the first place it will affect isolation and cohorting. In addition, this shortage will not only apply to acutely ill children with viral respiratory tract infections but all children with need for hospital care, either chronically ill or e.g. being premature babies or newborns. Therefore, approaches are required which on the one hand are based on pragmatic grounds but on the other hand fulfill the basics of hygiene and infection control. The recommendations proposed in this statement are intended to give assistance to hospitals for the management of testing, isolation and cohorting of pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. The most important factor navigating the essential measures is the cumulative incidence of newly diagnosed infections per 100,000 over the last 7 days, which is given by the RKI or the local public health authorities. In the situation of low (<25/100,000) or medium (25-50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and hospital admission can be performed under standard hygiene precautions and the children will be cohorted according to their clinical presentation until the results of SARS-CoV-2 test (or RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] or influenza test) are available. In the situation of high (>50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and the admission have to be performed under SARS-CoV-2 precautions as specified by the RKI, and the children have to be isolated until the results of SARS-CoV-2 test are available. The assessment of the incidence figures and the respective measures may be adapted by the local public health authorities on an individual basis.

However, the differential impact of the pandemic and lockdown on groups of individuals, and the personal characteristics associated with poorer outcomes are unknown. METHOD: Data from 21 938 adults in England who participated in a stratified cohort study were analysed. Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were identified using growth mixture modelling. Multinomial and logistic regression models were constructed to identify sociodemographic and personality-related risk factors associated with trajectory class membership. RESULTS: Four trajectories of depression and five for anxiety were identified. The most common group presented with low symptom severity throughout, other classes were identified that showed: severe levels of symptoms which increased; moderate symptoms throughout; worsening mental health during lockdown but improvements after lockdown ended; and for anxiety only, severe initial anxiety that decreased quickly during lockdown. Age, gender, ethnicity, income, previous diagnoses, living situation, personality factors and sociability were associated with different trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 30% of participants experienced trajectories with symptoms in the clinical range during lockdown, and did not follow the average curve or majority group, highlighting the importance of differential trajectories. Young, female, outgoing and sociable people and essential workers experienced severe anxiety around the announcement of lockdown which rapidly decreased.

METHODS: A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020) with a minimum of 60 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, procedure type, primary or revision, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 test status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. A subgroup of patients (n = 211) who had not presented to healthcare services after discharge were contacted and questioned as to whether they had symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Five (0.5%) of 1,073 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 postoperatively. When adjusting for confounding factors, increasing LOS (p = 0.022) was the only significant factor associated with developing COVID-19 following surgery and a stay greater than three days was a reliable predictor with an area under the curve of 81% (p = 0.018). There were three (0.3%) deaths in the study cohort and the overall mortality rate attributable to COVID-19 was 0.09% (n = 1/1,073), with one (20%) of the five patients with COVID-19 dying postoperatively. Of the 211 patients contacted, two had symptoms within two to 14 days postoperatively with a positive predictive value of 31% and it was therefore estimated that one patient may have had undiagnosed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The rate of postoperative COVID-19 was 0.5% and may have been as high as 1% when accounting for those patients not presenting to healthcare services, which was similar to the estimated population prevalence during the study period. The overall mortality rate secondary to COVID-19 was low (0.09%), however the mortality rate for those patients developing COVID-19 was 20%.","output":"The rate of COVID-19 and associated mortality after elective hip and knee arthroplasty prior to cessation of elective services in UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has emerged as one of the worst pandemics in recent history and has exposed the weaknesses of healthcare systems worldwide.

The discursive activity points to science as neutral, free, and independent of social influences captivating those already in this discursive sphere.

MethodsWe included routine attendance data from emergency departments who continuously transferred data between week 10-2017 and 10-2021, with ICD-10 codes available for >75% of the attendances. Case definitions for acute respiratory illness (ARI), severe ARI (SARI), influenza-like illness (ILI), respiratory syncytial virus disease (RSV) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were based on a combination of ICD-10 codes, and/or chief complaints, sometimes combined with information on hospitalisation and age. ResultsWe included 1,372,958 attendances from eight emergency departments. The number of attendances dropped in March 2020, increased during summer, and declined again during the resurge of COVID-19 cases in autumn and winter of 2020/2021. A pattern of seasonality of acute respiratory infections could be observed. By using different case definitions (i.e. for ARI, SARI, ILI, RSV) both the annual influenza seasons in the years 2017-2020 and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 were apparent. The absence of a flu season during the fall and winter of 2020/2021 was visible, in parallel to the resurge of COVID-19 cases. The proportion of SARI among ARI cases peaked in April-May 2020 and November 2020-January 2021.

METHODS Epidemiological surveillance at the C Foncello Hospital (Veneto, Italy) since 24 February 2020 to 24 April 2020 when the municipality of Treviso was hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. The number of naso-pharigeal (NP) swabs performed was 7010. RESULTS The number of infected among healthcare workers was 209/ 3924 (5.32%): medical doctors: 28 cases / 498 (5.6%). None among ophthalmologists; specialized nurses: 86/1294 (6.4%) None in the ophthalmic unit; intermediate care technicians: 68/463 (14.7%). The 46% of the positive tested were asymptomatic. We share key suggested actions for the reorganization in ophthalmological services: be part of a global epidemiological local strategy of containment (Testing, Tracing, Treating); protect your department: Keep on screening patients by telephone interview before entering the hospital; promote continuous and appropriate use of PPE both for doctors and for patients; make any effort to obtain a continuous flow of patients in every line of the ophthalmic service; treat appropriately any single patient with vision threatening condition; avoid unnecessary or futile testings and examinations. CONCLUSION The Treviso model shows that it is possible and safe to keep on performing high risk hospital activities like ophthalmology, even in the epicenter of covid outbreak, if adequate actions are performed.

The evidence around the application of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is still provisional, and further investigations are needed to confirm its eventual beneficial effects. Aims To assess the effect of TPE on the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia, using three statistical procedures to rule out any threats to validity. Methods We therefore carried out a single-centered retrospective observational non-placebo-controlled trial enrolling 73 inpatients from Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran (Iran) with the diagnosis of COVID-19-associated pneumonia confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs and high-resolution computerized tomography chest scan. These patients were broken down into two groups: Group 1 (30 patients) receiving standard care (corticosteroids, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, pantoprazole, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir), and Group 2 (43 patients) receiving the above regimen plus TPE (replacing 2 l of patients' plasma by a solution, 50% of normal plasma, and 50% of albumin at 5%) administered according to various time schedules. The follow-up time was 30 days and all-cause mortality was the endpoint. Results Deaths were 6 (14%) in Group 2 and 14 (47%) in Group 1. However, different harmful risk factors prevailed among patients not receiving TPE rather than being equally split between the intervention and control group. We used an algorithm of structural equation modeling (of STATA) to summarize a large pool of potential confounders into a single score (called with the descriptive name severity). Disease severity was lower (Wilkinson rank-sum test p < 0.001) among patients with COVID-19 undergoing TPE (median: ?2.82;range: ?5.18;7.96) as compared to those not receiving TPE (median: ?1.35;range: ?3.89;8.84), confirming that treatment assignment involved a selection bias of patients according to the severity of COVID-19 at hospital admission. The adjustment for confounding was carried out using severity as the covariate in Cox regression models. The univariate hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68 (95%CI: 0.26;1.80;p = 0.441) for TPE turned to 1.19 (95%CI: 0.43;3.29;p = 0.741) after adjusting for severity. Conclusions In this study sample, the lower mortality observed among patients receiving TPE was due to a lower severity of COVID-19 rather than the TPE effects.","output":"On Therapeutic Plasma Exchange Against Severe COVID-19-Associated Pneumonia: An Observational Clinical Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus outbreak has tested the adaptability, cooperation and organizational capabilities of our healthcare systems.

Whooping Cough and Parkinson' Disease. International Journal of Epidemiology 1996; 25: 1301C1311. BACKGROUND: We reported high levodopa use and prevalences of Parkinson's Disease (PD) in periodically, time-clustered, Icelandic cohorts born after major whooping cough epidemics (MWCE). METHODS: In order to quantify a possible relationship between age at first post-birth MWCE and risk of PD we: 1) calculated cumulative incidences of PD during the period 1954C1963 in one-year Icelandic cohorts born between 1869 and 1927, using raw material from a reported survey; 2) identified MWCE from 1869 onwards in Iceland; 3) estimated cohort ages at onset of incidence period and at first MWCE; and 4) combined the above-mentioned information using log-linear models. In addition, we studied the prevalence of levodopa users in Icelandic birth cohorts during a recent period. RESULTS: The curves of the above-mentioned incidences and prevalences in one-year birth-cohorts showed: 1) a similar, age-related, inverted V profile; and 2) a systematic notchy pattern, with peak values for one or both measurements for cohorts born during or after each of nine MWCE identified during the period 1869C1927. When 13 cohorts bom in years with MWCE were excluded from the analysis, the risk of PD rose with age at first defined MWCE, with the linear increase being 8.4% per year (95% Cl: ?0.1C18.3%). CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with reported effects of age at exposure in animal models of toxic parkinsonism, age-related changes in the dopamine receptor-GPT-binding protein-adenylatecyclase system observed in rats treated with pertussis toxin, and some PD epidemiological features. They suggest that pertussis neurotoxicity could be causally related to PD worldwide.","output":"Whooping Cough and Parkinson's Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a modified reproducing kernel algorithm is proposed to solve a class of quadratic and cubic logistic equations with Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative in Hilbert space.

The stability, convergence, and complexity of the proposed approach are discussed. Furthermore, the effects of the Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivatives are studied in solving the population growth model comparing with those of the classical Caputo derivatives. The main motivation for using the proposed technique is high accuracy and low computational cost compared to other existing methods especially when involving fractional differentiation operators. In this orientation, the effectiveness, applicability, and feasibility of this technique are verified by numerical examples.

We examine public opinion toward universal health coverage policies in this context. METHODS Through a survey of 1,211 Americans in June 2020, we examine the influence of health insurance loss on support for Medicare for All (M4A) in two ways. First, we examine associations between pandemic-related health insurance loss and M4A support. Second, we experimentally prime some respondents with a vignette of a sympathetic victim losing employer-sponsored coverage during COVID-19. As a secondary outcome, we examine the effect of these exposures on support for the Affordable Care Act. FINDINGS We find that directly experiencing recent health insurance loss is strongly associated (10 pp, p<0.01) with greater M4A support. Experimental exposure to the vignette increases M4A support by 6 pp (p=0.05). When expansion of the ACA is added as a response option, experimental priming still increases support for M4A, but direct experience of insurance loss is associated with greater support for the ACA than for M4A. CONCLUSIONS In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, situational framings can induce modest change in support for M4A, especially among individuals without well-formed preferences. However, real-world health insurance losses are associated with larger differences in support for M4A and with greater support for existing safety net policies such as the ACA.

The pandemic also caused delayed detection of new-onset diabetes in children; this increased the risk and severity of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We therefore investigated the frequency of new-onset pediatric T1DM and DKA in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared it to the same period in 2019. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged 1-14 years admitted with new-onset T1DM or DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) and the same period in 2019. We assessed factors including age, sex, anthropometric measures, nationality, duration of diabetes, diabetes management, HbA1c levels, glycemic control, cause of admission, blood gas levels, etiology of DKA, DKA complications, length of hospital stay, and COVID-19 test status. Result: During the lockdown, 106 children, compared with 154 in 2019, were admitted to 6 pediatric diabetes centers. Among the admissions, DKA was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (83% vs. 73%; P=0.05; risk ratio=1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.26), after adjusting for age and sex. DKA frequency among new-onset T1DM and HbA1c levels at diagnosis were higher in 2020 than in 2019 (26% vs. 13.4% [P=<0.001] and 12.1  0.2 vs. 10.8  0.25 [P<0.001], respectively). Females and older patients had a higher risk of DKA. Conclusion: The lockdown implemented in Saudi Arabia has significantly impacted children with T1DM and led to an increased DKA frequency, including children with new-onset T1DM, potentially owing to delayed presentation.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown on the Incidence of New-Onset Type 1 Diabetes and Ketoacidosis Among Saudi Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of COVID-19, university students have experienced fundamental changes of their learning and their lives as a whole.

We highlight key questions that serologic studies can help answer at different times, review strengths and limitations of different assay types and study designs, and discuss methods for rapid sharing and analysis of serologic data to determine global transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","output":"Seroepidemiologic Study Designs for Determining SARS-COV-2 Transmission and Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of mortality, hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life and a major burden for the healthcare system. The number of patients that progress to an advanced stage of HF is growing. Only a limited proportion of these patients can undergo heart transplantation or mechanical circulatory support. The purpose of this review is to summarize medical management of patients with advanced HF. First, evidence\\\\based oral treatment must be implemented although it is often not tolerated. New therapeutic options may soon become possible for these patients. The second goal is to lessen the symptomatic burden through both decongestion and haemodynamic improvement. Some new treatments acting on cardiac function may fulfil both these needs. Inotropic agents acting through an increase in intracellular calcium have often increased risk of death. However, in the recent Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure (GALACTIC\\\\HF) trial, omecamtiv mecarbil was safe and effective in the reduction of the primary outcome of cardiovascular death or HF event compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.86C0.99; P = 0.03) and its effects were larger in those patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with severe HF who received omecamtiv mecarbil experienced a significant treatment benefit, whereas patients without severe HF did not (P = 0.005 for interaction). Lastly, clinicians should take care of the end of life with an appropriate multidisciplinary approach.

There are no published data pertaining to changes in cerebral oxygenation seen with increases in the inspired oxygen fraction or end-tidal carbon dioxide in patients anesthetized in the beach chair position. Furthermore, the effect anesthetic agents have has not been thoroughly investigated in this context. We plan to test the hypothesis that changes in inspired oxygen fraction or end-tidal carbon dioxide correlate to a significant change in regional cerebral oxygenation in anesthetized patients in beach chair position. We will also compare the effects that inhaled and intravenous anesthetics have on this process. METHODS/DESIGN This is a prospective within-group study of patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy in the beach chair position which incorporates a randomized comparison between two anesthetics, approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The primary outcome measure is the change in regional cerebral oxygenation due to sequential changes in oxygenation and ventilation. A sample size of 48 will have greater than 80% power to detect an absolute 4-5% difference in regional cerebral oxygenation caused by changes in ventilation strategy. The secondary outcome is the effect of anesthetic choice on cerebral desaturation in the beach chair position or response to changes in ventilation strategy. Fifty-four patients will be recruited, allowing for drop out, targeting 24 patients in each group randomized to an anesthetic. Regional cerebral oxygenation will be measured using the INVOS 5100C monitor (Covidien, Boulder, CO). Following induction of anesthesia, intubation and positioning, inspired oxygen fraction and minute ventilation will be sequentially adjusted. At each set point, regional cerebral oxygenation will be recorded and venous blood gas analysis performed. The overall statistical analysis will use a repeated measures analysis of variance with Tukey's HSD procedure for post hoc contrasts. DISCUSSION If simple maneuvers of ventilation or anesthetic technique can prevent cerebral hypoxia, patient outcome may be improved. This is the first study to investigate the effects of ventilation strategies on cerebral oxygenation in patients anesthetized in beach chair position.

This commentary seeks to discuss the importance of linguistic literacy and communication imperatives in the context of access to palliative care, given the broad, diversified and sensitive scope of care. While the pandemic has demonstrated that the public health responses of migrant host societies are deeply intertwined with policies as well as local rules and constraints, the promotion and provision of safe, timely and appropriate palliative care can be achieved through a sensitive assessment of differential contexts of diversity.

METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective analysis of 6,439 patients admitted for COVID-19 at 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27 and June 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes (length of stay, need for intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality) were captured from electronic health records. For patients identified as having a history of HF by International Classification of Diseases-9th and/or 10th Revisions codes, manual chart abstraction informed etiology, functional class, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). RESULTS: Mean age was 63.5 years, and 45% were women. Compared with patients without HF, those with previous HF experienced longer length of stay (8 days vs. 6 days; p < 0.001), increased risk of mechanical ventilation (22.8% vs. 11.9%; adjusted odds ratio: 3.64; 95% confidence interval: 2.56 to 5.16; p < 0.001), and mortality (40.0% vs. 24.9%; adjusted odds ratio: 1.88; 95% confidence interval: 1.27 to 2.78; p = 0.002).

METHODS: Our search was including original articles, reviews, guidelines, letters to the editor, comments on guidelines, and editorials, regarding the male reproductive system. We used the words SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, 2019 ncov, testis, sperm, male factor infertility, fertility treatment, semen, assisted reproductive technology (ART), sexual transmission, and ACE2. RESULTS: Data showed coronavirus affects men more than women because of more expression of 2019 nCoV receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in testicular cells. Also, Bioinformatics Analysis suggests that sperm production may be damaged, since Pseudo Time Analysis has shown disruption in spermatogenesis. Gene Ontology (GO) showed an increase in viral reproduction and a decrease in sperm production-related terms. Recently, SARS-COV-2 mRNA and protein were detected in the semen of patients that had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the probable disruption of blood-testis barrier (BTB) in febrile diseases is suspected in the acute phase of the disease enabling viral entry into the testes. Not only is spermatogenesis disturbed, but also disturbs gonadotropin, androgens, and testosterone secretion during SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sexual transmission has been reported yet; however, detection of the virus in semen still makes the sexual transmission an open question. CONCLUSION: There is a concern that male fertility may be disturbed after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, follow-up of the reproductive functions and male fertility may be necessary in recovered cases, especially in aged men.","output":"The probable destructive mechanisms behind COVID-19 on male reproduction system and fertility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine whether disease severity varied according to whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients had multiple or single cardiovascular diseases and risk factors (CVDRFs).Methodsa??anda??Results:COVID-19 patients with single (n=281) or multiple (n=412) CVDRFs were included retrospectively.

DESIGN: A mixed methods approach, comprising a rapid literature review, one-to-one, semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, a multidisciplinary stakeholder workshop, and a post-workshop survey. SETTING: United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 32 key stakeholders across the medical device sector were identified both from the public and private sectors. RESULTS: Opportunities relating to regulatory independence were identified, including the potential to create and implement a regulatory framework that ensures availability of medical devices; innovation and investment potential; and safety to the citizens of the UK. The most significant risks identified included threats to the safety of individual patients and the wider health system arising from the delay in awaiting regulatory approval due to the shortage of approved bodies; and reduced competitiveness of UK market and device manufacturers. Recommendations were identified to mitigate risks, centred on harnessing broader cross-sector collaborations, promoting patient and public partnership, and maximizing international engagement.

The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory for a central agency are to be allocated.

The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID\\\\19 pandemic by FEMA to different U.S. states. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non\\\\COVID\\\\19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20 000 ventilators (as of March 23, 2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs in slightly above average demand scenarios. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non\\\\COVID\\\\19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In a severe case, where the demand is concentrated in the top\\\\most quartile of the forecast confidence interval and states are not willing to share their stockpile of ventilators, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (until May 31, 2020) is about 232 000 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 17 200 ventilators on April 19, 2020. Results are also reported for a worst\\\\case where the demand is at the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval.

More than 1.3 million of the 4 million cases of COVID-19 confirmed globally as of May 2020 have been identified in the United States, testing the capacity and resilience of our hospitals and health care workers. The impacts of the ongoing pandemic, caused by a novel strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have far-reaching implications for the future of our health care system and how we deliver routine care to patients. The adoption of social distancing during this pandemic has demonstrated efficacy in controlling the spread of this virus and has been the only proven means of infection control thus far. Social distancing has prompted hospital closures and the reduction of all non-COVID clinical visits, causing widespread financial despair to many outpatient centers. However, the need to treat patients for non-COVID problems remains important despite this pandemic, as care must continue to be delivered to patients despite their ability or desire to report to outpatient centers for their general care. Our national health care system has realized this need and has incentivized providers to adopt distance-based care in the form of telemedicine and video medicine visits. Many institutions have since incorporated these into their practices without financial penalty because of Medicare's 1135 waiver, which currently reimburses telemedicine at the same rate as evaluation and management codes (E/M Codes). Although the financial burden has been alleviated by this policy, the practitioner remains accountable for providing proper assessment with this new modality of health care delivery. This is a challenge for most physicians, so our team of national experts has created a reference guide for musculoskeletal and neurologic examination selection to retrofit into the telemedicine experience. OBJECTIVES: To describe and illustrate musculoskeletal and neurologic examination techniques that can be used effectively in telemedicine. STUDY DESIGN: Consensus-based multispecialty guidelines. SETTING: Tertiary care center. METHODS: Literature review of the neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, lumbar, hip, and knee physical examinations were performed. A multidisciplinary team comprised of physical medicine and rehabilitation, orthopedics, rheumatology, neurology, and anesthesia experts evaluated each examination and provided consensus opinion to select the examinations most appropriate for telemedicine evaluation. The team also provided consensus opinion on how to modify some examinations to incorporate into a nonhealth care office setting. RESULTS: Sixty-nine examinations were selected by the consensus team. Household objects were identified that modified standard and validated examinations, which could facilitate the examinations.The consensus review team did not believe that the modified tests altered the validity of the standardized tests. LIMITATIONS: Examinations selected are not validated for telemedicine. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were not performed.

The vaccines currently available on the market elicit only limited protection. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replicon particles (VRP) have been used successfully to induce protection against influenza A virus (IAV) in chickens and bluetongue virus in sheep. In this study, VSV VRP expressing the PRRSV envelope proteins GP5, M, GP4, GP3, GP2 and the nucleocapsid protein N, individually or in combination, were generated and evaluated as a potential vector vaccine against PRRSV infection. High level expression of the recombinant PRRSV proteins was demonstrated in cell culture. However, none of the PRRSV antigens expressed from VRP, with the exception of the N protein, did induce any detectable antibody response in pigs before challenge infection with PRRSV. After challenge however, the antibody responses against GP5, GP4 and GP3 appeared in average 2 weeks earlier than in pigs vaccinated with the empty control VRP. No reduction of viremia was observed in the vaccinated group compared with the control group. When pigs were co-vaccinated with VRP expressing IAV antigens and VRP expressing PRRSV glycoproteins, only antibody responses to the IAV antigens were detectable. These data show that the VSV replicon vector can induce immune responses to heterologous proteins in pigs, but that the PRRSV envelope proteins expressed from VSV VRP are poorly immunogenic. Nevertheless, they prime the immune system for significantly earlier B-cell responses following PRRSV challenge infection.","output":"Virus replicon particles expressing porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus proteins elicit immune priming but do not confer protection from viremia in pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and global lockdowns fundamentally changed families' everyday lives This study aims to examine how families with children coped during the COVID-19 lockdown in Finland and what kind of coping strategies they developed An online survey including both qualitative and quantitative questions was conducted between April and May 2020 to gather Finnish families' experiences during the COVID-19 lockdown In this study, we focus on information from one open-ended question, and Huston's social-ecological theory was used as an analytical framework The results showed that Finnish families employed coping strategies on three levels: macroenvironmental, relationship, and individual This supports the argument that to better understand families' coping strategies, the macrosocietal environment surrounding families, their relationships, and the interactions between family members, as well as individual decisions and attitudes, should be taken into account","output":"Family Coping Strategies During Finland's COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By late March 2020, Villa Caldari, a small village of the municipality of Ortona (Abruzzo region), was registering an incidence rate of COVID-19 cases ten times greater than the overall municipality and was declared a hotspot area Twenty-two days later, epidemiological investigation and sampling were performed, to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 circulation and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies Overall, 681 nasopharyngeal swabs and 667 blood samples were collected Only one resident of the village resulted in being positive for RNA viral shedding, while 73 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies The overall seroprevalence was 10 9% The difference between the seroprevalence of infection in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals was significant (&chi;2 = 14 50 p-value = 0 0001) Amongst the residents positive for antibodies, fatigue and/or muscle pain, fever and anosmia were the most experienced symptoms, whose most frequent onset was observed during the first two weeks of March Familial and habit-related clusters were highlighted Nevertheless, the investigations showed a low SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the village at the time of the sampling, demonstrating virus transmission could be limited when strict emergency measures are followed Given the favorable results, the emergency measures were then lifted","output":"A COVID-19 Hotspot Area: Activities and Epidemiological Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid and sustained disinfection of surfaces is necessary to check communicability of microbial.

We detected IgG against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, neutralizing antibodies against the reference Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain and used SARS-CoV-2 peptides to detect IFN-g and IL-2 specific T cell responses in a group of CoronaVac vaccinated individuals (N = 101) and convalescent (N = 72) individuals. The frequency among vaccinated individuals, of whom 96% displayed T cell and/or antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, is comparable to 98.5% responses of convalescent individuals.

This paper examines this hypothesis by analyzing how the time fathers and mothers spent with their children changed during the first lockdown in the case of Germany. METHODS Data for this investigation come from the German Socio-Economic Panel. The outcome variable is the time spent on childcare tasks. We investigate how this time changed between 2019 and spring 2020 and how these patterns differed by gender, education, and employment situation. As a method, we employ linear panel regressions where the dependent variable is the change in childcare time between the two survey years. RESULTS We find that fathers and mothers expanded the time they spent on childcare to similar degrees between 2019 and spring 2020, which marks the period of the first lockdown. However, we also observe large differences by level of education. We find that men with low and medium levels of education spent more time with their children than they did before the onset of the crisis. CONTRIBUTION Our study provides novel evidence on the effect of the coronavirus crisis on fathers' involvement in childcare. Contrary to expectations based on previous research, we find that fathers expanded the time they were spending with their children during the first lockdown. While we also find that women continue to perform the bulk of childcare tasks, our results cast a positive light on the potential of paternal involvement in contemporary societies.","output":"Coronavirus and care: How the coronavirus crisis affected fathers' involvement in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global challenge for public health systems.

However, RPM is a complex, multilevel intervention with technology, workflow, contextual and patient experience components. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of RPM protocol implementation with respect to decentralised recruitment, patient retention, adherence to reporting recommendations, RPM platform usability and patient experience in ambulatory cancer patients at high risk for chemotherapy-related symptoms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a single-arm decentralised feasibility pilot study of technology-enhanced outpatient symptom management system in patients with gastrointestinal and thoracic cancer receiving chemotherapy and cancer care at a single site (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston Texas). An anticipated total of 25 patients will be recruited prior to the initiation of chemotherapy and provided with a set of validated questionnaires at enrollment and after our 1-month feasibility pilot trial period. Our intervention entails the self-reporting of symptoms and vital signs via a HIPAA-compliant, secure tablet interface that also enables (1) the provision of self-care materials to patients, (2) generation of threshold alerts to a dedicated call-centre and (3) videoconferencing. Vital sign information (heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, weight and temperature) will be captured via Bluetooth-enabled biometric monitoring devices which are integrated with the tablet interface. Protocolised triage and management of symptoms will occur in response to the alerts. Feasibility and acceptability metrics will characterise our recruitment process, protocol adherence, patient retention and usability of the RPM platform. We will also document the perceived effectiveness of our intervention by patients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been granted approval by the institutional review board of MD Anderson Cancer Center. We anticipate dissemination of our pilot and subsequent effectiveness trial results via presentations at national conferences and peer-reviewed publications in the relevant medical journals.

In recent years, dietary polyphenols have gained significant interest among researchers due to their potential chemopreventive/protective functions in the maintenance of human health and diseases. It is believed that dietary polyphenols/flavonoids exert powerful antioxidant action for protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS)/cellular oxidative stress (OS) towards the prevention of OS-related pathological conditions or diseases. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence strongly suggest that long term consumption of diets rich in polyphenols offer protection against the development of various chronic diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, diabetes, inflammatory disorders and infectious illness. Increased intake of foods containing polyphenols (for example, quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, resveratrol, cyanidin etc.) has been claimed to reduce the extent of a majority of chronic oxidative cellular damage, DNA damage, tissue inflammations, viral/bacterial infections, and neurodegenerative diseases. It has been suggested that the antioxidant activity of dietary polyphenols plays a pivotal role in the prevention of OS-induced human diseases. In this narrative review, the biological/pharmacological significance of dietary polyphenols in the prevention of and/or protection against OS-induced major human diseases such as cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, CVDs, diabetes mellitus, cancer, inflammatory disorders and infectious diseases have been delineated.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a transparent deep learning (DL) model predict the need for MV in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19 up to 24 h in advance? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We trained and externally validated a transparent DL algorithm to predict the future need for MV in hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19, using commonly available data in electronic health records. Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, Fio(2), and pH) were used to assess future need for MV. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. RESULTS: We obtained data from more than 30,000 ICU patients (including more than 700 patients with COVID-19) from two academic medical centers. The performance of the model with a 24-h prediction horizon at the development and validation sites was comparable (AUC, 0.895 vs 0.882, respectively), providing significant improvement over traditional clinical criteria (P < .001). Prospective validation of the algorithm among patients with COVID-19 yielded AUCs in the range of 0.918 to 0.943.

Currently, GL is used to treat hepatitis and allergic disease worldwide because of its anti-viral and anti-allergy effects. In addition to these prominent functions, GL likely regulates cellular functions such as tumor cell growth and cellular immunity. However, how GL affects the keratinocyte inflammation response remains poorly understood. The current paper investigates the effect of GL on psoriasis and explores the mechanisms involved. METHODS We used an in vitro cell model of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)--induced keratinocyte inflammation and the topical application of imiquimod (IMQ) using an animal model (mouse skin) of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like inflammation (IPI) to investigate the effect of GL on skin inflammation. Cell viability was analyzed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8). Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeling was used to trace monocyte adherence to keratinocytes. A Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-B/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. A modified version of the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) was used to monitor disease severity. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to observe pathological changes. An immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was used to detect ICAM-1 expression in mouse skin. RESULTS GL treatment significantly reduced the levels of ICAM-1 in TNF--stimulated HaCaT cells, inhibited subsequent monocyte adhesion to keratinocytes, and suppressed the nuclear translation and phosphorylation of p65 following the degradation of inhibitor B (IB). GL treatment blocked the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/p38 MAPK. GL effectively delayed the onset of IPI in mice and ameliorated ongoing IPI, thereby reducing ICAM-1 expression in epidermal tissues. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that GL treatment ameliorates skin inflammation by inhibiting ICAM-1 expression via interference with the ERK/p38 MAPK and NF-B signaling pathways in keratinocytes. Therefore, GL can be used as an anti-psoriasis drug.","output":"Glycyrrhizin ameliorates imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin lesions in BALB/c mice and inhibits TNF--induced ICAM-1 expression via NF-B/MAPK in HaCaT cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospitals and health systems have only now started to realize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of nursing care.

For the first model, a Lagrangian relaxation approach is proposed which provides a mean for comparing the operational cost and carbon footprint performance of the carbon tax and the carbon cap policies. Subsequently, a Bisection based algorithm is developed to solve the relaxed model and generate the optimal ordering policy. The second model, however, is solved via a dynamic programming based algorithm while respecting two established lower and upper bounds on the periodic carbon cap. The results of the computational experiments for the first model display a stepwise increase (decrease) in the total carbon emissions (operational cost) as the preset cap value is increased.

However, despite significant progress on elucidating the function of key proteins involved in reproduction, understanding male reproductive physiology is limited by incomplete information on the genes expressed in reproductive tissues, and no contraceptive targets have so far reached clinical trials. To advance product development, further identification of novel reproductive tract-specific genes leading to potentially druggable protein targets is imperative. RESULTS: In this study, we expand on previous single tissue, single species studies by integrating analysis of publicly available human and mouse RNA-seq datasets whose initial published purpose was not focused on identifying male reproductive tract-specific targets. We also incorporate analysis of additional newly acquired human and mouse testis and epididymis samples to increase the number of targets identified. We detected a combined total of 1178 genes for which no previous evidence of male reproductive tract-specific expression was annotated, many of which are potentially druggable targets. Through RT-PCR, we confirmed the reproductive tract-specific expression of 51 novel orthologous human and mouse genes without a reported mouse model. Of these, we ablated four epididymis-specific genes (Spint3, Spint4, Spint5, and Ces5a) and two testis-specific genes (Pp2d1 and Saxo1) in individual or double knockout mice generated through the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our results validate a functional requirement for Spint4/5 and Ces5a in male mouse fertility, while demonstrating that Spint3, Pp2d1, and Saxo1 are each individually dispensable for male mouse fertility.

CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is related to changes in the quantity and nature of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep among children and youth. There is an urgent need for policy makers, practitioners, and researchers to develop solutions for attenuating adverse changes in physical activity and screen time among children and youth.","output":"Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the movement behaviors of children and youth: A scoping review of evidence after the first year"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic induced many governments to provide financial assistance to households. Using representative consumer surveys conducted during the pandemic in 2020, we examine the effects of this fiscal policy instrument on households in two emerging economies, Thailand and Vietnam. Our paper contributes to the literature by studying how consumer sentiment and durable spending relate to receiving government financial support and the underlying transmission channels for these responses. We find that financial support to households is related to more positive consumer sentiment and increases in actual and planned durable spending, while also being correlated with a more optimistic macroeconomic outlook, higher trust in the government, and higher personal well-being.","output":"The Effects of Fiscal Policy on Households During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Thailand and Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The oral cavity is inhabited by a wide spectrum of microbial species, and their colonization is mostly based on commensalism. These microbes are part of the normal oral flora, but there are also opportunistic species that can cause oral and systemic diseases. Although there is a strong exposure to various microorganisms, the oral mucosa reduces the colonization of microorganisms with high rotation and secretion of various types of cytokines and antimicrobial proteins such as defensins. In some circumstances, the imbalance between normal oral flora and pathogenic flora may lead to a change in the ratio of commensalism to parasitism. Healthy oral mucosa has many important functions. Thanks to its integrity, it is impermeable to most microorganisms and constitutes a mechanical barrier against their penetration into tissues. Our study aims to present the role and composition of the oral cavity microbiota as well as defense mechanisms within the oral mucosa which allow for maintaining a balance between such numerous species of microorganisms. We highlight the specific aspects of the oral mucosa protecting barrier and discuss up-to-date information on the immune cell system that ensures microbiota balance. This study presents the latest data on specific tissue stimuli in the regulation of the immune system with particular emphasis on the resistance of the gingival barrier. Despite advances in understanding the mechanisms regulating the balance on the microorganism/host axis, more research is still needed on how the combination of these diverse signals is involved in the regulation of immunity at the oral mucosa barrier.","output":"Armed to the TeethThe Oral Mucosa Immunity System and Microbiota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measures implemented to combat the spread of COVID-19 have included stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and self-isolation, all of which have limited in-person interactions. Given the key role of technology in maintaining social connections during this period, the current study examined the experiences of young adults who shifted from predominantly offline to online interaction with friends during COVID-19. Specifically, we investigated whether changing from interacting predominantly with friends in-person to interacting predominantly with friends online (conceptualized as a major change in context of interaction) was associated with lower social well-being (i.e., greater loneliness and lower social connectedness), and examined whether perceived changes in friendship satisfaction as a result of the pandemic mediated these effects. Participants (N = 329;68.1% female) were Australian young adults, aged between 17 and 25 years (Mage = 20.05 years, SD = 1.97). Data were collected between April 15th and May 24th, 2020, during the nationwide lockdown in Australia. Results indicated that for young adults who primarily interacted offline with friends prior to COVID-19 (as compared to those who interacted predominantly online or equally online and offline before the pandemic), the shift away from face-to-face interactions was associated with a greater perceived reduction in satisfaction with friendships, which, in turn, was associated with greater loneliness and lower social connectedness. Our results highlight the need to consider how young adults adjust to changes in contexts for engaging with friends and how they maintain meaningful social interactions with others during times of extended physical isolation.

However, it has the disadvantage of a long turnaround time and cost. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) formulated a case definition for COVID-19. We sought to determine the utility of a 14-item, point-weighted clinical screening questionnaire adapted from the NCDC case definition in identifying patients more likely to have the disease. This was to aid prompt clinical decision-making. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 113 non-surgical patients presenting to the Accident and Emergency Department (A and E) of Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Lagos, Nigeria. Patients were stratified based on screening scores into low (0-2), moderate (3-5) and high (6) pre-test categories. Patients with low and high scores 6 were admitted to the A and E and the COVID-19 holding ward, respectively, while the moderate group had chest computed tomography scans to aid further decision-making, pending the outcome of their RT-PCR results. The validity of the triage score as compared to the RT-PCR test result was calculated and the kappa score of agreement was utilised to evaluate the concordance between two triage scores. The optimum cut-off score was also obtained based on the maximal Younden's index. Results: The frequencies of low, moderate and high pre-test scores were 34 (30%), 43 (38.1%) and 36 (31.9%), respectively. Overall, 38.1% (43/113) were RT-PCR positive. RT-PCR was positive in 26.5% (9/34) with low screening scores, 55.8% (24/43) with moderate scores and 27.8% (10/36) with high scores. The sensitivity and specificity of a high score of 6 were 25% and 92.86%, while the lower score of 3 had sensitivity and specificity of 62.5% and 58.6%, respectively. Conclusion: The screening tool showed a high specificity in its initial design, which suggests that anyone with a low score using this tool has a high probability of testing negative. We recommend a cut-off score of 4 (score A) or 6 (score B) of the current screening tool be used to increase the chances of identifying persons with COVID-19 for RT-PCR testing.","output":"Assessment of the utility of a screening tool for COVID-19 diagnosis in an accident and emergency department in Lagos, Nigeria: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Palmar hyperhidrosis represents a condition with a significant cosmetic and psychological burden.

The purpose of this article is to analyze the effect of public health interventions on respiratory tract infection-related visits to pediatric emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. Method: Pediatric emergency department visits between January 1 2020 and April 30 2020 were included for trend analysis and compared to the same period during the past 3 years. The datasets were retrieved from Taiwan National Infectious Disease Statistics System and Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Respiratory tract infections with other diagnoses categories, including fever, asthma, and urinary tract infections, were included for subgroup analysis. Result: A significant decrease of more than 50% in respiratory tract infection-related visits was found from February to April 2020 in the national database. With regard to diagnosis category, the proportion of respiratory tract infections in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Hospital also became significantly lower in 2020 during the months of March (43.4 vs. 37.4%, p = 0.024) and April (40.1 vs. 32.2%, p < 0.001). On the other hand, the proportion of urinary tract infections was significantly higher in 2020 during March (3.7 vs. 5.2%, p = 0.033) and April (3.9 vs. 6.5%, p < 0.001), and that of asthma was also higher in April (1.6 vs. 2.6%, p = 0.025). Furthermore, the intensive care unit admission rate was relatively higher in 2020 from February, with significant differences noted in March (1.3 vs. 2.8%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Due to public health interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic, the transmission of not only COVID-19 but also other air droplet transmitted diseases in children may have been effectively prevented.","output":"Public Health Interventions for the COVID-19 Pandemic Reduce Respiratory Tract Infection-Related Visits at Pediatric Emergency Departments in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents the main research results on the peculiarities of the functioning of agricultural cooperatives and the practices of state regulation of their activities in the countries of the European Union. The high importance of agricultural cooperatives is justified, first of all, by their multifunctionality, and, consequently, by their contribution both to the development of the agricultural economy and to the stability of rural areas. The main trends in the development of agricultural cooperation in Europe are: (1) the enlargement of the cooperative business;(2) the development of vertical integration along the technological chain, (3) all kinds of organizational innovations to expand financial opportunities, (4) strengthening competitiveness through the growth of the scale of activities and all kinds of innovations, (5) socialization of cooperative activities in order to improve the living conditions of rural communities. The specificity of state support for European agricultural cooperatives lies in expanding the range of mechanisms and instruments used by the state, providing financial assistance mainly to small regional cooperatives (performing functions important for rural areas), taking into account the possibilities of cooperative activities under extraordinary conditions (such as the COVID-19 pandemic or emerging natural cataclysms).","output":"Agricultural cooperatives in Europe: importance for rural development, government support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the World Health Organization, development of the COVID-19 vaccine is occurring in record time.

Bacteria and fungi are known to be inactivated not only by ultraviolet radiation but also by visible light. Several studies have recently appeared on this subject, in which viruses were mainly irradiated in media. However, it is an open question to what extent the applied media, and especially their riboflavin concentration, can influence the results. A literature search identified appropriate virus photoinactivation publications and, where possible, viral light susceptibility was quantitatively determined in terms of average log-reduction doses. Sensitivities of enveloped viruses were plotted against assumed riboflavin concentrations. Viruses appear to be sensitive to visible (violet/blue) light. The median log-reduction doses of all virus experiments performed in liquids is 58 J/cm2. For the non-enveloped, enveloped and coronaviruses only, they were 222, 29 and 19 J/cm2, respectively. Data are scarce, but it appears that (among other things) the riboflavin concentration in the medium has an influence on the log-reduction doses. Experiments with DMEM, with its 0.4 mg/L riboflavin, have so far produced results with the greatest viral susceptibilities. It should be critically evaluated whether the currently published virus sensitivities are really only intrinsic properties of the virus, or whether the medium played a significant role.

Dexamethasone has been reported to reduce PONV. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of dexmedetomidine in decreasing PONV. This study was designed to compare the effects of a single dose of dexmedetomidine to dexamethasone for reducing PONV after LC. METHODS Eighty-six adult patients scheduled for LC were randomized to receive either single dose 1 g/kg of dexmedetomidine (Dexmed group, N = 43) or 8 mg dexamethasone (Dexa group, N = 43) before skin incision. During the first 24 h postoperatively, the incidence and severity of PONV were assessed. Pain and sedation scores were assessed on arrival in the recovery room and early postoperatively. Analgesic and antiemetic consumption during the 24 h after surgery were calculated. Intra-operative and postoperative hemodynamics were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-one percent of the patients in the Dexmed group developed PONV compared to 28% in the Dexa group (P = 0.6). Severity of PONV was similar between the two groups (P = 0.07). Early postoperatively, pain severity was significantly lower in the Dexmed group, but sedation scores were significantly higher. The first analgesic request was significantly delayed in the Dexmed group (P = 0.02). The total amounts of intraoperative fentanyl and postoperative tramadol administered were significantly lower in the Dexmed group. No difference in ondansetron was noted between the two groups. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly lower in the Dexmed group after administration of dexmedetomidine. No major side effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS Dexmedetomidine reduces the incidence and severity of PONV, similar to dexamethasone.

METHODS: We included all 260 patients with COVID\\\\19 admitted to nine ICUs at the Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden) between 9 March and 20 April 2020. Primary outcome was in\\\\hospital mortality among patients with definite outcomes (discharged from ICU or death), as of 30 April 2020 (study end point). Secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay, the proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy, and hospital discharge destination. RESULTS: Of 260 ICU patients with COVID\\\\19, 208 (80.0%) were men, the median age was 59 (IQR 51\\\\65) years, 154 (59.2%) had at least one comorbidity, and the median duration of symptoms preceding ICU admission was 11 (IQR 8\\\\14) days. Sixty\\\\two (23.8%) patients remained in ICU at study end point. Among the 198 patients with definite outcomes, ICU length of stay was 12 (IQR, 6\\\\18) days, 163 (82.3%) received mechanical ventilation, 28 (14.1%) received renal replacement therapy, 60 (30.3%) died, 62 (31.3%) were discharged home, 47 (23.7%) were discharged to ward, and 29 (14.6%) were discharged to another health care facility. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, older age and admission from the emergency department was associated with higher mortality.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) seem to be an appealing alternative to chemotherapy, especially in elderly patients, due to a more tolerable toxicity profile, they can lead to a peculiar variety of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). However, data on tolerability and outcome of ICIs in the elderly are lacking due to poor accrual in clinical trials of these patients. Methods: We performed a retro-prospective analysis on patients treated with single agent anti-PD-L1/PD-1 at the Clinical Oncology Unit, Careggi University Hospital, from March 2016 to March 2020. Data on the treatment responses, type and severity of irAEs, as well as the corticosteroids (CCS) dosage used for irAEs and the discontinuation rate, were described per each patient, according to two different age-based cohorts of patients (< or 70 years). Results: We reported a lower incidence of all-grade toxicity in elderly compared to younger patients (64.9% vs. 44.9%, p = 0.018). The two age-cohorts showed a different profile of irAEs. Endocrine irAEs were significantly higher in younger patients (39.7% vs. 21.7%, p = 0.002), while dermatologic toxicities were more common in the older group (35.0% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.047). Use of CCS and treatment discontinuation rate do not differ significantly between the two age groups. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that treatment with ICIs in elderly populations is safe and feasible.

A change in the pattern of laboratory test results in COVID-19 patients over this time has not been reported or correlated with patient outcome. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of routine laboratory and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results from 5,785 patients evaluated in a NYC hospital emergency department from March to June employing machine learning analysis. Results: A COVID-19 high-risk laboratory test result profile (COVID19-HRP), consisting of 21 routine blood tests, was identified to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 patients. Approximately half of the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had the distinct COVID19-HRP that separated them from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. SARS-CoV-2 patients with the COVID19-HRP had higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, determined by cycle-threshold values from the RT-PCR, and poorer clinical outcome compared to other positive patients without COVID19-HRP. Furthermore, the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 patients with the COVID19-HRP has significantly decreased from March/April to May/June. Notably, viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 patients declined and their laboratory profile became less distinguishable from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients in the later phase. Conclusions: Our study visualized the down-trending of the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 patients with the distinct COVID19-HRP.

In addition to reversal of inspiratory-expiratory ratios, this pressure control mode also allows unrestricted spontaneous breathing. The spontaneous tidal volume (V(T)), as well as the V(T) resulting from transition between the high and low airway pressures, is uncontrolled. There are limited data on the within-patient variation of actual V(T) and the safety of these modes. The authors present a patient with severe ARDS who was managed with biphasic modes (APRV and bi-level positive airway pressure). Serial V(T) measurements showed that V(T) ranged from 4 to 12 mL/kg predicted body weight. Computed tomography scan images and chest radiographs obtained before and following APRV showed lung parenchyma changes that may be related to ventilator-induced lung injury. We also present a mathematical model that is useful for simulating APRV and demonstrating the issues related to volume delivery for mandatory breaths during the transition between the 2 pressure levels. A key finding of this analysis is the interdependence of release volume, autoPEEP, and the T(low) time setting. Furthermore, it is virtually impossible to target a specific P(aCO(2)) with a desired level V(T) and autoPEEP in a passive model, emphasizing the importance of spontaneous breathing with this mode. This case report suggests caution when using these modes, and that end-inspiratory lung volumes and V(T) should be limited to avoid lung injury. The important point of this case study and model analysis is that the application of APRV is more complex than it appears to be.

Extant research has identified two distinct forms of death awareness: death anxiety and death reflection. Because researchers have exclusively examined death anxiety and death reflection as independent and unique variables across individuals while overlooking their interplay and co-existence within individuals, we know little about whether and why employees can have different combined experiences of two forms of death awareness over a certain period of time (e.g., during the pandemic), and how these different employee experiences relate to theoretically and practically important work-relevant consequences. To address this gap in our knowledge, we adopted a person-centered approach using latent profile analysis to consider death anxiety and death reflection conjointly within employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across two studies, we identified three distinct death awareness profiles-the disengaged, calm reflectors, and anxious reflectors-and found membership in these profiles systematically varied according to health- (e.g., risk of severe illness from COVID-19), work- (e.g., job-required human contact), and community-related (e.g., the number of regional infections) factors influencing the self-relevance of COVID-19 as a mortality cue. In addition, we found that these death awareness profiles differentially predicted important employee outcomes, including well-being (i.e., depression and emotional exhaustion) and prosocial behaviors at work (i.e., organizational citizenship behaviors and pro-diversity behavior).

Therefore, the use of more accessible neuroinflammatory biomarkers can be advantageous considering their diagnostic and prognostic potential for aggravated clinical outcomes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate neopterin and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL-10) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the diagnosis of neuroinvasive DENV and CHIKV. We analyzed the CSF of 66 patients with neurological disorders, comprising 12 neuroinvasive DENV/CHIKV, 20 inflammatory control (viral, bacterial, and fungal meningitis, and autoimmune disorders), and 24 noninflammatory control (cerebrovascular disease, dementia, neoplasm). There was no difference between the concentration of CSF neopterin in the neuroinvasive DENV/CHIKV and control groups. However, there was a significant difference in the CXCL-10 level when comparing the neuroinvasive DENV/CHIKV group and the non-inflammatory control (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we found a linear correlation between neopterin and CXCL-10 CSF levels in the three groups. For the DENV/CHIKV neuroinvasive diagnosis, the ROC curve showed the best cut-off values for CSF neopterin at 11.23 nmol/L (sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 63%), and for CSF CXCL-10 at 156.5 pg/mL (91.7% sensitivity and specificity).

First, they were more likely to experience housing eviction and, consequently, bear heavier transport burdens when moving. Second, they were more likely to face difficulties when returning to the cities, such as repeated quarantine and displacement, long-time drifting on the highway and transport-related job uncertainty. Although the long-term effects of these policies on migrants everyday activity-travel behaviour may be limited, their experiences during the early phase of Covid-19 had a significant impact on their Spring Festival homecoming the following year. Regionally targeted transport policies to prevent Covid-19 have fuelled ethnic discrimination by officially classifying people from some provinces as dangerous.

Microplastic spatial distributions are heavily influenced by anthropogenic factors, with higher concentrations reported in regions characterized by urban land cover, high population density, and wastewater treatment plant effluent. Spatial distributions may also be affected by physical watershed characteristics such as slope and elevation (positive and negative correlations with microplastic concentrations, respectively), although few studies address these factors.

At this point, life split into two fundamentally different cell types: the immortal germline representing an unbroken lineage of cell division with no intrinsic endpoint and the mortal soma, which ages and dies. In this review, we describe the germline as clock-free and the soma as clock-bound and discuss aging with respect to three DNA-based cellular clocks (telomeric, DNA methylation, and transposable element). The ticking of these clocks corresponds to the stepwise progressive limitation of growth and regeneration of somatic cells that we term somatic restriction. Somatic restriction acts in opposition to strategies that ensure continued germline replication and regeneration. We thus consider the plasticity of aging as a process not fixed to the pace of chronological time but one that can speed up or slow down depending on the rate of intrinsic cellular clocks. We further describe how germline factor reprogramming might be used to slow the rate of aging and potentially reverse it by causing the clocks to tick backward. Therefore, reprogramming may eventually lead to therapeutic strategies to treat degenerative diseases by altering aging itself, the one condition common to us all.","output":"No Time to Age: Uncoupling Aging from Chronological Time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glamping is an increasingly popular and accessible modern form of camping To address current and future impacts of COVID-19 on glamping, 2926 active leisure travelers in the US and Canada were surveyed Respondents were asked about post-COVID-19 glamping trip plans and hotel/resort trip plans for comparison Independent variables of interest include 2019 accommodation experiences, 2020 accommodation plans prior to COVID-19, and socio-demographics Results indicate more active leisure travelers have plans to take glamping trips (45 9%) after COVID-19 when permissible than hotel/resort trips (24 7%) The results highlight that the broad accessibility of glamping make it a viable leisure travel alternative during and after the pandemic","output":"Glamping after the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are the leading causes of death and disability in the U.

Six- or seven-day clinic attendance is required for months, regardless of distance, or childcare and other social responsibilities. Take home medications are not allowed unless rigid and formulaic conditions are met. Although addiction medicine has rejected the \\"criminal\\" paradigm in favor of OUD as a treatable medical disorder, methadone regulations have not kept pace with the science.Pregnancy is characterized by an ultra-rapid metabolic state, but regulations prevent the use of daily divided doses of methadone to maintain stability. This results in repeated episodes of maternal/fetal opioid withdrawal, as well as other fetal physiologic abnormalities. Interference with dose regimen adjustments prevents optimal outcomes.Further, methadone clinics are mostly urban, leaving patients in rural areas without access. This led to excessive morbidity and mortality when the opioid crisis hit. The response of merely expanding capacity in overcrowded urban clinics created a contagion menace when Covid-19 arrived. Pregnant women (and parents with children) were forced to negotiate dosing in dangerous conditions.A revised methadone system must provide treatment that is local, flexible, and limited in size to manage viral contagion risks.

Repurposing existing drugs offers the fastest opportunity to identify new indications for existing drugs as a stable solution against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is a critical target for designing potent antiviral agents against COVID-19. In this study, we identify potential inhibitors against COVID-19, using an amalgam of virtual screening, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding-free energy approaches from the Korea Chemical Bank drug repurposing (KCB-DR) database. The database screening of KCB-DR resulted in 149 binders. The dynamics of protein-drug complex formation for the seven top scoring drugs were investigated through MD simulations. Six drugs showed stable binding with active site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) indicated by steady RMSD of protein backbone atoms and potential energy profiles. Furthermore, binding free energy calculations suggested the community-acquired bacterial pneumonia drug ceftaroline fosamil and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor telaprevir are potent inhibitors against M(pro). Molecular dynamics and interaction analysis revealed that ceftaroline fosamil and telaprevir form hydrogen bonds with important active site residues such as Thr24, Thr25, His41, Thr45, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, and Glu166 that is supported by crystallographic information of known inhibitors. Telaprevir has potential side effects, but its derivatives have good pharmacokinetic properties and are suggested to bind M(pro).

The percentage of conidia germination, the number of colony forming units (CFU), vegetative growth and the number of produced conidia were evaluated. There was no effect of the different concentrations of the neutral detergent on the germination. All detergent concentrations affected negatively in the vegetative growth of the fungus. Only the detergent at 0.01% of concentration did not affect the CFU number and the conidia production of the fungus.

Knowing the role that environmental factors play in influenza virus outbreaks, environmental pollution and, in particular, atmospheric airborne (particulate matter, PM) has been considered as a potential key factor in the spread and mortality of COVID-19. A possible role of the PM as the virus carrier has also been debated. The role of PM in exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular disease has been well recognized. Accumulating evidence support the hypothesis that PM can trigger inflammatory response at molecular, cellular and organ levels. On this basis, we developed the hypothesis that PM may play a role as a booster of COVID-19 rather than as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2. To support our hypothesis, we analyzed the molecular signatures detected in cells exposed to PM samples collected in one of the most affected areas by the COVID-19 outbreak, in Italy. T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells were chosen to explore the global gene expression changes induced by the treatment with organic extracts of PM 2.5. The analysis of the KEGG's pathways showed modulation of several gene networks related to the leucocyte transendothelial migration, cytoskeleton and adhesion system. Three major biological process were identified, including coagulation, growth control and immune response. The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in the endothelial disease, coagulation disorders, diabetes and reproductive toxicity, supporting the hypothesis that PM, directly or through molecular interplay, affects the same molecular targets as so far known for SARS-COV-2, contributing to the cytokines storm and to the aggravation of the symptoms triggered by COVID-19. We provide evidence for a plausible cooperation of receptors and transmembrane proteins, targeted by PM and involved in COVID-19, together with new insights into the molecular interplay of chemicals and pathogens that could be of importance for sustaining public health policies and developing new therapeutic approaches.","output":"The Secretive Liaison of Particulate Matter and SARS-CoV-2.

It is of great importance to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the self-employed and their enterprises because they are seen as key drivers of economic growth and constitute an expanding group in many countries. Data were obtained from 845 self-employed workers by a web-based survey including questions about background information, work and family circumstances, well-being, sickness presenteeism, and questions about the pandemic. Results were that around 40% of the self-employed introduced new products, processes, and marketing methods, and just over 50% attempted to get new customers during the pandemic. Nearly half of the self-employed people reported that they lost contracts, and 22% judged the risk of bankruptcy to be quite or highly likely. Regression analyses showed that the more the self-employed reported impact on business indicators, increased work hours, a higher level of work-family conflict, and a lower level of mental well-being, the higher the risk of sickness presenteeism. The most common reasons given by the participants for sickness presenteeism during the pandemic were nobody else can carry out my responsibilities, I can't afford to take sick leave and I enjoy my work. Conclusions are that a critical event such as the pandemic probably adds to an already high workload for the self-employed. Impact on business operations such as developing new products/services and marketing, risk of bankruptcy and increased work hours seems to be important factors for explaining sickness presenteeism among the self-employed. Theoretical contributions from the study suggest that critical events such as the Covid-19 pandemic should be considered as an important environmental factor when studying sickness presenteeism among self-employed.","output":"Sickness Presenteeism Among the Swedish Self-Employed During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged at the end of 2019 and was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 Both the COVID-19 emergency and the extraordinary measures to contain it have negatively affected the life of billions of people and have threatened individuals and nations One of the main goals of clinical and health psychology during this pandemic is to investigate the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and psychobiological responses to the COVID-19 emergency as well as to the preventive measures that have been imposed by governments to limit the contagion, such as social isolation Psychological research has the responsibility to deliver sound empirical evidence to inform public health policies and to support and advise governments and policymakers in their introduction of sustainable, feasible, and cost-efficient prevention and intervention guidelines Hence, the goal of this call for research is to stimulate theoretical discussions and empirical investigations on the bio-psycho-social impacts of COVID-19 for individuals, groups, and nations We invite contributions that address the challenges that the COVID-19 emergency has imposed on couples, families, and social systems In addition, we call for studies that assess the specific effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on highly vulnerable populations such as children, adolescents, pregnant women, patients suffering from chronic and life-threatening conditions, healthcare workers, and elderly citizens Papers focusing on the impact of emotion regulation and coping strategies are encouraged Original research, data reports, study protocols, single case reports and community case studies, theoretical perspectives, and viewpoints are invited to help improve our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Psychological, Behavioral, and Interpersonal Effects and Clinical Implications for Health Systems of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Call for Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on motivational posturing theory (MPT) and procedural justice theory (PJT), this article makes recommendations for how best to secure compliance with social distancing regulations.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 25 separate national samples (matched to country population by age and sex) in 12 different countries were recruited through online panel providers (n=25 334). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Reported willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Reported willingness to receive a vaccine varied widely across samples, ranging from 63% to 88%. Multivariate logistic regression analyses reveal sex (female OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.64), trust in medical and scientific experts (OR=1.28, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.34) and worry about the COVID-19 virus (OR=1.47, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.53) as the strongest correlates of stated vaccine acceptance considering pooled data and the most consistent correlates across countries.

Traditionally, jails and prisons in the U.S. have not initiated or maintained MOUD for incarcerated individuals with OUD prior to their return to the community, which places them at high risk for fatal overdose. A 2018 law (Chapter 208) made Massachusetts (MA) the first state to mandate that five county jails deliver all FDA-approved MOUDs (naltrexone [NTX], buprenorphine [BUP], and methadone). Chapter 208 established a 4-year pilot program to expand access to all FDA-approved forms of MOUD at five jails, with two more MA jails voluntarily joining this initiative. The law stipulates that MOUD be continued for individuals receiving it prior to detention and be initiated prior to release among sentenced individuals where appropriate. The jails must also facilitate continuation of MOUD in the community on release. The Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN) partnered with these seven diverse jails, the MA Department of Public Health, and community treatment providers to conduct a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of Chapter 208. We will: (1) Perform a longitudinal treatment outcome study among incarcerated individuals with OUD who receive NTX, BUP, methadone, or no MOUD in jail to examine postrelease MOUD initiation, engagement, and retention, as well as fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose and recidivism; (2) Conduct an implementation study to understand systemic and contextual factors that facilitate and impede delivery of MOUDs in jail and community care coordination, and strategies that optimize MOUD delivery in jail and for coordinating care with community partners; (3) Calculate the cost to the correctional system of implementing MOUD in jail, and conduct an economic evaluation from state policy-maker and societal perspectives to compare the value of MOUD prior to release from jail to no MOUD among matched controls. MassJCOIN made significant progress during its first six months until the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. Participating jail sites restricted access for nonessential personnel, established other COVID-19 mitigation policies, and modified MOUD programming.

However, there has been no studies on examining SST among female sex workers. We aim to examine SST experience and its determinants among female sex workers in China. METHODS: A venue-based, cross-sectional study of female sex workers was conducted in eight Chinese cities in 2019. Participants completed a survey including socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and SST history. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the associated factors with SST. RESULTS: Among 1,287 Chinese female sex workers, 72.1% (928/1,287) had ever tested for syphilis, and 5.9% (76/1,287) had ever used syphilis self-testing. Among syphilis self-testers, more than half (57.9%, 44/76) reported that the self-test was their first syphilis test, around one-fifth (18.4%, 14/76) reported that syphilis self-testing results influenced the price of commercial sex. After adjusting for covariates, female sex workers who received anal sex in the past month (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.6, 95%CI: 1.5C4.3, p < 0.001), used drugs before or during sex (aOR: 3.8, 95%CI: 2.3C6.4, p < 0.001), tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the past 6 months (aOR: 3.4, 95%CI: 1.9C6.0), ever tested in the hospital (aOR: 5.1, 95%CI: 2.5C10.4, p < 0.001), and ever tested in the community (aOR: 1.7, 95%CI: 1.3C2.2, p < 0.001) were more likely to perform syphilis self-testing.

Using individual and georeferenced death data collected daily by the Cook County Medical Examiner, we provide first evidence that race does affect COVID-19 outcomes. The data confirm that in Cook County blacks are overrepresented in terms of COVID-19 related deaths since - as of June 16, 2020 - they constitute 35 percent of the dead, so that they are dying at a rate 1.3 times higher than their population share. Furthermore, by combining the spatial distribution of mortality with the 1930s redlining maps for the Chicago area, we obtain a block group level panel dataset of weekly deaths over the period January 1, 2020-June 16, 2020, over which we establish that, after the outbreak of the epidemic, historically lower-graded neighborhoods display a sharper increase in mortality, driven by blacks, while no pre-treatment differences are detected. Thus, we uncover a persistence influence of the racial segregation induced by the discriminatory lending practices of the 1930s, by way of a diminished resilience of the black population to the shock represented by the COVID-19 outbreak.

For cancer survivors, the first-year post-treatment is a critical time as many individuals transition back to their primary care provider and adjust to physical/psychosocial changes which occurred during their cancer treatment. In this longitudinal qualitative study, we followed a cohort of older adult cancer survivors through the first three waves of the pandemic to describe their experiences as a means for providing recommendations for how oncology nurses can tailor supports to this unique population. DATA SOURCES: We conducted individual, semi-structured qualitative interviews with 24 older adults at three time points during the pandemic. Data were analyzed drawing from interpretive descriptive methodologies. CONCLUSION: Older adult cancer survivors needs shifted during the pandemic from feeling confident and self-assured during the early days of COVID-19, to growing uncertainty and unease about their health and wellbeing. The main survivorship concerns included a preference for in-person appointments (as opposed to virtual), barriers to caregiver attendance at appointments, and diminished access to healthcare services.

Proteomics and reactive cysteine profiling link the antiviral activity of repurposed mucolytic agents to the reduction of key disulfides, specifically, by disruption of the Cys379-Cys432 and Cys391-Cys525 pairs distal to the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein. Computational analyses provide insight into conformation changes that occur when these disulfides break or form, consistent with an allosteric role, and indicate that P2119/P2165 target a conserved hydrophobic binding pocket in the RBD with the benzyl thiol warhead pointed directly towards Cys432.

In the obstetric setting, births cannot be postponed, and maternity staff had to adapt to assure obstetric safety while balancing evidence-based standards with the new challenges posed by the pandemic. This scoping review gives a comprehensive overview of the effecs the Covid-19 pandemic had on maternity staff. We followed the evidence-based approach described by Arksey & OMalley: we searched several databases for English and German articles published between January 2020 and January 2021 that discussed or touched upon the effects the pandemic had on maternity staff in OECD countries and China. We found that structural challenges caused by the crisis and its subjective effects on maternity staff fell into two main topic areas. Structural challenges (the first main topic) were divided into five subtopics: staff shortages and restructuring; personal protective equipment and tests; switching to virtual communication; handling women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection; and excluding accompanying persons. The pandemic also strongly affected the staffs mental health (the second main topic.) Attempting to meet challenges posed by the pandemic while afraid of contamination, suffering overwork and exhaustion, and struggling to resolve ethical-moral dilemmas had severe negative subjective effects. Several studies indicated increased depression, anxiety, stress levels, and risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms, although the crisis also generated strong occupational solidarity. Care for pregnant, birthing, and breast-feeding women cannot be interrupted, even during a pandemic crisis that requires social distancing. Maternity staff sometimes had to abandon normal standards of obstetric care and were confronted with enormous challenges and structural adjustments that did not leave them unscathed: their mental health suffered considerably.

METHOD This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent minimally invasive surgical or endoscopic CG and necrosectomy for clinically sterile WON between 2008 and 2013. Peri-procedural outcomes including costs were analyzed and compared. RESULTS Twenty patients underwent minimally invasive surgical (robotic = 14, laparoscopic = 6) CG and necrosectomy, and 20 patients underwent endoscopic treatment. The surgical cohort had a larger median cyst size and higher CCI score. For the surgical cohort, median OR time was 167.5 min, estimated blood loss was 30 ml, and 65% underwent concomitant cholecystectomy. There was no mortality in either group and no difference in complication rates (20%). The failure rate was similar (15 versus 10%, P = 0.66). Although surgery was associated with a lower re-intervention rate (0 versus 1, P = 0.008), the endotherapy group was associated with shorter total LOS (inclusive of re-interventions) (7 versus 3 days, P = 0.032). The cost of the index procedure was significantly higher for the surgery group (P = 0.014); however, when considering all readmissions and re-interventions until resolution of the WON, the total cost was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION Minimally invasive surgical and endoscopic CG and necrosectomy are comparable treatments for sterile WON in terms of outcomes and overall cost.

To reduce this risk, combined postoperative mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis has been routinely performed after HFS in these patients. This retrospective case-control study was conducted to evaluate the additional effectiveness of preoperative mechanical thromboprophylaxis for the prevention of VTE following HFS in elderly patients. METHODS Of 539 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older undergoing HFS, 404 (control group) did not receive preoperative mechanical thromboprophylaxis, while 135 (study group) received mechanical thromboprophylaxis using an intermittent pneumatic compression device and graduated compression stockings from the time of admission until surgery. All patients received combined postoperative mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis following HFS in accordance with the same protocol. The incidence of symptomatic VTE confirmed based on clinical symptoms and 3-dimensional CT angiography within one month of surgery was investigated in both groups. RESULTS The American Society of Anesthesiologists grade was higher (p = 0.016) in the study group and more patients in this group had concomitant cardiovascular and neurologic diseases (p = 0.005 and p = 0.009, respectively). In addition, more patients in the study group had received anticoagulant medication preinjury owing to comorbidities (39% vs 28%, p = 0.025). The overall incidences of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were 7.4% and 3.7%, and 2.2% and 1.5% in the control and study groups, respectively. According to multiple logistic regression, symptomatic DVT significantly reduced in the study group (OR 0.28, p = 0.042), while there was no significant difference in the incidence of symptomatic PE between the two groups (p = 0.223).

They are considered highly heterogeneous products due to the common degradation of amino acids that occurs during their production in upstream and downstream processes (e.g., oxidation and deamidation) and, above all, their complex glycosylation profile. Multi-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (mD-LC-MS) has recently gained much interest for process analytical technology, enabling the integration of this analytical technology in production and purification environments. In this study, an online mD-LC-MS/MS peptide mapping method was developed for monitoring multiple quality attributes, including the N-glycosylation state of a complex Fc-fusion protein, which is made by combining two heavily glycosylated cytokines with an Fc domain. This fully automated workflow includes sample purification, reduction, digestion, peptide mapping, and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. Two immobilized enzyme cartridges based on trypsin and Lys-C protease were employed to generate a detailed glycosylation mapping, as trypsin allowed the identification of only one of four glycosylation sites, while Lys-C was more informative for two other sites. Site-specific glycosylation information such as antennarity, sialyation, and core fucosylation state was also determined. In addition to glycans, other post-translational modifications could be monitored simultaneously during the cell culture production processes by the mD-LC-MS/MS approach. In summary, the generated data demonstrate the applicability of mD-LC-MS for the monitoring and trending of multiple attributes for complex antibody formats over production processes in an automated and fast manner, compared to the complex and time-consuming traditional offline assays.","output":"Monitoring multiple quality attributes of a complex Fc-fusion protein during cell culture production processes by mD-LC-MS peptide mapping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tree hole refers to a social media formed after the death of a social media user, in which other users continue to leave messages due to emotional resonance. This paper focuses on exploring the fluctuation of emotions with time in a tree hole of social media such as Microblog, and provides ideas and support for suicide warning, rescue, and user portraits of patients with depression in the tree hole. In this paper, the dataset of 2,356,066 messages captured from the tree hole Microblog with the tree hole agent (i.e., an AI program) and pre-processed. Subsequently, the effective dataset was labeled by a text sentiment analysis model based on BERT and BiLSTM, and accordingly the sentiment was scored. Then the scored data was visualized and analyzed in the time dimension. Finally, it was found that the sentiment of the tree hole messages reached a trough at 4:00 am and a peak around 8:00 am. In addition, the overall trend of tree hole sentiment has fluctuated downwards from Monday to Sunday. We have concluded that the sentiment of patients with depression fluctuates regularly at some special time points, and special events such as the outbreak of COVID-19 and so on, have a great impact on the emotions of patients with depression. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen warning and intervention for those who has expressed thoughts of suicide at special points to prevent the spread and fermentation of suicidal emotions in the tree hole in time.

The introduction of specialist asthma services across the UK has attempted to improve quality of care and ensure that patients undergo a full systematic assessment prior to initiation of advanced biological therapies. However, improvements are required in the patient pathway to minimise avoidable harm. OBJECTIVES: To define standards of care in areas where the evidence base is lacking through patient and healthcare professional (HCP) consensus. METHODS: The precision UK National Working Group of asthma experts identified 42 statements formed from 7 key themes. An online four-point Likert scale questionnaire was sent to HCPs working in asthma throughout the UK to assess agreement (consensus) with these statements; a subset of the statements formed a patient questionnaire. Consensus was defined as high if 75% and very high if 90% of respondents agreed with a statement. RESULTS: A total of 117/197 responses (59.3% response rate) were received from severe asthma patients (n=15) and HCPs (n=102) including respiratory physicians, respiratory nurse specialists, respiratory pharmacists, specialist physiotherapists and general practitioners. Consensus was very high in 25 (60%) statements, high in 12 (29%) statements and was not achieved in 5 (12%) statements.

Although there have been many studies about the association between Bwt variability and various health status, its association with the incidence of dementia among elderly people has not been examined. Methods: We performed a retrospective elderly cohort study from 19,987 participants with mean age 73 years old in the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We examined the risk of incident dementia, including Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia, according to the quartile of Bwt variability, represented as coefficient of variation (Bwt-CV), SD (Bwt-SD), and variability independent of the mean (Bwt-VIM). Results: In fully adjusted model, the group with the highest Bwt variability (Bwt-VIM Q4) showed an increased risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.206-1.603) and Alzheimer's dementia (HR 1.46, CI 1.240-1.724) compared to the lowest quartile (Bwt-VIM Q1). We also found that subjects with the highest Bwt variability (Q4) and underweight BMI had a significantly increased risk of developing dementia (HR 1.994, 95% CI 1.302-3.054), while subjects with low Bwt variability (Q1 and Q2) and obese BMI had decreased risk of dementia (HR 0.664, 95% CI 0.505-0.872 and HR 0.648, 95% CI 0.493-0.852, respectively) compared to reference group (lowest Bwt variability (Q1) with normal baseline BMI).

We conclude by proposing a simple framework for the analysis of the interplay between perceived global change-induced tipping points, global networks, and international institutions.","output":"Global networks and global change-induced tipping points"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus that requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for replication of its viral genome. Nucleoside analogs such as Remdesivir and -d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine are antiviral candidates and may function as chain terminators or induce viral mutations, thus impairing RdRp function. Recently disclosed Cryo-EM structures of apo, RNA-bound, and inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV-2 RdRp provided insight into the inhibitor-bound structure by capturing the enzyme with its reaction product: Remdesivir covalently bound to the RNA primer strand. To gain a structural understanding of the binding of this and several other nucleoside analogs in the precatalytic state, molecular models were developed that predict the noncovalent interactions to a complex of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, RNA, and catalytic metal cations. MM-GBSA evaluation of these interactions is consistent with resistance-conferring mutations and existing structureCactivity relationship (SAR) data. Therefore, this approach may yield insights into antiviral mechanisms and guide the development of experimental drugs for COVID-19 treatment.","output":"Biostructural Models for the Binding of Nucleoside Analogs to SARS-CoV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delirium is an acute change in attention and cognition occurring in ~ 65% of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases. It is also common following surgery and an indicator of brain vulnerability and risk for the development of dementia. In this work we analyzed the underlying role of metabolism in delirium-susceptibility in the postoperative setting using metabolomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid and blood taken from the same patients prior to planned orthopaedic surgery. Distance correlation analysis and Random Forest (RF) feature selection were used to determine changes in metabolic networks. We found significant concentration differences in several amino acids, acylcarnitines and polyamines linking delirium-prone patients to known factors in Alzheimer's disease such as monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) protein. Subsequent computational structural comparison between MAOB and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as well as protein-protein docking analysis showed that there potentially is strong binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to MAOB. The possibility that SARS-CoV-2 influences MAOB activity leading to the observed neurological and platelet-based complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires further investigation.","output":"Metabolomics and computational analysis of the role of monoamine oxidase activity in delirium and SARS-COV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although people often disapprove of conformity, they also dislike when others deviate from group norms.

Four studies (N = 808), using both hypothetical and real-life instances of conformity, support this prediction. We find that people judge those who conform to gain social approval (self-interested conformity) as weak-willed, but those who conform out of concern for their group (benevolent conformity) as competent and possessing strong character. In addition, we predict and find that people view self-interested conformity as \\"fake\\" but benevolent conformity as revealing one's true self. Finally, we show that differences in perceived intentions explain how people sustain positive self-regard while succumbing to group pressures and why people judge their own conformity more favorably than others' conformity.

Anxiety, depression, burn out and the high proportion of post-traumatic stress disorder proved to be the most expected troubles caused by this pandemic and the confinement. Medico-psychological emergency units (CUMP) have been solicited at the very early stage of the pandemic because CUMP units are very well known by the French government and systematically associated to emergency plans. METHODS: In this article we describe the process which has been developed to cope with the psychological needs in the general population. At a first level, platforms of volunteers specialised into listening were available. Then those platforms could directly mobilise the CUMP in case of psychiatric disorders. It ran over the whole first wave and it has been reactivated because of the second confinement in France. RESULTS: During the first wave, approximately 1% of all the calls made on the national Covid number required to be redirected to the listening platforms. Of this group, 4% were related to reactive pathology or a psychiatric decompensating that required adapted and specialised care. CONCLUSION: The high rates of psychological distress detected in the general population in recent scientific literature seem discrepant with our findings of relatively low reorientation towards the CUMP. Nevertheless, our study highlights that the response of the CUMP network in France during the first wave was supportive. The second wave displays its adaptability to the public health policies.","output":"An appropriate and reactive response to the repeated waves of the COVID-19 pandemic by the national medico-psychological network (CUMP) in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: sarcopenia and frailty are associated with increased risk of falls and fractures. This study evaluated the feasibility of assessing sarcopenia and frailty among older people attending fracture clinics. METHODS: patients aged 65+ years with an arm fracture attending fracture clinics in one UK city were recruited. Sarcopenia was assessed using gait speed, grip strength, skeletal muscle mass index SMI, SARC-F questionnaire and the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) I and II criteria. Frailty was assessed using Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP), FRAIL scale, PRISMA-7, electronic Frailty Index (e-FI), Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) and Study of Osteoporotic Fracture. The sensitivity and specificity of each tool was calculated against the EWGSOP II criteria (sarcopenia) and FFP (frailty). Patients identified to have either condition were referred for Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). Interviews with 13 patients and nine staff explored the acceptability of this process. RESULTS: hundred patients (Mean age 75 years) were recruited. Most sarcopenia and frailty assessments were quick with complete data collection and were acceptable to patients and staff. Sarcopenia was identified among 4C39% participants depending on the tool and frailty among 9C25%. Both conditions were more common among men than women with all tools. The SARC-F and PRISMA-7 had the best sensitivity (100 and 93%, respectively) and specificity (96 and 87%). CGA among 80% of referred participants led to three interventions per participant (e.g. medication changes and investigations).

Using this platform, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as low as 9  10-14 M are achieved as a result of up to 10,000-fold potency enhancements compared to corresponding IgGs. Combination of three different antibody specificities and the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain on a single multivalent molecule conferred the ability to overcome viral sequence variability together with outstanding potency and IgG-like bioavailability. The MULTi-specific, multi-Affinity antiBODY (Multabody or MB) platform thus uniquely leverages binding avidity together with multi-specificity to deliver ultrapotent and broad neutralizers against SARS-CoV-2.

The spike protein exists in two structurally distinct conformations, prefusion and postfusion. The transition from prefusion to postfusion conformation of the spike protein must be triggered, leading to membrane fusion. This article reviews current knowledge about the structures and functions of coronavirus spike proteins, illustrating how the two S1 domains recognize different receptors and how the spike proteins are regulated to undergo conformational transitions.

Models for count data are needed when the variable of interest take only non-negative integer values and these integers arise from counting occurrences. Several R-packages are currently available to deal with spatiotemporal areal count data. Each package focuses on different models and/or statistical methodologies. Unfortunately, the results generated by these models are rarely comparable due to differences in notation and methods. The main objective of this paper is to present a review describing the most important approaches that can be used to model and analyse count data when questions of scientific interest concern both their spatial and their temporal behaviour and we monitor their performance under the same data set. For this review, we focus on the three R-packages that can be used for this purpose and the different models assessed are representative of the two most widespread methodologies used to analyse spatiotemporal count data: the classical approach (based on Penalised Likelihood or Estimating Equations) and the Bayesian point of view. A case study is analysed as an illustration of these different methodologies. In this case study, these packages are used to model and predict daily hospitalisations from COVID-19 in 24 health regions within the Valencian Community (Spain), with data corresponding to the period from 28 June to 13 December 2020.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on an extended literature review on CSR, CI, CR and CL studies, the authors evaluate the impact of these four constructs on SMEs' performance in an emerging market. The paper follows a quantitative approach. The study sample was composed of 482 responses covering top executives, managers and experts. The Smart PLS SEM version 3.3.2 was used to analyse the data of the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) of Vietnam in the year 2020C2021. Findings: The authors' findings reveal significant and positive relationships amongst CSR, FP, CSR and CI, CSR and CR, CSR and CL, and most importantly, the findings add value to the current knowledge by exploring the mediating effect of CI, CR and CL between CSR and FP. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted in Vietnam. As a result, the findings of the study might not be applicable for other countries, if the economic and environmental settings are different from that of Vietnam. Therefore, future research should consider for other countries, other regions. Second, due to the purpose and priority of the study, CI, CR, and CL was employed as mediators amongst the relationship between CSR and FP. Thus, future research should consider other mediators or moderators in such a relationship to see how CSR generates outcomes in the new associations. Practical implications: The study regarding the role of CSR in enhancing the performance of SMEs can motivate firm's chief executive officers (CEOs) to be proactive in getting involved and practising CSR in a consistent manner. Second, the above discussion draws a very important implication for the executive level, the management level of the enterprise, which enterprises should balance the interests of business, customers, other stakeholders, the environment and society in order to optimise CSR outcomes for improving competitiveness and developing sustainably. This implication is particularly important to the survival and development of SMEs in a challenging emerging economy. Social implications: The study widens the literature regarding relationship between CSR and SMEs' performance. Besides, the study supports stakeholder theory that explains why CSR positively affects firm's performance. The significant mediating roles of CI, CR and CL were positively confirmed in the study. Although previous studies determined that such roles are strategic source of competitive advantages of enterprises, however, how CSR involved in enhancing the roles has not been deeply explored and integrated. Third, the findings of the study support the resource-based view (RBV) and resource-based perspective that explains why firm should engage in CSR activities, and CI, CR and CL can enhance firm's performance by providing strategic source of competitive advantages that facilitate business to improve its performance in sustainable direction. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current literature on CSR and FP shows that, to date, there has been little empirical research on the mediating mechanism of CI, CR and CL in the link between CSR and FP for SMEs. The findings of the study may have great implications for entrepreneurs and top management with respect to the strategic perspectives to drive the businesses and to improve firm's performance in a sustainable direction in the context of emerging markets. In addition, the finding might be of great interest to C and motivate C SMEs' managers to engage with CSR actions where such businesses were or are situated during and after the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. By that understanding, the Government might allow for innovative and groundbreaking policies or the reformation of old policies to leverage busin sses to promote their strengths towards sustainable development in the new economic settings.

We reported the case of a 6-year-old child presented with acute abdomen and then diagnosed with MIS-C. In addition, to better portray this new entity, we performed a systematic review of MIS-C gastrointestinal features and particularly on those mimicking surgical emergencies. Methods: We described the clinical presentation, the diagnostic approach and the therapeutic outcomes of our MIS-C patient. Parallel to this, we conducted a systematic literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, focusing on gastrointestinal MIS-C. Results: Our patient was initially assessed by the surgical team due to his query acute abdomen. Following the diagnosis of MIS-C with myocarditis, intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/Kg/day) and intravenous immunoglobulins (2 gr/Kg single infusion) were promptly started, leading to clinical improvement.

Interestingly, no biological factors have been studied to explain this disparity in such contexts. Sex hormone variations induced by hormonal contraceptives (HC) have been associated with mental health vulnerabilities. However, most studies have examined current effects of HC without considering whether a chronic modulation of sex hormone levels could induce long-lasting effects that persist after HC cessation. OBJECTIVES: To date, the role of HC on psychological health in women during a disease outbreak is still unknown. We aimed to investigate both current and long-term effects of HC on psychological distress throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: At four time points during the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020, September 2020, December 2020, March 2021), we collected self-reported data on psychological distress, assessing symptoms of post-traumatic stress [via the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R)], symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress [via the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21)]. Linear mixed models were first used to compare men (n = 49), naturally cycling women (n = 73), and women using HC (n = 32) across time. To examine long-lasting effects of HC, exploratory analyses were restricted to women, comparing current HC users (n = 32), past users (n = 56), and never users (n = 17). RESULTS: The first model revealed that women taking HC reported stable post-traumatic stress symptoms across time, compared to naturally cycling women and men who showed a significant decrease from T1 to T2. HC users also reported greater DASS-21 total scores over time. Moreover, HC users reported higher stress and anxiety symptoms than men. In the second model, results showed that past HC users had similar anxiety levels as current HC users. These two groups reported significantly more anxiety symptoms than never users. CONCLUSION: HC users report increased distress during the pandemic relative to naturally cycling women and men. Our results also suggest a long-lasting effect of HC intake, highlighting the importance of considering both the current use of HC and its history. This could provide some insight into potential avenues for explaining why some women are prone to higher psychological distress than men.","output":"A Year Through the COVID-19 Pandemic: Deleterious Impact of Hormonal Contraception on Psychological Distress in Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the second installment of a series of interviews, conducted by the senior author (S.D.W.) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS), that feature international leaders in surgery telling of the challenges they faced during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Among the extensive efforts to improve the performance and usability of PADs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) based sensing mechanisms have shown great promise, because of their high sensitivity and label-free operations. However, the method to improve EIS biosensing on PADs is less explored. Here, we present an experimental approach to enhancing the biosensing performance of paper-based EIS nanobiosensors with working electrodes (WEs) decorated with vertically grown zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs). Through a comparison among different EIS settings and an examination of ZnO-WE effects on EIS measurements, we show that Faradaic processes with Fe-based electron mediators are more reliable for ZnO-NW-enhanced working electrodes. We calibrate sensors featuring varied morphologies of ZnO NWs and achieve a low limit of detection (0.4 pg ml(?1)) for detecting p24 antigen as a marker for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Through theoretical analysis, imaging, and electrochemical characterizations, we reveal that the total surface area and electrochemical surface area indicate the sensitivity and sensing range of the EIS nanobiosensors.

Isolates of S. flexneri 4c, 4a, and x made up 3% respectively of the total isolates. Significant decreases in percentage of S. flexneri over time were observed. S. sonnei surpassed S. flexneri 2a as the predominant serotype in 2000. Most isolates were recovered from July to September; 13.6% of the isolates were recovered from children aged 0 to 5 years, and 16% were recovered from those aged 21 to 25 years. S. flexneri 2a and 5 were recovered mostly from males (33.41%, p < 0.001; and 0.46%, p < 0.001%; respectively), whereas S. flexneri 2b and 6, and S. sonnei were most often isolated from females. Continuous monitoring of Shigella showed that all 4 species and 27 serotypes were present in Beijing, China, during the study period. The emergence of S. sonnei and the overall decreasing isolation rate of Shigella in Beijing can potentially aid in the development of vaccine and control strategies for shigellosis in the city.","output":"Changing trends and serotype distribution of Shigella species in Beijing from 1994 to 2010"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 5443 Da peptide with sequence homology to defensins was purified from purple pole beans (Phaseolus vulgaris cv.

The peptide inhibited mycelial growth in Mycosphaerella arachidicola, Helminthosporium maydis, Fusarium oxysporum, Verticillium dahliae, Rhizoctonia solani, Candida albicans and Setosphaeria turcica with an IC50 of 0.8, 0.9, 2.3, 3.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 9.8 microM respectively. Its antifungal potency was higher than that of the plant defensin coccinin (IC50>50 microM). It induced membrane permeabilization in C. albicans as evidenced by SYTOX Green uptake, but did not affect erythrocyte membrane permeability. It inhibited growth in M. arachidicola by inducing chitin accumulation at hyphal tips as was shown by Congo Red staining. The antifungal activity was pH stable and thermostable. The peptide inhibited the proliferation of hepatoma (HepG2), breast cancer (MCF7), colon cancer (HT29) and cervical cancer (SiHa) cells but not that of human embryonic liver (WRL68) cells.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify and describe the prevalence of food insecurity at a public university before and after the onset of Covid-19 as well as factors associated with any change in food security. Researchers administered a cross-sectional, non-probability survey to college students (n = 3206) that assessed food security status prior to and after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as questions related to various sociodemographic characteristics. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Thirty-eight percent of students experienced a change in food security as a result of the pandemic, with 59.6% becoming less food secure, and 40.4% becoming more food secure. Characteristics that were associated with changes in food security included changes in housing and employment status as a result of the pandemic. These findings suggest that the pandemic led to changes in food security among college students, and that economic relief efforts should include college students, who are disproportionately affected by food insecurity.","output":"Covid-19 and College Students: Food Security Status before and after the Onset of a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose : Minimizing healthcare-related exposures for patients and providers are paramount during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We performed a retrospective cohort study to compare visual outcomes and patient satisfaction in senior residentperformed immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS) versus delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). Methods : All ISBCS and DSBCS patients who underwent senior resident-performed cataract surgery in the Comprehensive Ophthalmology division of a single academic institution from May to September 2020 were included. Outcome measures were final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), final manifest refraction (MRx), incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications, total number of clinical and surgical visits, and patient satisfaction, assessed postoperatively by telephone questionnaire. Results : Fourteen (22 eyes) and 28 (56 eyes) patients underwent senior residentperformed ISBCS and DSBCS, respectively. Final CDVA was 20/25 or better in 21 (95%) ISBCS eyes and 51 (91%) DSBCS eyes (p=0.670). The deviation of final MRx from target refraction was within 0.50 D in 17 (77%) ISBCS eyes and 47 (84%) DSBCS eyes (p=0.522). There was no significant difference in intraoperative (p=1.000) or postoperative (p=1.000) complications. ISBCS patients averaged 3.5 fewer visits than DSBCS patients (5.9 vs 9.5, p<0.001). All ISBCS and 20 DSBCS patients (87%) reported they were overall very satisfied or satisfied with their experience (p=0.701), and there was no significant difference in the overall visual function 7 score, where 0 indicates the worst possible functional impairment and 100 indicates no disability (p=0.561). Finally, five of the six senior residents who performed the ISBCS cases included in this study reported that they preferred performing ISBCS over DSBCS. Conclusions : This early experience demonstrates that senior resident-performed ISBCS is as safe and effective as DSBCS, with the added benefit of averaging fewer in-person visits for patients.

Methods and Results Male C57BL/6J mice (4-6 months of age) were subjected to sham surgeries or transverse aortic constriction to produce cardiac pressure overload. Two weeks after transverse aortic constriction, empagliflozin (10 mg/kg per day) or vehicle was administered daily for 4 weeks. Empagliflozin increased survival rate and significantly attenuated adverse left ventricle remodeling and cardiac fibrosis after transverse aortic constriction. Empagliflozin also attenuated left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, evaluated by echocardiography, and increased exercise endurance by 36% in mice with transverse aortic constriction-induced heart failure. Empagliflozin significantly increased glucose and fatty acid oxidation in failing hearts, while reducing glycolysis. These beneficial cardiac effects of empagliflozin occurred despite no significant changes in fasting blood glucose, body weight, or daily urine volume. In vitro experiments in isolated cardiomyocytes indicated that empagliflozin had direct effects to improve cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium transients. Importantly, molecular docking analysis and isolated perfused heart experiments indicated that empagliflozin can bind cardiac glucose transporters to reduce glycolysis, restore activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and inhibit activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that empagliflozin may directly bind glucose transporters to reduce glycolysis, rebalance coupling between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and regulate the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway to attenuate adverse cardiac remodeling and progression of heart failure induced by pressure-overload in non-diabetic mellitus mice.","output":"Direct Cardiac Actions of the Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin Improve Myocardial Oxidative Phosphorylation and Attenuate Pressure-Overload Heart Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe pulmonary infection, with a??35 % mortality.

We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the scientific production of non-COVID-19 research. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive meta-research on studies (original articles, research letters and case reports) published between 01/01/2019 and 01/01/2021 in 10 high-impact medical and infectious disease journals (New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association, Nature Medicine, British Medical Journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, Lancet Global Health, Lancet Public Health, Lancet Infectious Disease and Clinical Infectious Disease). For each publication, we recorded publication date, publication type, number of authors, whether the publication was related to COVID-19, whether the publication was based on a case series, and the number of patients included in the study if the publication was based on a case report or a case series. We estimated the publication dynamics with a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing method. A Natural Language Processing algorithm was designed to calculate the number of authors for each publication. We simulated the number of non-COVID-19 studies that could have been published during the pandemic by extrapolating the publication dynamics of 2019 to 2020, and comparing the expected number to the observed number of studies. RESULTS: Among the 22,525 studies assessed, 6319 met the inclusion criteria, of which 1022 (16.2%) were related to COVID-19 research. A dramatic increase in the number of publications in general journals was observed from February to April 2020 from a weekly median number of publications of 4.0 (IQR: 2.8C5.5) to 19.5 (IQR: 15.8C24.8) (p < 0.001), followed afterwards by a pattern of stability with a weekly median number of publications of 10.0 (IQR: 6.0C14.0) until December 2020 (p = 0.045 in comparison with April). Two prototypical editorial strategies were found: 1) journals that maintained the volume of non-COVID-19 publications while integrating COVID-19 research and thus increased their overall scientific production, and 2) journals that decreased the volume of non-COVID-19 publications while integrating COVID-19 publications. We estimated using simulation models that the COVID pandemic was associated with a 18% decrease in the production of non-COVID-19 research. We also found a significant change of the publication type in COVID-19 research as compared with non-COVID-19 research illustrated by a decrease in the number of original articles, (47.9% in COVID-19 publications vs 71.3% in non-COVID-19 publications, p < 0.001). Last, COVID-19 publications showed a higher number of authors, especially for case reports with a median of 9.0 authors (IQR: 6.0C13.0) in COVID-19 publications, compared to a median of 4.0 authors (IQR: 3.0C6.0) in non-COVID-19 publications (p < 0.001).

By determining whether certain pre-existing conditions predispose patients to developing gait instability, we will be able to better counsel patients regarding risk of MRgFUS thalamotomy. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with essential tremor, mixed tremor syndrome, or tremor predominant Parkinson disease who underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy at Mayo Clinic, Rochester between 2017 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographic and clinical data was extracted, and gait symptoms were compared pre- versus post-operatively. RESULTS: Of 45 patients who underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy, 42 had at least one follow-up visit within twelve months and were included in the study. 39 patients had essential tremor, 1 had tremor predominant Parkinson disease, and 2 had mixed tremor syndrome. 19 out of 42 patients (45%) had gait decline. There were 10 (24%) females, and median age was 77.6 years (IQR 71.5C83.2). Older age was not correlated with gait decline (p = 0.82). Patients with a history of neuropathy and joint replacements were more likely to have gait decline after MRgFUS thalamotomy (p = 0.0099 and p = 0.0376). Patients with pre-existing gait aids were not more likely to have gait instability (p = 0.20). CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo MRgFUS thalamotomy for each of the tremor conditions, have an increased risk of experiencing gait decline, when there is a pre-procedure history of peripheral neuropathy, or joint replacement surgery.

In this study we sought to evaluate the clinical utility of scintigraphy in the diagnosis and management of patients with NE tumors at a major university hospital. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent both (111)indium-pentetreotide scintigraphy and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) at a single institution between February 2001 and July 2008. Charts were reviewed for patient demographics, symptoms of NE disease, and results of biochemical testing, imaging studies, histopathologic diagnosis, and medical and/or surgical management. RESULTS One hundred forty-five patients received (111)indium-pentetreotide scintigraphy (SRS) and concurrent cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) over the 7-year period studied. In the evaluation of primary disease, 60 % of tumors were localized by anatomic imaging, significantly greater than the 15 % detection rate achieved by SRS. In the evaluation of recurrent disease, 61 % of NE tumors were localized by cross-sectional imaging, significantly greater than the 31 % detection rate of SRS. Scintigraphy identified disease foci not seen on CT/MRI in just 8 of 74 of the cohort with evidence of disease and only altered the surgical management in 3 of 74 cases. CONCLUSIONS Cross-sectional CT/MRI imaging is sufficient for the localization of NE tumors.

While existing studies and theories suggest that factors such as gratitude, social support, and hope play a role in the risk of depression, few studies have combined these factors to explore the relationship between them. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the mediating roles of social support and hope in the relationship between gratitude and depression among front-line medical staff during the pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: This study used the Gratitude Questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), the State Hope Scale (SHS), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to examine the gratitude, social support, hope, and depression among 344 front-line medical workers in Wuhan, which was the hardest-hit area of COVID-19 in China. RESULTS: The results showed that the prevalence of mild depressive disorder was 40.12% and the prevalence of major depressive disorder was 9.59% among front-line medical staff during the pandemic of COVID-19; gratitude has a direct and negative effect on depression. Gratitude was negative predictors of depression through the mediating variables of social support and hope [(gratitude)(C)(social support)(C)(depression) = ?0.096, 95%CI(?0.129 to ?0.064); (gratitude)(C)(hope)(C)(depression) = ?0.034, 95%CI(?0.055 to ?0.013)], as well as via an indirect path from social support to hope [(gratitude)(C)(social support)(C)(hope)(C)(depression) = ?0.089, 95%CI (?0.108 to ?0.070)].

The aim of this study was to explore smoking behaviour changes and associations with perceived changes in stress levels and sleep duration among Israeli hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted (May-June, 2020) among employees of a large tertiary medical centre. Data collected included socio-demographic characteristics, smoking status, perceptions of risk for COVID-19 infection and disease severity, presence of a chronic illness, COVID-19 exposure and infection status, involvement in treating COVID-19 patients, changes in stress levels, sleep duration, and in smoking behaviour during the pandemic. Multi-nominal logistic regression modelling assessed the effect of covariates on smoking behaviour changes. RESULTS: More than half (59%) of the 920 respondents, reported an increase in stress levels, and 28% reported changes in sleep duration. One-third (35%) of current smokers (n = 132) reported smoking more during COVID-19. Increased smoking was associated with increased stress (OR = 3.45; 95% CI 1.2-9.4). In addition, a significant association was demonstrated between an increase in sleeping hours and a decrease in smoking (OR = 6.62, 95% CI 1.2-32). The negative association between changes in smoking and sleep duration was strongest among smokers who reported perceived levels of stress to be the same or slightly higher than pre-COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically for health workers, include negative changes in smoking behaviours and sleep patterns. Mental health support for health workers should address smoking behaviours alongside stress-management skills and coping strategies. Lessons learned from the current pandemic should guide us as the world prepares for a future health crisis. KEY MESSAGES: Increased stress was linked with increased smoking among Israeli hospital workers during COVID-19. Mental health support should target smoking together with offering stress-management skills.","output":"Changes in smoking, stress, and sleep duration among Israeli hospital workers during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There are significant gaps in our understanding of the mortality effects of COVID-19 due to evolving diagnosis criteria, shortages of testing supplies, and challenges faced by physicians in treating patients in crisis environments. Accurate information on the number of deaths caused by COVID-19, both population wide and for demographic subgroups, is vital for policy makers and health care providers. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of weekly data for Ohio, a large American state. To estimate expected mortality in 2020 we employed data from 2010 through 2019, adjusted for secular trends and seasonality. We estimated excess mortality as the number of observed deaths less the number of expected deaths. We conducted the analysis for the entire population and by gender, race, age, and county of residence. Findings: We estimated 1,485 (95% CI 680-2,345) excess all-cause deaths in Ohio from March 15, 2020 through May 23, 2020. When limited to deaths due to natural causes, the estimated excess number of deaths increased to 2,504 (95% CI 1,633-3,221), reflecting the countervailing effect of a decrease in deaths due to external causes. While the largest number excess of deaths was observed in the 80+ age group, excess deaths comprised 45.3% (95% CI 21.8-60.9) of observed deaths in the groups corresponding to ages between 20 and 49 years old. Our estimate of 729 (95% CI 355-966) excess deaths for this group substantially exceeds the reported number of COVID-19 deaths of 51. We found elevated excess deaths for older individuals, blacks, and males. Interpretation: Our methodology addressed some of the challenges of estimating the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. Our finding of high proportional levels of excess deaths among younger age groups suggests that increases in the infection rates for this cohort may have a greater mortality impact than expected.

We studied the physiological effects of N95 FFR use in a cohort of gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopies. METHODS Data collection and comparisons included (1) symptoms and change in vital signs in 12 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy for 60 minutes while wearing a surgical mask (SM) and face-shield (FS); N95 FFR, SM and FS; and powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), and (2) respiratory belt plethysmography and continuous EKG frequency-based heart rate variability indices including very low frequency power (measures intracardiac sympathetic tone) and low frequency to high frequency ratios (intracardiac sympathetic to vagal ratio) in 11 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy while wearing a SM (15 minutes), N95 FFR and SM (60 minutes), and SM (15 minutes) in rapid sequence. RESULTS Ten of 12 (83%) gastroenterologists reported symptoms with N95 FFR use, most commonly breathing difficulty, frustration, fatigue, and headache. Nine (75%) of these gastroenterologists had associated significant heart rate elevation. Respiratory peak to trough measurement showed a significant increase (F(2)=7.543, p=0.004) during the N95 FFR stage, which resolved after removal of N95 FFR. Although not statistically different, all gastroenterologists showed a decrease in sympathetic to vagal ratio and an increase in intracardiac sympathetic effect in the N95 FFR stage. PAPR use was better tolerated but associated with headache and elevated heart rate in 4 (33%) gastroenterologists.

However chaos theory and human uncertainty/ignorance guarantee that shocks, breakdowns and catastrophes like COVID-19 will increasingly occur due to converging environmental resource crises. The challenge then is designing a resilient (safe-fail) economy that can endure, adapt to and successfully recover from breakdowns and avoid collapse. To date little attention has been paid in ecological economics to the implications of resilience for broader economic decisions affecting the design of global civilization. This paper provides a general introduction to resilience and an argument for why it should become a much larger focus of ecological economic research going forward. Five arguments are advanced for why resilience should not be subsumed under an existing goal, including that efforts to build resilience have the potential to both complement and contradict the other three goals, especially efficiency. The Resilience Alliances adaptive cycle highlighting the cost to resilience of increasing scale and complexity meshes readily with ecological economist's own critiques of growth, encouraging increased collaboration between these transdisciplines. The need to further study these tensions provides justification for adding Resilient Design as a distinct fourth policy goal to core ecological economic theory.","output":"Living to Spend Another Day: Exploring Resilience as a New Fourth Goal of Ecological Economics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyper-inflammation associated with cytokine storm syndrome causes high mortality in patients with COVID-19. Glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS), effectively inhibit this inflammatory response. However, frequent and chronic administration of glucocorticoids at high doses leads to hormone dependence and serious side effects. The aim of the present study was to combine nanoparticles with erythrocytes for the targeted delivery of MPSS to the lungs. Chitosan nanoparticles loading MPSS (MPSS-CSNPs) were prepared and adsorbed on the surface of red blood cells (RBC-MPSS-CSNPs) by non-covalent interaction. In vivo pharmacokinetic study indicated that RBC-hitchhiking could significantly reduce the plasma concentration of the drug and prolong the circulation time. The mean residence time (MRT) and area under the curve (AUC) of the RBC-MPSS-CSNPs group were significantly higher than those of the MPSS-CSNPs group and the MPSS injection group. Moreover, in vivo imaging and tissue distribution indicated that RBC-hitchhiking facilitated the accumulation of nanoparticles loading fluorescein in the lung, preventing uptake of these nanoparticles by the liver. Furthermore, compared with the MPSS-CSNPs and MPSS treatment groups, treatment with RBC-MPSS-CSNPs considerably inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- and IL-6, and consequently attenuated lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide in rats. Therefore, RBC-hitchhiking is a potentially effective strategy for the delivery of nanoparticles to the lungs for the treatment of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.","output":"RBC-hitchhiking chitosan nanoparticles loading methylprednisolone for lung-targeting delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Demyelination is a component of several viral diseases of humans.

These measures need to build on a solid scientific foundation and be ready for practical use at the same time. Therefore, the aim of the study is to present a participatory approach to identify, minimize, and eliminate workplace-specific COVID-19 transmission within child care. The approach presented combines quantitative as well as qualitative elements and includes a screening of critical workplace conditions and the development of preventive measures to foster a safe workplace design. METHODS: First, 428 employees of different child care facilities in a large German city reported their subjective risk of infection, fear of infection, and support received by the employer. Second, the participants commented in detail about high risk conditions during work. Third, employees provided suggestions for preventive measures. We conducted a qualitative analysis of free text answers to evaluate which aspects are perceived as critical from an employee perspective. RESULTS: Participants provided valuable and practicable ideas on how to design and improve preventive measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission in child care dealing with structural conditions, the interaction with the parents, the implementation of preventive measures and recommendations for policy makers.

There is growing interest in utilising digital technologies to facilitate aspects of focus group research. To date, no study in the pharmacy profession has comprehensively described and evaluated a fully virtual process to focus group research, from recruitment to reimbursement. OBJECTIVE(S) This study aims to describe an entirely online approach to: recruiting for and facilitating virtual focus group discussions, and reimbursement of participants within the pharmacy profession. Specifically, our objectives were to identify 1) the dropout rate, 2) the geographic diversity of focus group participants, and 3) the occurrence of technological issues. METHOD Traditional face-to-face focus group recruitment and facilitation methods were adapted, pre-tested, and conducted using online platforms for advertising, participant expressions of interest, participant consent, focus group facilitation, and participant reimbursement. Populations of interest included community pharmacists, specialty practice pharmacists, hospital pharmacists, and pharmacy assistants and technicians across Australia. RESULTS Of the 153 potential participants who either completed an expression of interest to participate (135/153) or agreed to participate after direct contact (18/153), 59 confirmed that they would attend the focus group discussion (39%); 49 of the 59 (dropout rate: 17%) participated in one of eight focus groups. Collectively, there was representation from all States and Territories in Australia, as well as representation in each of the populations of interest. Three of 49 participants (6%) experienced minor technological issues during the process; no participant encountered major technological issues that precluded successful participation. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that an entirely online approach to focus group methodology is possible, has the potential to recruit demographically and geographically-diverse participants with low dropout rates, and can be successfully conducted with minimal technological issues. Despite the recent COVID-19 pandemic making physical focus group facilitation untenable, this fully-online approach enables research to be completed uninterrupted.","output":"Let's talk virtual!

Specifically, we compare DNN (Deep Neural Network)-based and non-DNN methods for generating evacuation strategies that minimize evacuation time while allowing for social distancing in emergency vehicles. A central question is whether a DNN-based method provides sufficient extra routing efficiency to accommodate increased social distancing in a time-constrained evacuation operation. We describe the problem as a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and solve it using a non-DNN solution (Sweep Algorithm) and a DNN-based solution (Deep Reinforcement Learning). The DNN-based solution can provide decision-makers with more efficient routing than the typical non-DNN routing solution. However, it does not come close to compensating for the extra time required for social distancing, and its advantage disappears as the emergency vehicle capacity approaches the number of people per household.","output":"Routing algorithms as tools for integrating social distancing with emergency evacuation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCW) are potentially at increased risk of infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and may transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to vulnerable patients.

COVID-19 affected over 200 countries and territories worldwide, with 25,541,380 confirmed cases and 852,000 deaths associated with COVID-19 globally, as of September 1, 2020.(1) While facing such a public health emergency, hospitals were on the front line to deliver health care and psychological services. The early detection, diagnosis, reporting, isolation, and clinical management of patients during a public health emergency required the extensive involvement of hospitals in all aspects. The response capacity of hospitals directly determined the outcomes of the prevention and control of an outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all nations and territories regardless of their development level or geographic location, although suitable risk mitigation measures differ between developing and developed countries. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the consequences of the pandemic could be more complicated because incidence and mortality might be associated more with a fragile health care system and shortage of related resources.2, 3 As evidenced by the situation in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, South Africa, and other LMICs, socioeconomic status (SES) disparity was a major factor in the spread of disease, potentially leading to alarmingly insufficient preparedness and responses in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.(4) Conversely, the pandemic might also bring more unpredictable socioeconomic and long-term impacts in LMICs, and those with lower SES fare worse in these situations. This review aimed to summarize the responsibilities of and measures taken by hospitals in combatting the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was completed by 2722 persons with Multiple Sclerosis, after Italy instituted a national lockdown in response to the pandemic. RESULTS: Persons with Multiple Sclerosis reported that the pandemic caused broad disruptions to usual health and social care services, which impacted on their health and wellbeing. Disruptions in care were consistently associated with negative self-reported impacts on the expected progression of the disease, on out-of-pocket expenditure and on carers stress. Psychological consequences were associated with interruption to usual psychological support, and concerns about the safety of care delivered in person. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life of persons with Multiple Sclerosis depends greatly on prompt access to a broad range of health and care services. Negative psychological impacts reported by persons with Multiple Sclerosis with less severe disabilities show that accessible integrated services are crucial for maintenance of their wellbeing. Most persons with Multiple Sclerosis with more severe disability experienced negative impacts on perceived health. Their carers compensating for lack of social input resulted in care overburden. As continuity of care is crucial for persons with Multiple Sclerosis, as well as for persons with chronic conditions in general, strategies must be in place to ensure it is included in future pandemic response plans.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on persons with multiple sclerosis: Early findings from a survey on disruptions in care and self-reported outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, I begin by providing a brief survey of recent research that highlights some of the key empirical facts about credit cycles.

Lung is a major target and many patients die of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).The SARSCoV- 2 attachment protein spike (S) mediates fusion to the cell membrane via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, highly expressed in lung cells. Coronaviruses can follow several cellular entry pathways, fusing on the cell or inside the endosome. The HRC-peptides, which bind to S, can prevent viral entry only in those fusing at the cell membrane, but they are ineffective on the others. To overcome this limitation, we modified the HRC-peptide by adding: (i) cholesterol to allow better penetration within the endosomes;(ii) a second HRC-peptide to improve local half-life. The modified peptide, [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol (Fig. 1A), has been evaluated for: 1) its antiviral potency in vitro;2), biodistribution in vivo.Our hypothesis is that [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol delivered intranasally will be effective in blocking SARSCoV- 2 entry in lung cells, avoiding progressive respiratory failure in COVID-19.MethodsBiodistribution in mice: [SARSHRCPEG4] 2-chol was intranasally or subcutaneously administered to hACE2 mice. Lungs and plasma samples were analyzed by ELISA with anti-HRC antibody.Ex-vivo toxicity assay: to test [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol cytotoxicity, we used a 3D human airway epithelium (HAE) model, constituted of human-derived tracheal/bronchial epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface. HAE were incubated with [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol and cytotoxicity was measured at 6 days from the incubation using tetrazolium salt (MTT) assay. In vitro assay: antiviral potency of [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol was tested using a cell-cell fusion assay based on complementation of split -galactosidase (-gal) activity. When the two fragments of -gal combine to generate a catalytically active enzyme, activity is quantified via the luminescence resulting from substrate processed by -gal. Lack of -gal activity could result from fusion blockade.Results [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol showed no cytotoxic activity on HAE (Fig. 1B). [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol potently inhibited -gal activity with an IC50 of 3nM (Fig. 1C). In hACE2 mice, [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol administered intranasally remained at high levels in the lung with minimal bloodstream entry, while [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol administered subcutaneous, resulted in undetectable levels in the lungs and similar half-life in the blood (Fig. 1D).Conclusions [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol efficiently blocked activity in SARS-CoV-2 S fusion assay in vitro, showed no toxicity for human lung epithelium ex vivo, and given intranasally in vivo, it is predominantly localized in the airways. Ongoing studies will establish the therapeutic potential of [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol in treating SARS-CoV-2 using an in vivorodent model of infection.","output":"Study of a fusion inhibitory lipopeptide to prevent sars-cov-2 infection and transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer have always been one of the research hotspots in the medical field. Early diagnosis and treatment of this disease are necessary means to improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients and reduce their mortality. The introduction of computer-aided diagnosis technology can easily, quickly, and accurately identify the lung nodule area as an imaging feature of early lung cancer for the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer and is helpful for the quantitative analysis of the characteristics of lung nodules and is useful for distinguishing benign and malignant lung nodules. Growth provides an objective diagnostic reference standard. This paper studies ITK and VTK toolkits and builds a system platform with MFC. By studying the process of doctors diagnosing lung nodules, the whole system is divided into seven modules: suspected lung shadow detection, image display and image annotation, and interaction. The system passes through the entire lung nodule auxiliary diagnosis process and obtains the number of nodules, the number of malignant nodules, and the number of false positives in each set of lung CT images to analyze the performance of the auxiliary diagnosis system. In this paper, a lung region segmentation method is proposed, which makes use of the obvious differences between the lung parenchyma and other human tissues connected with it, as well as the position relationship and shape characteristics of each human tissue in the image. Experiments are carried out to solve the problems of lung boundary, inaccurate segmentation of lung wall, and depression caused by noise and pleural nodule adhesion. Experiments show that there are 2316 CT images in 8 sets of images of different patients, and the number of nodules is 56. A total of 49 nodules were detected by the system, 7 were missed, and the detection rate was 87.5%. A total of 64 false-positive nodules were detected, with an average of 8 per set of images. This shows that the system is effective for CT images of different devices, pixel pitch, and slice pitch and has high sensitivity, which can provide doctors with good advice.","output":"Design Computer-Aided Diagnosis System Based on Chest CT Evaluation of Pulmonary Nodules"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Objective To analyze the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic renal failure complicated with novel coronavirus pneumonia, and to evaluate the effect of blood purification technology on the treatment and prognosis of such patients Methods Two COVID-19 cases undergoing hemodialysis with chronic renal failure were retrospectively analysed in our hospital.

Afterwards, LaLigas teams completed 11 matches, with approximately 3 days of recovery between matches, to finish the competition. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether there is a difference in mean injury incidence in LaLiga players between the pre-lockdown period and post-lockdown period. A total of 277 players belonging to 11 teams competing in LaLiga were monitored during the 2019C2020 season. Injury incidence in the 27 matchdays completed before the lockdown was compared to the last 11 matchdays completed after the resumption of the competition. In comparison to the period before the suspension, the resumption of the championship did not significantly affect the injury incidence (4.2 vs. 5.4 injuries per 1000 h of exposure, p = 0.338). Injury incidence before suspension and after resumption of the competition was similar for muscle (2.6 vs. 3.4 injuries per 1000 h of exposure, p = 0.152) and ligament injuries (0.8 vs. 0.4 injuries per 1000 h of exposure, p = 0.062).

Several public health and social protective measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of COVID-19 were introduced. However, these measures are unfortunately being neglected or deliberately ignored by some individuals. METHODS: a cross sectional online based survey was conducted to identify possible factors influencing public willingness to adhere to precautionary measures and preventive guidelines against COVID-19 during the lockdown periods in Sudan. The questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data of study participants, their health beliefs and willingness regarding adherence to precautionary measures against COVID-19 based on the constructs of the Health Belief Model. RESULTS: a total of 680 respondents completed and returned the online questionnaire. Significant predictors of the willingness to adhere to the precautionary measures against COVID-19 were gender (= 3.34, P<0.001), self-efficacy (= 0.476, P<0.001), perceived benefits (= 0.349, P<0.001) and perceived severity (= 0.113, P=0.005).

A number of factors, including limited radiotherapy resources, waiting times, and patient convenience, suggest single fraction to be the treatment of choice for patients. However, international patterns of practice indicate that multiple fractions are still commonly used. This study examined whether dose-fractionation schemes used for the treatment of bone metastases at the Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program (RRRP) at the Odette Cancer Centre have changed since 1999. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the prospective RRRP database and hospital records were conducted for all patients treated with palliative radiotherapy for uncomplicated bone metastases at the RRRP in 1999 (or baseline), 2001, 2004 and from 1 January to 31 July 2005. Data were collected on patient demographics and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 693 patients, 65 and 35% were prescribed single fraction (predominantly single 8 Gy) and multiple fractions (predominantly 20 Gy/five fractions), respectively. The administration of single treatments generally increased over time, from 51% in 1999 to 66% in 2005 (P = 0.0001).

Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome on nasopharyngeal swab samples is currently the reference test. While displaying excellent analytical sensitivity and specificity, this test is costly, often requires a substantial turnaround time, and, more importantly, is subject to reagent and other material shortages. To complement this technology, rapid antigen tests have been developed and made available worldwide, allowing cheap, quick, and decentralized SARS-CoV-2 testing. The main drawback of these tests is the reduced sensitivity when RT-PCR is the gold standard. In this study, we evaluate Visby an innovative, portable, easy-to-use RT-PCR point-of-care (POC) diagnostic device. Our retrospective analysis shows that overall, compared to the Cobas 6800 RT-qPCR assay (Roche), this RT-PCR POC technology detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA with 95% sensitivity (95%CI = 86.3-99%) and 100% specificity (95% CI = 80.5-100%). For samples with cycle-threshold values below 31, we observed 100% sensitivity (95% CI = 66.4-100%). While showing an analytical sensitivity slightly below that of a standard RT-qPCR system, the evaluated Visby RT-PCR POC device may prove to be an interesting diagnostic alternative in the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially combining the practical advantages of rapid antigen tests and the robust analytical performances of nucleic acid detection systems.","output":"Analytical Evaluation of Visby Medical RT-PCR Portable Device for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gut microbiota takes part in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinical research has found that probiotics have a beneficial effect on active ulcerative colitis, but to date, significant efficacy has rarely been found in the use of probiotics in the remission phase of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. More studies are needed to assess the utilization of probiotics in IBD remission. In this study, we assessed the administration of Bacillus subtilis in remission and its possible mechanism in mice with IBD. Oral administration of B. subtilis was implemented for 6 weeks (dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-P6w group), 2 weeks (DSS-P2w group) or 0 weeks (DSS-control(CT) group) in the remission phase in rodents with (DSS)-induced IBD. The body weight, colon length and disease activity index (DAI) were recorded, and colon H&E staining was performed. The expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) mRNA and epithelium proliferation-related Ki67 was detected. Gut microbiota were tested by 16S rRNA sequencing. Administration of B. subtilis in remission effectively increased the body weight and colon length and decreased DAI in the DSS-P6w group compared with the DSS-CT group, but there is no significant difference between the DSS-P2w and DSS-CT groups. The epithelial integrity was improved, and the expression of ZO-1 and occludin increased due to administration of B. subtilis in remission, which was more evident in the DSS-P6w group. The expression of Ki67 increased in the DSS-CT group compared with that in the CT group. The administration of B. subtilis effectively down-regulated the expression of Ki67 in the DSS-P6w and DSS-P2w groups compared with the DSS-CT group. Furthermore, gut microbial structure was improved, with significantly decreased Escherichia/Shigella and Enterococcus, and increased Akkermansia and corresponding microbial function in the DSS-P6w group. Short-term administration of B. subtilis in the remission phase showed no significant improvement in mice with IBD. Long-term and continuous supplementation of B. subtilis in remission could effectively maintain the remission by protecting epithelial integrity, regulating proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, and improving gut microbiota and the corresponding microbial function.","output":"Long-term and continuous administration of Bacillus subtilis during remission effectively maintains the remission of inflammatory bowel disease by protecting intestinal integrity, regulating epithelial proliferation, and reshaping microbial structure and function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isolated methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) and propionic acidaemia (PA) are rare inherited metabolic diseases.

In the Northeast United States, fishers grappled with low prices and disruptions to export and domestic markets, leaving many tied to the dock, while others found ways to adapt to the changing circumstances brought about by the pandemic. This paper investigates the short-term impacts of the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) on commercial fishers in the Northeast U.S. to understand the effects of the pandemic on participation in the fishery and fishers economic outcomes, using data collected from an online survey of 258 Northeast U.S. commercial fishers. This research also assesses characteristics of those fishers who continued fishing and their adaptive strategies to the changing circumstances. Analysis of survey responses found the majority of fishers continued fishing during the early months of the pandemic, while a significant number had stopped fishing. Nearly all reported a loss of income, largely driven by disruptions of export markets, the loss of restaurant sales, and a resulting decline in seafood prices. Landings data demonstrate that while fishing pressure in 2020 was reduced for some species, it remained on track with previous years for others. Fishers reported engaging in a number of adaptation strategies, including direct sales of seafood, switching species, and supplementing their income with government payments or other sources of income. Many fishers who had stopped fishing indicated plans to return, suggesting refraining from fishing as a short-term adaptation strategy, rather than a plan to permanently stop fishing. Despite economic losses, fishers in the Northeast U.S. demonstrated resilience in the face of the pandemic by continuing to fish and implementing other adaptation strategies rather than switching to other livelihoods.","output":"Adaptation and resilience of commercial fishers in the Northeast United States during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to identifying the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw and treated wastewater during the COVID-19 outbreak in Tehran, Qom and Anzali cities (Iran).

It is clinically mirrored by the occurrence of exacerbations of complement mediated diseases during COVID-19 infection. These include complement-mediated hemolytic anemias such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), particularly cold agglutinin disease (CAD), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). All these conditions may benefit from complement inhibitors that are also under study for COVID-19 disease. Hemolytic exacerbations in these conditions may occur upon several triggers including infections and vaccines and may require transfusions, treatment with complement inhibitors and/or immunosuppressors (i.e., steroids and rituximab for AIHA), and result in thrombotic complications. In this manuscript we describe four patients (2 with PNH and 2 with CAD) who experienced hemolytic flares after either COVID-19 infection or SARS-Cov2 vaccine and provide a review of the most recent literature. We report that most episodes occurred within the first 10 days after COVID-19 infection/vaccination and suggest laboratory monitoring (Hb and LDH levels) in that period. Moreover, in our experience and in the literature, hemolytic exacerbations occurring during COVID-19 infection were more severe, required greater therapeutic intervention, and carried more complications including fatalities, as compared to those developing after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, suggesting the importance of vaccinating this patient population. Patient education remains pivotal to promptly recognize signs/symptoms of hemolytic flares and to refer to medical attention. Treatment choice should be based on the severity of the hemolytic exacerbation as well as of that of COVID-19 infection. Therapies include transfusions, complement inhibitor initiation/additional dose in the case of PNH, steroids/rituximab in patients with CAD and warm type AIHA, plasma exchange, hemodialysis and complement inhibitor in the case of atypical HUS. Finally, anti-thrombotic prophylaxis should be always considered in these settings, provided safe platelet counts.","output":"Complement Mediated Hemolytic Anemias in the COVID-19 Era: Case Series and Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presence of snow and ice on runway surfaces reduces the available tire-pavement friction needed for retardation and directional control and causes potential economic and safety threats for the aviation industry during the winter seasons. To activate appropriate safety procedures, pilots need accurate and timely information on the actual runway surface conditions.

The models are trained on weather data and data from runway reports. The runway surface conditions are represented by the tire-pavement friction coefficient, which is estimated from flight sensor data from landing aircrafts. To evaluate the performance of the models, they are compared to several state-of-the-art runway assessment methods. The XGBoost models identify slippery runway conditions with a ROC AUC of 0.95, predict the friction coefficient with a MAE of 0.0254, and outperforms all the previous methods. The results show the strong abilities of machine learning methods to model complex, physical phenomena with a good accuracy when domain knowledge is used in the variable extraction.

Furthermore, cell surface expression was slightly greater than wild-type ACE2, suggesting that the design is well-folded and stable.

Mathematical biology seeks to explain biophysical processes in mathematical terms at, and across, all relevant spatial and temporal scales, through the generation of representative models. While non-spatial, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are often used and readily calibrated to experimental data, they do not explicitly represent the spatial and stochastic features of a biological system, limiting their insights and applications. However, spatial models describing biological systems with spatial information are mathematically complex and computationally expensive, which limits the ability to calibrate and deploy them and highlights the need for simpler methods able to model the spatial features of biological systems. RESULTS: In this work, we develop a formal method for deriving cell-based, spatial, multicellular models from ODE models of population dynamics in biological systems, and vice versa. We provide examples of generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from ODE models of viral infection and immune response. In these models, the determinants of agreement of spatial and non-spatial models are the degree of spatial heterogeneity in viral production and rates of extracellular viral diffusion and decay. We show how ODE model parameters can implicitly represent spatial parameters, and cell-based spatial models can generate uncertain predictions through sensitivity to stochastic cellular events, which is not a feature of ODE models. Using our method, we can test ODE models in a multicellular, spatial context and translate information to and from non-spatial and spatial models, which help to employ spatiotemporal multicellular models using calibrated ODE model parameters. We additionally investigate objects and processes implicitly represented by ODE model terms and parameters and improve the reproducibility of spatial, stochastic models. CONCLUSION: We developed and demonstrate a method for generating spatiotemporal, multicellular models from non-spatial population dynamics models of multicellular systems. We envision employing our method to generate new ODE model terms from spatiotemporal and multicellular models, recast popular ODE models on a cellular basis, and generate better models for critical applications where spatial and stochastic features affect outcomes.

Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO2/FiO2 (mmHg) when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population-based survival during the current US COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life critically ill COVID-19 patients as they transitioned to either recovery or death. Two patient groups were simulated (50,000 patients in each group); (1) Patients received tPA immediately upon diagnosis of ARDS and (2) patients received standard therapy for ARDS. Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO2/FiO2 of < 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria). Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated. Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature. RESULTS: The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs. 71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients. When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs. 75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs. 168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios.

Knowing what patients are searching for online can help plastic surgeons understand public interest, enhance patient engagement, and improve service provision. This study analyses the correlation between Google Trends (GT) search activity and the number of cosmetic procedures carried out in the UK. METHODS: GT search term data were analysed for popularity of use and geographical variation in the UK. Pearsons correlation coefficient was used to analyse GT data against the number of cosmetic surgery procedures undertaken in the UK in the corresponding year and with 1-year time lag. RESULTS: GT score was higher for most colloquial search terms, such as tummy tuck compared to abdominoplasty (GT score 59 vs 6), but otoplasty was higher than ear correction (GT score 55 vs 19). Geographical variation showed that London ranked first in proportional search term activity for brow lift and Birmingham for tummy tuck. There was statistically significant positive correlation for three search terms and the number of corresponding surgeries undertaken. This increased to nine search terms when analysed with a 1-year time lag. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the trends in online search activity in the UK and their correlation with cosmetic procedures. The higher number of significant correlations with 1-year time lag may reflect the patients decision-making journey to undergo cosmetic surgery. These results can be utilised for SEO, thus leading to a better-informed public and more robust practice building.

We recruited 28 healthy individuals: 12 aged 23-70 years for cardiac 31P-MRS, and 16 aged 60-75 years for skeletal muscle 31P-MRS. Baseline and post-intervention resting cardiac and dynamic skeletal muscle 31P-MRS scans were performed in one visit, where 25 g of the ketone monoester, deltaG?, was administered after the baseline scan. Administration was timed so that post-intervention 31P-MRS would take place 30 min after deltaG? ingestion. The deltaG? ketone drink was well-tolerated by all participants. In participants who provided blood samples, post-intervention blood glucose, lactate and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations decreased significantly (-28.8%, p a?a 0.001; -28.2%, p = 0.02; and -49.1%, p a?a 0.001, respectively), while levels of the ketone body D-beta-hydroxybutyrate significantly increased from mean (standard deviation) 0.7 (0.3) to 4.0 (1.1) mmol/L after 30 min (p a?a 0.001). There were no significant changes in cardiac PCr/ATP or skeletal muscle metabolic parameters between baseline and post-intervention. Acute ketone supplementation caused mild ketosis in blood, with drops in glucose, lactate, and free fatty acids; however, such changes were not associated with changes in 31P-MRS measures in the heart or in skeletal muscle. Future work may focus on the effect of longer-term ketone supplementation on tissue energetics in groups with compromised mitochondrial function.","output":"Evaluation of Acute Supplementation With the Ketone Ester (R)-3-Hydroxybutyl-(R)-3-Hydroxybutyrate (deltaG) in Healthy Volunteers by Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the use of applications to improve dietary habits has increased. Although numerous nutrition apps are available on the market, only few have been developed by health and nutrition professionals based on scientific evidence and subsequently tested to prove their usability. The main objective of this study was to design, develop, and evaluate the usability of a tailored nutrition application to be used to promote healthy eating habits. In order to decide app design and content, three focus groups took place with fifteen professionals from primary healthcare, nutrition, and food science and computer science, as well as expert users. For the general and feedback message design, a reference model based on the scientific literature was developed. To address the multi-perspective approach of users' and external healthcare professionals' feedback, a one-day pilot testing with potential users and healthcare professionals was conducted with four focus groups. To evaluate the relevance and potential usability of the app a 1-month pilot test was conducted in a real-life environment. A total of 42 volunteers participated in the one-day pilot testing, and 39 potential users participated in the 1-month pilot test. The SAlBi educa app developed includes an online dietary record, a self-monitoring tool to evaluate dietary patterns, general and feedback messages, and examples of traditional Mediterranean recipes. The usability study showed that volunteers think that SAlBi educa is pleasant (59%) and easy to learn to use (94%). Over 84% of the volunteers declared that the nutritional messages were clear and useful. Volunteers stated that general and tailored recommendations, as well as self-monitoring, were SAlBi educa's most motivating and useful features. SAlBi educa is an innovative, user-friendly nutritional education tool with the potential to engage and help individuals to follow dietary habits based on the Mediterranean model.","output":"SAlBi educa (Tailored Nutrition App for Improving Dietary Habits): Initial Evaluation of Usability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The initial onset of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, in humans was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

The objective of this study was to describe characteristics, self-reported symptoms, and predictors of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community-based sample. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a cross-sectional nationwide survey of adults in the US conducted between April 24 through May 13, 2020. The survey targeted a representative sample of approximately 5,000 respondents. The rate of COVID-19 cases and testing, most frequently reported symptoms, symptom severity, treatment received, impact of COVID-19 on mental and physical health, and factors predictive of testing positive were assessed. Most of the 5,203 participants (85.6%) reported no COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the 747 (14.5%) participants reporting COVID-19-like symptoms, 367 (49.1%) obtained a diagnostic test. Eighty-nine participants (24.3%) reported a positive COVID-19 test result, representing 1.7% of the total sample. For those testing positive, the most common symptoms were dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath/difficulty breathing. Those who tested positive were more likely to report greater symptom severity versus those who tested negative. Severe dry cough, new loss of taste or smell, trouble waking up, living with someone experiencing symptoms, recent international travel, respiratory issues, and reporting ethnicity of Black or African American were predictive of testing positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 using community-level self-reported data across the US during the peak of most stay at home orders. Self-reported symptoms and risk factors identified in this study are consistent with the clinical profile emerging for COVID-19. In the absence of widespread testing, this study demonstrates the utility of a representative US community-based sample to provide direct-reported symptoms and outcomes to quickly identify high-risk individuals who are likely to test positive and should consider taking greater precautions.","output":"COVID-19 prevalence and predictors in United States adults during peak stay-at-home orders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The closing of schools due to Covid-19 has brought a dimension of uncertainty into STEM education Despite the closing of schools due to the need to observe physical distancing, some schools have found ways to continue teaching and learning on virtual platforms enabled by increasingly pervasive fourth industrial revolution environments In this study, the teaching of Ordinary level mathematics and science in pursuit of STEM education goals as enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) in online classrooms was therefore, explored Using an interpretive case study, relevant data were collected from two mathematics and three science teachers during semi-structured interviews These participants communicated their experiences in transitioning from face-to-face to online classrooms as they worked to promote STEM education during the Covid-19 pandemic The findings reveal teachers' experiences of this transition and their selection of particular Web 2 0 tools to establish online classrooms Notably, mobile instant messaging tools proved to be a popular option for being cheap, user-friendly, temporal, and multimodal The findings also revealed that teachers struggled to adapt the hands-on activities to suit online teaching resulting in the use of teacher-centred approaches","output":"Covid-19 as an Agent of Change in Teaching and Learning Stem Subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pathogenesis of colorectal cancer is a multifactorial process.

Many of these have risk factors such as old age or pre-existing conditions and, therefore, are at the focus of protective measures. This article determines the number of people at risk in Germany and differentiates them according to age, sex, education, household type and federal state. The analyses presented here are based on data from the German Health Update (GEDA) 2019/2020-EHIS, which was carried out as a nationwide cross-sectional telephone-based survey between April 2019 and October 2020. The definition of being at increased risk of severe COVID-19 is primarily based on a respondents age and the presence of pre-existing conditions. Around 36.5 million people in Germany are at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. Of these, 21.6 million belong to the high-risk group. An above-average number of people at risk live alone. The prevalence of an increased risk is higher among middle-aged men than among women of the same age, and significantly higher among people with a low level of education than among people with a high level of education. The highest proportion of people with an increased risk live in Saarland and in the eastern German federal states. When fighting the pandemic, it is important to account for the fact that more than half of the population aged 15 or over is at increased risk of severe illness. Moreover, the regional differences in risk burden should be taken into account when planning interventions.","output":"Population with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 in Germany.

Objectives: To understand the effectiveness of NPIs reported in the contemporary literatures describing prediction models for prevention of the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 specifically in Indian population. Methods: Original research articles in English obtained through keyword search in PubMed, WHO Global Database for COVID19, and pre-print servers were included in the review. Thematic synthesis of extracted data from articles were done. Results: Twenty-four articles were found eligible for the review - four published articles and twenty pre-print articles. Compartmental model was found to be the most commonly used mathematical model; along with exponential, time varying, neural network and cluster kinetic models. Social distancing, specifically lockdown, was the most commonly modelled intervention strategy. Additionally, contact tracing using smartphone application, international travel restriction, increasing hospital/ICU beds, changes in testing strategy were also dealt with. Social distancing along with increasing testing seemed to be effective in delaying the peak of the epidemic and reducing the peak prevalence. Conclusion: Although there is mathematical rationality behind implementation of social distancing measures including lockdown, this study also emphasised the importance of other associated measures like increasing tests and increasing the number of hospital and ICU beds.

Many developing countries have high mortality rates due to pneumonia because of the unavailability of proper and timely diagnostic measures. Using machine learning-based diagnosis methods can help to detect the disease early and in less time and cost. In this study, we proposed a novel method to determine the presence of pneumonia and identify its type (bacterial or viral) through analyzing chest radiographs. We performed a three-class classification based on features containing diverse information of the samples. After using an augmentation technique to balance the dataset's sample sizes, we extracted the chest X-ray images' statistical features, as well as global features by employing a deep learning architecture. We then combined both sets of features and performed the final classification using the RandomForest classifier. A feature selection method was also incorporated to identify the features with the highest relevance. We tested the proposed method on a widely used (but relabeled) chest radiograph dataset to evaluate its performance. The proposed model can classify the dataset's samples with an 86.30% classification accuracy and 86.03% F-score, which assert the model's efficacy and reliability. However, results show that the classifier struggles while distinguishing between viral and bacterial pneumonia samples. Implementing this method will provide a fast and automatic way to detect pneumonia in a patient and identify its type.","output":"A Pneumonia Diagnosis Scheme Based on Hybrid Features Extracted from Chest Radiographs Using an Ensemble Learning Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus at an animal market in Wuhan, China. Many wildlife species have been suggested as possible intermediate sources for the transmission of COVID-19 virus from bats to humans. The quick transmission of COVID-19 outbreak has imposed quarantine measures across the world, and as a result, most of the world's towns and cities fell silent under lockdowns. The current study comes to investigate the ways by which the COVID-19 outbreak affects wildlife globally. Hundreds of internet sites and scientific reports have been reviewed to satisfy the needs of the study. Stories of seeing wild animals roaming the quiet, deserted streets and cities during the COVID-19 outbreak have been posted in the media and social media. The strong link between wildlife markets and COVID-19 resulted in international calls asking countries to shut down wildlife markets forever. Poorer and vulnerable people around the world overexploit natural resources including wildlife. Roadkills became minimal because of the lockdown measures. The reduction in noise pollution level is expected to improve wildlife health and ecology including breeding success. The shortage of food items provided to zoo and park animals constituted a real threat to animals and the institution harboring them. The increase in fish biomass comes as a result of the sharp decline in fishing activities. The isolation of antibodies from certain wildlife species is promising in saving humankind against COVID-19. The infection of wild and pet animals with COVID-19 virus from humans and the interspecific transmission of the infection are disastrous to animal ecology. Finally, closures may enhance people to connect more and more with nature in order to acknowledge wildlife in their surrounding environments.

The economic analysis of crime tells us that potential offenders will compare the costs and the benefits from crime and from innocence and then choose whichever option that is more profitable. We must therefore ask ourselves how this comparison is affected by the outbreak of a pandemic and the policy changes which may accompany it, such as governmental restrictions, social distancing, and economic crises. Using insights from law and economics, this article investigates how the various components in the cost-benefit analysis of crime might change during a pandemic, focusing on COVID-19 as a test case. Building on classical theoretical models, existing empirical evidence, and behavioral aspects, the analysis reveals that there are many potentially countervailing effects on crime deterrence. The article thus highlights the need to carefully consider which aspects are applicable given the circumstances of the pandemic, as whether crime deterrence will increase or decrease should depend on the strength of the effects at play.","output":"Crime and Punishment in Times of Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Influenza epidemics were initially considered to be a suitable model for the COVID-19 epidemic, but there is a lack of data concerning patients with chronic respiratory diseases (CRD), who were supposed to be at risk of severe forms of COVID-19. METHODS: This nationwide retrospective cohort study describes patients with prior lung disease hospitalised for COVID-19 (March-April 2020) or influenza (2018-2019 influenza outbreak). We compare the resulting pulmonary complications, need for intensive care and in-hospital mortality depending on respiratory history and virus. RESULTS: In the 89a??530 COVID-19 cases, 16.03% had at least one CRD, which was significantly less frequently than in the 45a??819 seasonal influenza patients. Patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension were underrepresented, contrary to those with lung cancer, sleep apnea, emphysema, and interstitial pulmonary diseases (ILD). COVID-19 patients with CRD developed significantly more ventilator-associated pneumonia and pulmonary embolism than influenza patients. They needed intensive care significantly more often and had a higher mortality rate (except for asthma) when compared to patients with COVID-19 but without CRD, or patients with influenza.

Materials and Methods: Free COVID-19 vaccination camps, both non incentivised (8 days) and incentivised (8 days), were organised in month of June and July, 2021 at a hospital in association with an NGO under the supervision of District Immunisation Officer. The retrospective observational study was done and data of all vaccinations done was compared to document the effect of incentivised free vaccination camp as compared to non incentivised camps. Data was represented as frequency, percentage and Chi-square test was used. Results: Total of 4111 vaccinations were done during the free vaccination camps, including 1406 during non incentivised and 2705 during incentivised camps. During non incentivised camps 1114 people were given 1st dose and 292 were given 2nd dose, while during incentivised camps 2334 people were given 1st dose and 371 were given 2nd dose. Analysis of the data showed that the difference in number of 1st dose and 2nd dose vaccinations done during the incentivised vaccination camps was statistically significantly higher as compared to the number of 1st dose and 2nd dose vaccinations done during non incentivised vaccination camps. Similar results showed that the difference in number of vaccination done among the age groups of 18-44 years and >44 years during the incentivised vaccination camps was statistically significantly higher as compared to the number of vaccination among the age groups of 18-44 years and >44 years done during the non incentivised vaccination camps.

The concentrations of NaCl for complete inhibition of Fe2+ oxidation by cells initially grown with ferrous iron sulfate, or tetrathionate, or pyrite as energy sources were 525 mM, 725 mM, and 800 mM, respectively. Noticeably, regardless of NaCl concentrations, oxygen consumption rates of S. thermosulfidooxidans with 20 mM tetrathionate were higher than with 50 mM FeSO4. NaCl concentrations of higher than 400 mM strongly inhibited the iron respiration of S. thermosulfidooxidans. In contrast, the presence of NaCl was shown to stimulate tetrathionate oxidation. This trend was especially pronounced in NaCl-adapted cells where respiration rates at 200 mM NaCl were threefold of those in the absence of NaCl. In NaCl-adapted cultures greater respiration rates for tetrathionate were observed than in non-NaCl-adapted cultures, especially at concentrations  200 mM NaCl. At concentrations of  200 mM NaCl, cell growth and iron oxidation were enhanced with the addition of increasing concentrations of yeast extract. Thus, cell numbers in cultures with 0.05% yeast extract were  5 times higher than without yeast extract addition. At NaCl concentration as high as 400 mM, however, iron oxidation rates improved compared to control assays without yeast extract, but there was no clear dependence on yeast extract concentrations. The initial growth of bacteria with and without yeast extract in the presence of different NaCl concentrations was shown to impact leaching of copper from chalcopyrite. Copper dissolution was enhanced in the presence of 200 mM NaCl and absence of yeast extract, while the addition of 0.02 % yeast extract was shown to promote copper solubilization in the presence of 500 mM NaCl.","output":"Effect of Inoculum History, Growth Substrates and Yeast Extract Addition on Inhibition of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans by NaCl."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Estimate seroprevalence in representative samples from slum and non-slum communities in Mumbai, India, a mega-city in a low or middle-income country and test if prevalence is different in slums. Design: After geographically-spaced community sampling of households, one individual per household was tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N-protein in a two-week interval. Setting: Slum and non-slum communities in three wards, one each from the three main zones of Mumbai. Participants: Individuals over age 12 who consent to and have no contraindications to venipuncture were eligible. 6,904 participants (4,202 from slums and 2,702 from non-slums) were tested. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were the positive test rate for IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein by demographic group (age and gender) and location (slums and non-slums). The secondary outcome is seroprevalence at slum and non-slum levels. Sera was tested via chemiluminescence (CLIA) using Abbott Diagnostics ArchitectTM N-protein based test. Seroprevalence was calculated using weights to match the population distribution by age and gender and accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the test. Results: The positive test rate was 54.1% (95% CI: 52.7 to 55.6) and 16.1% (95% CI: 14.9 to 17.4) in slums and non-slums, respectively, a difference of 38 percentage points (P < 0.001). Accounting for imperfect accuracy of tests (e.g., sensitivity, 0.90; specificity 1.00), seroprevalence was as high as 58.4% (95% CI: 56.8 to 59.9) and 17.3% (95% CI: 16 to 18.7) in slums and non-slums, respectively. Conclusions: The high seroprevalence in slums implies a moderate infection fatality rate. The stark difference in seroprevalence across slums and non-slums has implications for the efficacy of social distancing, the level of herd immunity, and equity.

It is often estimated for various diseases through analysis of surveillance data, case reports, or record examinations. Reported CFR values for Yellow Fever vary, offering wide ranges. Estimates have not been found through systematic literature review, which has been used to estimate CFR of other diseases. This study aims to estimate the case fatality risk of severe Yellow Fever cases through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A search strategy was implemented in PubMed and Ovid Medline in June 2019 and updated in March 2021, seeking reported severe case counts, defined by fever and either jaundice or hemorrhaging, and the number of those that were fatal. The searches yielded 1,133 studies, and title/abstract review followed by full text review produced 14 articles reporting 32 proportions of fatal cases, 26 of which were suitable for meta-analysis. Four studies with one proportion each were added to include clinical case data from the recent outbreak in Brazil. Data were analyzed through an intercept-only logistic meta-regression with random effects for study. Values of the I(2) statistic measured heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: The estimated CFR was 39 % (95 % CI: 31 %, 47 %). Stratifying by continent showed that South America observed a higher CFR than Africa, though fewer studies reported estimates for South America. No difference was seen between studies reporting surveillance data and studies investigating outbreaks, and no difference was seen among different symptom definitions. High heterogeneity was observed across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 39 % of severe Yellow Fever cases are estimated to be fatal. This study provides the first systematic literature review to estimate the CFR of Yellow Fever, which can provide insight into outbreak preparedness and estimating underreporting.

Genetic studies indicate that the efficiency with which reovirus strains induce apoptosis is determined by the viral S1 gene, which encodes attachment protein sigma1. However, the biochemical properties of sigma1 that influence apoptosis induction are unknown. To determine whether the capacity of sigma1 to bind cell surface sialic acid determines the magnitude of the apoptotic response, we used isogenic reovirus mutants that differ in the capacity to engage sialic acid. We found that T3SA+, a virus capable of binding sialic acid, induces high levels of apoptosis in both HeLa cells and L cells. In contrast, non-sialic-acid-binding strain T3SA- induces little or no apoptosis in these cell types. Differences in the capacity of T3SA- and T3SA+ to induce apoptosis are not due to differences in viral protein synthesis or production of viral progeny. Removal of cell surface sialic acid with neuraminidase abolishes the capacity of T3SA+ to induce apoptosis. Similarly, incubation of T3SA+ with sialyllactose, a trisaccharide comprised of lactose and sialic acid, blocks apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that reovirus binding to cell surface sialic acid is a critical requirement for the efficient induction of apoptosis and suggest that virus receptor utilization plays an important role in regulating cell death.","output":"Reovirus binding to cell surface sialic acid potentiates virus-induced apoptosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Managers often make decisions in organizations without being aware of the results and hence, their effectiveness.

In preparation for the second wave, we sought to make such ramp down decisions more prudently and ethically. We report the development of a tool that can be used to make fair and ethical decisions in times of resource scarcity. We formed an interprofessional team to develop and use this tool to ensure that a diverse range of stakeholder perspectives were represented in this development process. This team, called the clinical activity recovery team, established institutional objectives that were combined with well-established procedural values, substantive ethical principles and decision-making criteria by using a variation on the well-known accountability for reasonableness ethical framework. The result of this is a stepwise, semiquantitative, ethical decision tool that can be applied to resource allocation challenges in order to reach fair and ethically defensible decisions.

RESULTS: Among 538 original records, 12 eligible articles were identified that analysed associations between ambient temperature exposure and stillbirth for 42,848 stillbirths among 3.4 million births across seven countries. Varied definitions of stillbirth were reported based on gestational age, birthweight, both, or neither. The overall rate of stillbirth ranged from 1.9 to 38.4 per 1000 among six high-income countries and one low-middle-income country. All study designs were retrospective and included ten cohort studies, three case-crossover studies, and two additional case-control subgroup analysis. Exposure data for ambient temperature was mostly derived from standard municipal or country-level monitors based on weather stations (66.6%) or a forecasting model (16.7%); otherwise, not reported (16.7%). Results were not statistically pooled for a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of methods and models among included studies. All studies reported associations of increased risk of stillbirth with ambient temperature exposures throughout pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy. One study estimates 17-19% (PAR) of stillbirths are potentially attributable to chronic exposure to hot and cold ambient temperatures during pregnancy. Overall, risk of stillbirth was observed to increase below 15 C and above 23.4 C, where highest risk is above 29.4 C. CONCLUSION: Exposure to hot and cold temperatures during pregnancy may increase the risk of stillbirth, although a clear causative mechanism remains unknown. Despite lack of causal evidence, existing evidence across diverse settings observed similar effects of increased risk of stillbirth using a variety of statistical and methodological approaches for exposure assessments, exposure windows, and data linkage. Managing exposure to ambient temperatures during pregnancy could potentially decrease risk of stillbirth, particularly among women in low-resource settings where access to safe antenatal and obstetric care is challenging. To fully understand the effects or dose-response relationship of maternal exposure to ambient temperatures and stillbirth, future studies should focus on biological mechanisms and contributing factors in addition to improving measurement of ambient temperature exposure.","output":"Systematic review of ambient temperature exposure during pregnancy and stillbirth: Methods and evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) has only recently been recognized as a new clinical entity in patients surviving their intensive care unit (ICU) stay due to critical illness.

Over 95% of deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is estimated that two-thirds of the congenital anomaly health burden could be averted through surgical intervention and that such interventions can be cost-effective. This systematic review aims to evaluate current evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of neonatal surgery for congenital anomalies in LMICs. Methods and analysis: A systematic literature review will be conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scielo, Google Scholar, African Journals OnLine and Regional WHO's African Index Medicus databases for articles on the cost-effectiveness of neonatal surgery for congenital anomalies in LMICs. The following search strings will be used: (1) congenital anomalies; (2) LMICs; and (3) cost-effectiveness of surgical interventions. Articles will be uploaded to Covidence software, duplicates removed and the remaining articles screened by two independent reviewers. Cost information for interventions or procedures will be extracted by country and condition. Outcome measurements by reported unit and cost-effectiveness ratios will be extracted. Methodological quality of each article will be assessed using the Drummond checklist for economic evaluations. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Effective Health Care Program guidance will be followed to assess the grade of the studies.

An interdisciplinary research team at University of Calgary partnered with Kaeja dDance to pilot test the effects of an intervention designed to facilitate embodied social connections among older adults. Within a mixed methods study design, pre and post behavioral tests and qualitative surveys about experiences of the body and connecting were administered to thirteen participants along with test instruments of loneliness and body appreciation. In the short-term, no significant changes were found on quantitative tests. Exploratory analysis revealed intervention improvements on individual body appreciation questions only. This indication of change was strongly supported by converging qualitative data and identified as relating to: increased connection through task-based collaboration, increased awareness of interpersonal boundaries, and a shift to experiencing the body as responsive. These indications of increased relational capacity were deemed likely to cause further impact in the long term. Examining this possibility and the subsequently arisen factor of COVID-19 risks and restrictions, test instruments were administered again to 10 participants 4 and 5 months after the intervention. A significant increase in loneliness was found. Despite this negative impact of COVID-19 isolation, several positive intervention changes remained detectable and some continued to increase over time. Seventy percent of the participants, who made new social contacts during the intervention and later sought continued contact, improved significantly across all body appreciation measures over the full study. The qualitative data from the last two time-points revealed both consistent values and new, negative changes. While these preliminary findings speak to the durability of intervention changes, they also identify areas of urgent priority to help older adults restore embodied relational capacity that has declined during COVID-19. Within the limitations of a small-sample pilot study, converging mixed methods results support the hypothesis that dance interventions designed for the purpose can positively affect the social inclusion of older adults. Although we recommend further study, these promising results also indicate that dance interventions can help older adults recover from pandemic isolation.","output":"Dance Intervention Affects Social Connections and Body Appreciation Among Older Adults in the Long Term Despite COVID-19 Social Isolation: A Mixed Methods Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of March 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been the cause of millions of deaths worldwide.

Five databases (PsycInfo, PsychArticles, ERIC, Sociological Abstracts, and PubMed) were searched systematically using keyword searches and inclusion/exclusion criteria; 29 eligible studies were included. Results demonstrated that the critical consciousness and wellbeing relationship varied by critical consciousness dimension and age. The studies of adolescents most often focused on racial/ethnic marginalization and found critical motivation most strongly associated with better wellbeing. The studies of young adults focused on young adult college students and identified mixed results specifically between activism and mental health. Study methods across age spans were primarily quantitative and cross-sectional.

METHODS The prospective cohort study included patients suffering from midline hernias equal to or bigger than 2 cm size and associated diastasis recti, from April 2011 to October 2012. Full endoscopic subcutaneous approach is used to perform the surgery. An ultrasound scan was carried out to identify inter-rectus distances and recurrences in xiphoid, 3 cm supraumbilical and 2 cm subumbilical locations. RESULTS A total of 21 patients were included in the study, with a mean follow-up of 20 months. The main complication was seroma. A significant reduction in the average distance between the rectus muscles was shown before surgery and at 1 month postoperative measures in all three locations (p < 0.001). No significant differences between the measured distances to the first and second year. A significant improvement at first postoperative year in cosmetic outcome compared with preoperative cosmetic condition (p < 0.001) was confirmed. Back pain improves significantly when diastasis recti is surgically corrected. CONCLUSIONS Totally endoscopic approach to diastasis recti associated with midline hernias is a feasible and reproducible method. It brings considerable esthetic advantages.

There are no known treatment regimens with proven efficacy and vaccines thus far, posing an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs and vaccines for prevention and treatment. The urgency for its prevention and cure has resulted in an increased number of proposed treatment options.

The variable clinical course of subclinical lymphadenopathy detected on breast imaging after COVID-19 vaccination creates management challenges and has led to evolving practice recommendations. Objective. To assess the duration of axillary lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to COVID-19 vaccination detected by breast imaging and to assess factors associated with the time until resolution. Methods. This retrospective single-center study included 111 patients (mean, 5212 years) with unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine administration performed within the prior 8 weeks that was detected on breast ultrasound performed between January 1st, 2021, and October 1st, 2021 and that underwent follow-up ultrasound examinations at 4-12 week intervals until resolution of the lymphadenopathy. Patient information was extracted from medical records. Cortical thickness of the largest axillary lymph node on ultrasound was retrospectively measured and was considered enlarged when greater than 3 mm. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of the time until resolution. Results. The mean cortical thickness on the initial ultrasound was 4.71.2 mm. The lymphadenopathy resolved a mean of 9744 days after the initial ultrasound and 12743 days after the first vaccine dose, as well as after a mean of 2.40.6 follow-up ultrasound examinations. Significant independent predictor of shorter time to resolution was Pfizer (rather than Moderna) vaccination [coefficient=-18.0 (95% CI: -34.3, -1.7); p=.03], and significant independent predictors of longer time to resolution were receipt of the second dose after the initial ultrasound [coefficient=19.2 (95% CI: 3.1, 35.2); p=.02] and greater cortical thickness on the initial ultrasound [coefficient=8.0 (95% CI: 1.5, 14.5); p=.02]. Patient age, prior history of breast cancer, and axillary symptoms were not significantly associated with time to resolution (all p>.05). Conclusion. Axillary lymphadenopathy detected by breast ultrasound after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination lasts longer than reported in initial vaccine clinical trials. Clinical Impact.

The most popular application of this type of interaction is drug development which requires a high throughput screening of a ligand that binds to the target protein. Our goal was to find a binding ligand with a simple detection, and once this type of ligand was found, other methods could then be used to measure the detailed kinetic or thermodynamic parameters. We started with the idea that the ligand NMR signal would disappear if it was bound to the non-tumbling mass. In order to create the non-tumbling mass, we tried the aggregates of a target protein, which was fused to the elastin-like polypeptide. We chose the maltose binding proteinas a test case, and we tried it with several sugars, which included maltose, glucose, sucrose, lactose, galactose, maltotriose, and -cyclodextrin. The maltose signal in the H-1 NMR spectrum disappeared completely as hoped around the protein to ligand ratio of 1:3 at 298 K where the proteins aggregated. The protein signals also disappeared upon aggregation except for the fast-moving part, which resulted in a cleaner background than the monomeric form. Since we only needed to look for a disappearing signal amongst those from the mixture, it should be useful in high throughput screening. Other types of sugars except for the maltotriose and -cyclodextrin, which are siblings of the maltose, did not seem to bind at all. We believe that our system would be especially more effective when dealing with a smaller target protein, so both the protein and the bound ligand would lose their signals only when the aggregates formed. We hope that our proposed method would contribute to accelerating the development of the potent drug candidates by simultaneously identifying several binders directly from a mixture.

The aim of this study is to identify the difficulties associated with eating during the working day in people diagnosed with IBD. A qualitative study was conducted through a nominal and focus group with people affected by IBD. After the thematic analysis of the data, three main themes emerged: management of food during the working day, searching for strategies to live with the disease, and the importance of visibility and support. This study shows that IBD influences the working life of people with IBD and makes it difficult to maintain an adequate diet.

However, few population-based seroprevalence surveys have been conducted to quantify attack rates and characterize drivers of transmission. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in ten cities in Colombia between September and December 2020. The study involved multi-stage cluster sampling at each city. Participants provided a serum sample and answered a demographic and risk factor questionnaire. Prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 was ascertained using the \\"SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) Advia Centaur - Siemens\\" chemiluminescence assay. FINDINGS: A total of 17863 participants from 7320 households participated in the study. Seroprevalence varied substantially between cities, ranging from 26% (95%CI 23C29 %) in Medelln to 68% (95%CI 62C74 %) in Guapi. There were no differences in seroprevalence by sex, but seropositivity was higher in certain ethnic groups. There was substantial heterogeneity in seroprevalence within cities, driven to a large extent by a strong association between socioeconomic stratum and seropositivity. INTERPRETATION: Colombia has been one of the Latin American countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study documented very high attack rates in several Colombian cities by the end of 2020 and identified key drivers of heterogeneities including ethnicity and socioeconomic stratum. Few studies of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 have been conducted in Latin America, and therefore this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of the pandemic in the region.

This study investigates the potential fungicidal effects of atorvastatin (ATO) combinations with fluconazole (FLU), itraconazole (ITR), ketoconazole (KET) and voriconazole (VOR) against thirty-four multidrug-resistant (MDR) C. albicans using checkerboard and time-kill methods. Results showed that 94.12% of these isolates were MDR to  two azole drugs, whereas 5.88% of them were susceptible to azole drugs. The tested isolates exhibited high resistance rates to FLU (58.82%), ITR (52.94%), VOR (47.06%) and KET (35.29%), whereas only three representative (8.82%) isolates were resistant to all tested azoles. Remarkably, the inhibition zones of these isolates were increased at least twofold with the presence of ATO, which interacted in a synergistic (FIC index  0.5) manner with tested azoles. In silico docking study of ATO and the four azole drugs were performed against the Lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase enzyme (ERG11) of C. albicans. Results showed that the mechanism of action of ATO against C. albicans is similar to that of azole compounds, with a docking score (?4.901) lower than azole drugs (5.0) due to the formation a single H-bond with Asp 225 and a piCpi interaction with Thr 229. Importantly, ATO combinations with ITR, VOR and KET achieved fungicidal effects ( 3 Log(10) cfu/ml reduction) against the representative isolates, whereas a fungistatic effect ( 3 Log(10) cfu/ml reduction) was observed with FLU combination.

Likewise, in Bangladesh, a growing number of adolescents are experiencing such symptoms though we have very limited research evidence available. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and the factors associated with this condition among urban, semi-urban, and rural school adolescents in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a two-stage cluster sampling procedure. A self-administered questionnaire was conveyed to 2355 adolescents from nine secondary schools of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Of the respondents, 2313 completed the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). Besides, sociodemographic information, self-reported body image as well as modification of Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ) and WHO Global PA Questionnaire (GPAQ) were used to determine the sociodemographic and lifestyle factors associated with anxiety among adolescents. RESULTS: A total of 20.1% of adolescents were experiencing moderate to severe anxiety; of them, a significantly higher proportion (49.9%) of female adolescents were suffering more than males (40.1%). Furthermore, age, students grade, fathers educational level, number of family members, and residential setting were found to be significantly associated with anxiety among adolescents. In terms of lifestyle factors, irregular physical activity (AOR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.05C1.63), high screen time (AOR: 1.51; 95% CI:1.21C1.88), sleep dissatisfaction (AOR: 3.79; 95% CI: 3.02C4.76), and underweight body image (AOR: 2.37; 95% CI:1.70C3.28) were found to be significantly associated with anxiety among school adolescents of urban, semi-urban, and rural residential settings.

This study tested the effect of angiotensin II type I receptor blocker, losartan, on SARS-CoV-2 replication and inhibition of the papain-like protease of the virus. METHODS The dose-dependent inhibitory effect of losartan, in concentrations from 1M to 100M as determined by quantitative cell analysis combining fluorescence microscopy, image processing, and cellular measurements (Cellomics analysis) on SARS-CoV-2 replication was investigated in Vero E6 cells. The impact of losartan on deubiquitination and deISGylation of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) were also evaluated. Results: Losartan reduced PLpro cleavage of tetraUbiquitin to diUbiquitin. It was less effective in inhibiting PLpro's cleavage of ISG15-AMC than Ubiquitin-AMC. To determine if losartan inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, losartan treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 was examined. Losartan treatment one hour prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 nuclear protein, an indicator of virus replication, by 80% and treatment one-hour post-infection decreased viral replication by 70%. CONCLUSION Losartan was not an effective inhibitor of deubiquitinase or deISGylase activity of the PLpro but affected the SARS-CoV-2 replication of Vero E6 cells in vitro.

One suggested approach to increase access and utilisation of HIV testing services is HIV self-testing. We explored perceptions of pregnant and lactating women and their male partners who attended antenatal care, and health care providers in a government hospital in Kampala, Uganda, about HIV self-testing for initial or repeat testing for women and their partners during pregnancy and postpartum We draw implications for scaling-up this new testing approach in Uganda. METHODS: This was a qualitative study conducted at Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, between April and December 2017. We conducted in-depth interviews with five pregnant or lactating women and their five male partners; five focus group discussions (two with women, two with health workers and one with male partners of women attending antenatal care) and five key informant interviews with health workers providing prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) services. Data were analysed using content thematic approach. RESULTS: There was limited awareness about HIV self-testing especially among pregnant or lactating women and their male partners. Study participants mentioned that HIV self-testing would enable people to know their HIV status faster, they thought the approach would be cost- and time-saving compared to health facility-based HIV testing, improve confidentiality and reduce stigma for those who test HIV positive. They expressed however, a general fear that HIV self-testing would lead to harm to self and others in case one tested HIV positive, including suicide, violence among couples, intentional transmission of HIV, and limited linkage to care due to lack of counselling. The likely misinterpretation of HIV test results especially among those with no or limited education, and possible coercion exerted by male partners on their wives were other potential concerns raised about the use of HIV self-testing. CONCLUSIONS: There was limited knowledge about HIV self-testing among pregnant and lactating women, their partners and health workers. While the self-testing modality was perceived to be critical for helping people, especially those in casual and distant relationships, to know their HIV status and that of their partners, most study participants believed that HIV self-testing could potentially result in a multitude of negative outcomes in the absence of pre- and post-test counselling.

In most programmes the screening and evaluation start using inhibition of virus multiplication in cell cultures, but in some instances the screening starts in animal models of different viral diseases. In these cases, the mechanism of action has to be analyzed after the in vivo effect has been found. It is not possible to specify precisely the time and resources required in a newly started project to find a compound active against a virus infection but 5-10 years is a reasonable estimation. For some viruses such as herpesviruses, where a number of active inhibitors are already known, the task is simpler than it is to find inhibitors of a virus such as influenza against which only a few active inhibitors have been reported. Evaluation of clinical efficacy in humans is a large and difficult part of the development of an antiviral drug. The number of uncontrolled clinical studies claiming efficacy of different drugs against viral diseases is depressingly large. It is essential to perform double-blind, placebo-controlled and statistically well evaluated studies to be able to judge the clinical efficacy of an antiviral drug. As the knowledge of the detailed natural history and molecular biology of viral diseases and viruses themselves increases, one will obviously have better opportunities to find new drugs. Methods such as X-ray diffraction measurement and NMR determinations will probably lead to a detailed understanding of the structures and interactions taking place at the active site of viral enzymes and their cellular counterparts.","output":"Chapter 3 Antiviral drugs: general considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acute loss of smell and taste are well-recognized symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet the correlation between self-reported and psychophysical olfactory function remains unclear. Understanding the reliability of self-reported smell loss in ambulatory cases can assess the utility of this screening measure. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study evaluating patient-reported and measured olfactory function using the validated 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) was conducted on adult outpatients with COVID-19. Patient-reported olfaction scores using a visual analog scale (VAS) were obtained at baseline, time of COVID-19 testing, and time of BSIT completion. Linear associations between VAS and BSIT were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of VAS scores were calculated. Logistic regression identified characteristics associated with accurate assessment of olfactory function. RESULTS: A total of 81 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 positive subjects, of whom 54 self-reported smell loss, were prospectively recruited &#8804;5 days from diagnosis date between May 8, 2020, and July 8, 2020. Self-reported smell loss had good discriminative ability in identifying abnormal BSIT (area under receiver operating curve [AUC] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.92). A VAS <5 demonstrated sensitivity of 0.62 and specificity of 0.94 for predicting hyposmia (BSIT &#8804;8) with accuracy of 82.7%, whereas a VAS <9 had highest sensitivity at 0.86. Moderate bivariate linear associations were found between VAS and BSIT scores (rs = 0.59, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Self-reported olfactory loss associated with COVID-19 has a strong ability to predict abnormal olfactory function though the 2 measures are moderately correlated. Subjective olfactory assessment is useful in screening olfactory dysfunction at early disease time points when psychophysical testing cannot be conducted.","output":"Association of subjective olfactory dysfunction and 12-item odor identification testing in ambulatory COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a large body of international literature on most aspects of workplace bullying, yet there are only a few research articles dealing with bullying of bosses, managers, and leaders by their subordinates and staff members.

By introducing the concept of the probability of binding efficiency (PBE) and combining the secondary structures of RNA molecules, we designed 11 siRNAs that target the consensus regions of three key viral genes: the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) genes of SARS-CoV-2. The silencing efficiencies of the siRNAs were determined in human lung and endothelial cells overexpressing these viral genes. The results suggested that most of the siRNAs could significantly reduce the expression of the viral genes with inhibition rates above 50% in 24 hours.

COVID-19 is caused by a newly emerged SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with increased pathogenicity named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the lack of understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis, an effective therapeutic option is unavailable. Epidemics described in Unani ancient literature include nazla-e-wabai and humma-e-wabai, and most of the symptoms of COVID-19 resemble nazla-e-wabai. Hence, in light of Unani literature, the treatment of COVID-19 can be managed with the composites prescribed in Unani medicine for nazla-e-wabai. In this study, a structure-based drug design approach was carried out to check the effectiveness of the pharmacologically active constituents of the Unani composites prescribed to treat nazla-e-wabai against SARS-CoV-2. We performed molecular docking of the active constituents of these composites against the main protease (Mpro), a potential drug target in SARS-CoV-2. Using detailed molecular docking analysis, Habb-ul-aas and Tabasheer were identified as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The active constituents of both these composites bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, forming interactions with key residues of the binding pocket. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation suggested the binding of active constituents of Habb-ul-aas with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a strong affinity as compared to the constituents of Tabasheer.

DESIGN Longitudinal Observational Study. SETTING Rehabilitation Department in General Hospital. POPULATION Patients showing multiple disabilities due to severe Covid 19 infection. METHODS 39 consecutive patients were admitted to a rehabilitation ward transferred from ICU or Medical wards. Barthel Index and Functional Ambulation Categories were scored as disabilities measures. Data regarding comorbidity, rehabilitation course; swabs; procedures in acute phase; nonrespiratory manifestations; dysphagia, mental confusion; PaO2/FiO2; oxygen supplementation have been collected to admission and discharge. For all patients a comprehensive rehabilitation treatment, have been provided. RESULTS Functional outcome is good with a statistical significant improvements in BI and FAC scores. 38 were discharged at their home. Mean LOS in acute wards was 46 days. Mean LOS in rehabilitation was 20 day. 11 patients still had tracheostomy at admission, none at discharge and all dysphagic patients recovered a normal oral feeding.

Testing capacity must be sufficient during the winter respiratory season when levels of cough and fever are high due to non-COVID-19 causes. This study aims to make predictions about the contribution of baseline cough or fever to future testing demand in the UK. Methods: In this analysis of the Bug Watch prospective community cohort study, we estimated the incidence of cough or fever in England in 2018-2019. We then estimated the COVID-19 diagnostic testing rates required in the UK for baseline cough or fever cases for the period July 2020-June 2021. This was explored for different rates of the population requesting tests and four second wave scenarios and then compared to current national capacity. Results: The baseline incidence of cough or fever in the UK is expected to rise rapidly from 154,554 (95%CI 103,083 - 231,725) cases per day in August 2020 to 250,708 (95%CI 181,095 - 347,080) in September, peaking at 444,660 (95%CI 353,084 - 559,988) in December.

Conclusions: Our results show that current national COVID-19 testing capacity is likely to be exceeded by demand due to baseline cough and fever alone. This study highlights that the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic must ensure that a high proportion of people with symptoms request tests, and that testing capacity is immediately scaled up to meet this high predicted demand.","output":"Impact of baseline cases of cough and fever on UK COVID-19 diagnostic testing rates: estimates from the Bug Watch community cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The use of amphetamines is a global public health concern.

Data were extracted from the electronic health record and a Research Electronic Data Capture database. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was evaluated per event stratified by race/ethnicity. Total rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and categorical patient characteristics were compared between groups using chi-square tests. RESULTS: Between June 25, 2020 and October 15, 2020, a total of 1,786 patients (57.5% Latinx, 31.2% non-Hispanic White, 5.9% non-Hispanic Black, and 5.3% non-Hispanic other) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 18 testing events.

The majority of these mutations are present in spike protein, contributing to its ability to escape the currently available neutralizing antibodies and vaccines, as well as increasing the chances of reinfection. This brief communication provides an insight into mutations detected in the omicron variant and their impact on currently available interventions against SARS-CoV-2 and the need for a booster dose.

However, it was reported in 2006 that dsRNA could be detected by immunofluorescence antibody staining in double-stranded DNA and positive-strand RNA virus infections but not in negative-strand RNA virus infections. Other reports in the literature seemed to support these observations. This suggested that negative-strand RNA viruses produce little, if any, dsRNA or that more efficient viral countermeasures to mask dsRNA are mounted. Because of our interest in the use of dsRNA antibodies for virus discovery, particularly in pathological specimens, we wanted to determine how universal immunostaining for dsRNA might be in animal virus infections. We have detected the in situ formation of dsRNA in cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus, measles virus, influenza A virus, and Nyamanini virus, which represent viruses from different negative-strand RNA virus families. dsRNA was also detected in cells infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, an ambisense RNA virus, and minute virus of mice (MVM), a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) parvovirus, but not hepatitis B virus. Although dsRNA staining was primarily observed in the cytoplasm, it was also seen in the nucleus of cells infected with influenza A virus, Nyamanini virus, and MVM. Thus, it is likely that most animal virus infections produce dsRNA species that can be detected by immunofluorescence staining. The apoptosis induced in several uninfected cell lines failed to upregulate dsRNA formation. IMPORTANCE An effective antiviral host immune response depends on recognition of viral invasion and an intact innate immune system as a first line of defense. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a viral product essential for the induction of innate immunity, leading to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and the activation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. The present study demonstrates that infections, including those by ssDNA viruses and positive- and negative-strand RNA viruses, produce dsRNAs detectable by standard immunofluorescence staining. While dsRNA staining was primarily observed in the cytoplasm, nuclear staining was also present in some RNA and DNA virus infections. The nucleus is unlikely to have pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors for dsRNA because of the presence of host dsRNA molecules. Thus, it is likely that most animal virus infections produce dsRNA species detectable by immunofluorescence staining, which may prove useful in viral discovery as well.","output":"Double-Stranded RNA Is Detected by Immunofluorescence Analysis in RNA and DNA Virus Infections, Including Those by Negative-Stranded RNA Viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, our world has been hit by a global pandemic of COVID-19, belonging to the family of Coronavirus Due to the rapid increase in the infection and the death rate, people have started to develop mixed feelings regarding this situation Therefore, in this study, our sole focus is to analyze the emotions expressed by people using social media such as Twitter etc Accumulating and studying the concerning tweets will provide aid to elicitate the real emotions during this hard time The goal of this study is to present a domain-specific approach to understand sentiments manifested within people around the globe regarding this situation In order to attain this, corona-specific tweets are acquired from twitter platform After gathering the tweets, they are labelled and a model is developed which is effective for detecting the actual sentiment behind a tweet related to COVID-19 The substantial assessments are performed in bi-class and multi-class setting over n-gram feature set along with cross-dataset evaluation of different machine learning techniques in order to develop the model Our experiments reveal that the proposed model performs well in perceiving the perception of people about COVID-19 with a maximum accuracy of about 93% ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Sentiment Identification in COVID-19 Specific Tweets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, I consider whether the critical rationalist philosophy of science may provide a rationale for trusting scientific knowledge.

Innumerable lives have been lost to this novel infectious disease, the nature of which supersedes conventional medical understanding. The COVID-19 pandemic is not just a global health crisis, several aspects of life in the post-COVID-19 era are also being contemplated. Experts in unison are warning that the upcoming changes in all areas of life could potentially be far more drastic than ever experienced in the entire human civilization. The medical community is no exception, and therefore, personnel involved in forensic medicine also need to be adequately prepared for the future. Forensic medicine is a branch of medicine dedicated to one of the most important stages of the human lifecycle and has always been at the forefront in times of unprecedented social change. The autopsy, one of the most important tools of forensic medicine, is also useful to infectious diseases because it identifies the causal relationship between death and infection, reveals medical and epidemiological knowledge, and provides objective evidence for legal disputes. We present new autopsy guidelines in forensic medicine, formulated based on the various infectious diseases that we presently live with and may encounter in the future. In formulation of these guidelines several considerations have been taken into account, namely, the role forensic pathologists should play in the post-COVID-19 era and the necessary preparations as well as the support needed from society to fulfill that role. The present COVID-19 outbreak should be a starting point for formulating improvements in current practices in forensic science, including autopsy biosafety practices and the medicolegal death investigation system.","output":"Proposal of the Autopsy Guideline for Infectious Diseases: Preparation for the Post-COVID-19 Era (abridged translation)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Potentially avoidable hospitalizations are disproportionately experienced by racial and ethnic minorities and expose these groups to unnecessary iatrogenic harm (including the risk of nosocomial COVID-19) and undue financial burden. In working toward an overarching goal of eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities, it is important to understand whether and to what extent potentially avoidable hospitalizations have changed by race and ethnicity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This single-center pre-post study included patients admitted to any UCLA Health hospital for an ambulatory care-sensitive condition between March-August 2019 (prepandemic period) and March-August 2020 (postpandemic period). Investigators measured the change in the number of potentially avoidable hospitalizations (defined per the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines) stratified by race and ethnicity and calculated the 95% CIs for these hospitalizations using a cluster bootstrap procedure. RESULTS: Between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020, 347 of 4,838 hospitalizations (7.2%) were potentially avoidable, compared with 557 of 6,248 (8.9%) during the same 6-month period in 2019. Potentially avoidable hospitalizations decreased by 50.3% (95% CI=41.2, 60.9) among non-Hispanic Whites but only by 8.0% (95% CI= -16.2, 39.9) among African Americans (50.3% vs 8.0%, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities in potentially avoidable hospitalizations increased during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large urban health system. Given that the prepandemic rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations were already higher among racial and ethnic minorities, especially among African Americans, this finding should cause alarm and lead to further exploration of the complex factors contributing to these disparities.","output":"Racial Disparities in Potentially Avoidable Hospitalizations During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aimed to provide basic data for the development of COVID-19 infection management educational programs by confirming the factors that affect the performance of COVID-19 infection management administration in general hospitals Method: Data was collected from administrative staff at 192 general hospitals by means of a structuralized questionnaire, and SPSS Ver 21 0 software was used for data analysis Conclusion: The extent of knowledge and execution of COVID-19 infection management processes by administrative staff in general hospitals was positively correlated with the extent of educational demand for COVID-19 infection management, with explanatory power of 16 7% It is necessary to include factors including COVID-19 transmission route, transmission prevention, and staff safety in COVID-19 infection management educational program administration In addition, it is essential also to performance COVID-19 infection management education","output":"Factors that affect the performance of covid-19 infection management administration in general hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the anxiety and depression in pregnant women in China, and its influencing factors during the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic METHODS: From February 22 to February 27, a questionnaire survey was conducted on 156 pregnant women, including demographic characteristics, a self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and a self-depression rating scale (SDS) RESULTS: A total of 13 non-homologous end-joining (8 3%, 13/156) patients were anxious, 79 patients (50 6%, 79/156) were depressed, and 13 patients (8 3%, 13/156) suffered from both anxiety and depression The SAS score of pregnant women was 40 55  6 09, and the SDS score was 50 42  11 64 For the SAS score, only 8 3% of all patients (13/156) were in a light anxiety state For the SDS score, 46 79% (73/156) of patients was normal, 23 72% of patients (37/156) showed mild depression, 22 44% (35/156) showed moderate depression, and 4 49% (7/156) showed severe depression No significant changes were observed in SAS and SDS scores between patients from different regions within China, health state, gestational week, educational background, and living condition (P &gt; 0 05) Moreover, no significant differences were observed between diagnosed/suspected patients and the normal control group (P &gt; 0 05), and between pregnant women in Wuhan compared to other regions (P &gt; 0 05) CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, the anxiety level of pregnant women was the same as that before the epidemic, while the level of depression was significantly higher Pregnant women who lived in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, were not more anxious or depressed compared to pregnant women in other regions during the COVID-19 epidemic Furthermore, the mental health status of pregnant women with COVID-19 was not more severe","output":"Investigation on the mental health status of pregnant women in China during the Pandemic of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This retrospective study was to investigate the association between clinical characteristics and computerized tomography (CT) findings in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

There is a paucity of population-based data on these phenomena for stroke. We examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and treatment of ischemic stroke in an entire population. Methods: We used linked provincial administrative data and data from the Quality Improvement and Clinical Research Alberta Stroke Program, a registry capturing stroke-related data on the entire population of Alberta(4.3 million), to identify all patients presenting with stroke in the pre-pandemic(1-January-2016 to 27-February-2020, n=19,531) and pandemic(28-February-2020 to 30-August-2020, n=2,255) periods. We examined changes in thrombolysis and endovascular therapy(EVT) rates, workflow, and in-hospital outcomes. Results: Hospitalizations/presentations for ischemic stroke dropped (weekly adjusted-incidence-rate-ratio[aIRR]:0.48, 95%CI:0.46-0.50, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, pre-admission care needs), as did population-level incidence of thrombolysis(aIRR:0.49,0.44-0.56) or EVT(aIRR:0.59,0.49-0.69). However, the proportions of presenting patients receiving acute therapies did not decline (e.g. thrombolysis:11.7% pre-pandemic vs 13.1% during-pandemic, aOR:1.02,0.75-1.38). Onset-to-door times were prolonged; EVT recipients experienced longer door-to-reperfusion times (median door-to-reperfusion:110-minutes, IQR:77-156 pre-pandemic vs 132.5-minutes, 99-179 during-pandemic; adjusted-coefficient:18.7-minutes, 95%CI:1.45-36.0). Hospitalizations were shorter but stroke severity and in-hospital mortality did not differ. Interpretation: The first COVID-19 wave was associated with a halving of presentations and acute therapy utilization for ischemic stroke at a population level, and greater pre-hospital and in-hospital treatment delays. Our data can inform public health messaging and stroke care in current and future waves. Messaging should encourage attendance for emergencies and stroke systems should re-examine code stroke protocols to mitigate inefficiencies.","output":"Changes in ischemic stroke presentations and associated workflow during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: A population study in Alberta, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infants usually say their first word at the age of 12 months; subsequently, within the next 6C12 months, they develop a vocabulary of approximately 50 words, along with the ability to make two-word combinations.

It is now recognized that patients may develop multisystem disease that spans multiple medical subspecialties. Here, we describe the findings from a large single center longitudinal cohort of 60 patients, the broad phenotypic presentation, as well as highlight the cohorts experience with hematopoietic cell transplantation and COVID-19. Disease manifestations could be separated into three major phenotypes: inflammatory/vascular, immune dysregulatory, and hematologic, however, most patients presented with significant overlap between these three phenotype groups. The cardinal features of the inflammatory/vascular group included cutaneous manifestations and stroke. Evidence of immune dysregulation was commonly observed, including hypogammaglobulinemia, absent to low class-switched memory B cells, and inadequate response to vaccination. Despite these findings, infectious complications were exceedingly rare in this cohort. Hematologic findings including pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), immune-mediated neutropenia, and pancytopenia were observed in half of patients. We significantly extended our experience using anti-TNF agents, with no strokes observed in 2026 patient months on TNF inhibitors. Meanwhile, hematologic and immune features had a more varied response to anti-TNF therapy. Six patients received a total of 10 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) procedures, with secondary graft failure necessitating repeat HCTs in three patients, as well as unplanned donor cell infusions to avoid graft rejection. All transplanted patients had been on anti-TNF agents prior to HCT and received varying degrees of reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative conditioning. All transplanted patients are still alive and have discontinued anti-TNF therapy. The long-term follow up afforded by this large single-center study underscores the clinical heterogeneity of DADA2 and the potential for phenotypes to evolve in any individual patient.","output":"The Spectrum of the Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2: An Observational Analysis of a 60 Patient Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A degrada??o do intestino delgado de bovinos sadios, bem como seu efeito sobre a resistncia biomecanica, n?o s?o descritos na literatura.

The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (eg, cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (eg, genetic and respiratory infections) that results in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. As the disease advances, progressive airflow limitation occurs, usually in association with pathologic changes of emphysema. This condition is called COPD. When a stable patient experiences a sudden clinical deterioration with increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and/or worsening of shortness of breath, this is referred to as an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis as long as conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to chronic bronchitis, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. METHODS: Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms cough, chronic bronchitis, and COPD. RESULTS: The most effective way to reduce or eliminate cough in patients with chronic bronchitis and persistent exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards is avoidance. Therapy with a short-acting inhaled -agonist, inhaled ipratropium bromide, and oral theophylline, and a combined regimen of inhaled long-acting -agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid may improve cough in patients with chronic bronchitis, but there is no proven benefit for the use of prophylactic antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, expectorants, postural drainage, or chest physiotherapy. For the treatment of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is evidence that inhaled bronchodilators, oral antibiotics, and oral corticosteroids (or in severe cases IV corticosteroids) are useful, but their effects on cough have not been systematically evaluated. Therapy with expectorants, postural drainage, chest physiotherapy, and theophylline is not recommended. Central cough suppressants such as codeine and dextromethorphan are recommended for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic bronchitis due to cigarette smoking or other exposures to inhaled noxious agents is one of the most common causes of chronic cough in the general population. The most effective way to eliminate cough is the avoidance of all respiratory irritants. When cough persists despite the removal of these inciting agents, there are effective agents to reduce or eliminate cough.","output":"Chronic Cough Due to Chronic Bronchitis: ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter offers a critique of animal rights approaches for their weakness in relying on the passage of laws, and in depending upon their proper administration by legal authorities to attempt the protection of animals.

Subjective childbirth experience is influenced not only by characteristics of the childbirth itself but also by maternal characteristics. A maternal characteristic that may be associated with a more positive childbirth experience is trait mindfulness. The current study aimed to assess this association and to assess whether trait mindfulness during pregnancy had a moderating role in the possible association between non-spontaneous delivery and perception of childbirth. A subsample of 486 women, participating in a longitudinal prospective cohort study (Holistic Approach to Pregnancy and the first Postpartum Year study), completed the Three Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form at 22 weeks of pregnancy. Women completed the Childbirth Perception Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale between 7 and 21 days postpartum. The mindfulness facets acting with awareness and non-reacting were significantly associated with a more positive perception of childbirth, after adjusting for covariates. Moderation analyses showed a significant interaction between acting with awareness and non-spontaneous delivery and non-judging and non-spontaneous delivery. Non-spontaneous delivery was associated with a more negative perception of childbirth for low/medium scores of acting with awareness and non-judging, but not for high scores on these mindfulness facets. Trait mindfulness during pregnancy may enhance a positive perception of childbirth. Because this is among the first studies examining the association between maternal dispositional mindfulness and perception of childbirth, future research is needed to confirm the results of the current study.","output":"Trait mindfulness during pregnancy and perception of childbirth."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines have been recently approved, and public concern regarding the risk of anaphylactic reactions arised after few cases during the first days of mass-vaccination. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been suggested as the most probable culprit agent for allergic reactions. OBJECTIVE: We describe the allergy work-up protocol implemented for the vaccination campaign in our Center, aiming to allow the greatest number of people to be vaccinated safely. METHODS: the protocol included the self-report of a history of suspected drug or vaccine allergies, and subsequent teleconsultation and allergometric tests for PEG and Polysorbate 80 (PS80). A desensitizing protocol of vaccine administration was applied to patients sensitized only to PS80, and to those with a suspect allergic reaction after the first vaccine dose. RESULTS: 10.2% (414 out of 4042) of the entire vaccine population have been screened: only one patient resulted allergic to PEG and therefore excluded from the vaccination. Another patient was sensitized to PS80 only and safely vaccinated applying the desensitizing protocol. Seven subjects without a previous history of allergic disease experienced suspect hypersensitivity reactions to the first administered dose: one of them resulted allergic to PEG and was excluded from the second dose, while the others safely completed the vaccination with the desensitizing protocol. CONCLUSION: a careful allergological risk-assessment protocol significantly reduces the number of patients who would have avoided SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for their allergies and to effectively identify and manage those rare patients with sensitization to PEGs and/or PS80.","output":"Successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allergy risk-management: the experience of a large Italian University Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Our hospital experienced a hospital shutdown and 2 week quarantine after a case of COVID-19 was diagnosed during hospitalization. We analyzed the reopening process following hospital closure and possible factors that prevented hospital spread.

RESULTS: A total of 117 hospital staff members were tested, 26 of whom were self-isolated. Of the 54 inpatients tested, 28 on the same floor, and 2 close contacts in the endoscopic room were quarantined in a single room. Finally, all quarantined hospital staff, inpatients and outpatients were tested for COVID-19 on the 14th day of close contact. The results were all negative, and the hospital work resumed completely. CONCLUSION: Although closing and isolating the hospital appeared to have played a useful role in preventing the spread of COVID-19 inside the hospital and to the local community, it is still debated whether or not the duration of hospital closure or quarantine was appropriate. The lessons from the 2-week hospital closure suggest that wearing a mask, hand hygiene and the ward environment are important factors in preventing nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19.","output":"Factors Preventing Nosocomial Outbreak Following a Single case of COVID-19 Diagnosed During Hospitalization: A Retrospective Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first human infected with the Covid-19 virus was traced to a seafood market in Wuhan, China.

To explore these questions, we implement an agent-based model within fractal cities. Cities radiate gravitational social attraction based on their Zipfian population. The probability and predictability of contagion events are analyzed by examining fractal dimensions and lacunarity. Results show that weak gravitational forces of small locations help dissipate infections across country quicker if the pathogen had originated from that location. Gravitational forces of large cities help contain infections within them if they are the starting locations for the pathogen.

METHODS: This is a multicentre cross-sectional study. From May to November 2020, through a national survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Neurology, we collected data about the presence of COVID-19 symptoms including headache and their characteristics and severity in patients with migraine treated with anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and compared them with patients with migraine not receiving this treatment. We also conducted a subanalysis of patients with COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: We recruited 300 patients with migraine: 51.7% (155/300) were taking anti-CGRP mAbs; 87.3% were women (262/300). Mean age (standard deviation) was 47.1 years (11.6).

This article reports on the factor structure and psychometric properties of this measure. METHODS: The COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Scales (CEFIS) were developed by a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team using a rapid iterative process. Data from 1805 caregivers recruited from 28 programs at 15 institutions across the United States were collected from May-September 2020. We examined the underlying structure of the CEFIS using exploratory factor analyses and its internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha). RESULTS: Participants reported a range of COVID-19-related events (M = 8.71 events of 25). On the bidirectional 4-point impact scale, mean scores were mostly above the midpoint, indicating a slightly negative impact. Cronbach's alpha was excellent for Exposure (&#945; = .80) and Impact (&#945; = .92). Factor analysis identified six factors for Exposure (COVID-19 experiences, Access to essentials, Disruptions to living conditions, Loss of income, Family caregiving and activities, and Designation as an essential worker). There were three factors for Impact (Personal well-being, Family interactions, and Distress).

Despite limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs are being tested as medication or as prophylaxis to prevent infection. Using a stochastic model of early phase infection, we evaluate the success of prophylactic treatment with different drug types to prevent viral infection. We find that there exists a critical efficacy that a treatment must reach in order to block viral establishment. Treatment by a combination of drugs reduces the critical efficacy, most effectively by the combination of a drug blocking viral entry into cells and a drug increasing viral clearance. Below the critical efficacy, the risk of infection can nonetheless be reduced. Drugs blocking viral entry into cells or enhancing viral clearance reduce the risk of infection more than drugs that reduce viral production in infected cells. The larger the initial inoculum of infectious virus, the less likely is prevention of an infection. In our model, we find that as long as the viral inoculum is smaller than 10 infectious virus particles, viral infection can be prevented almost certainly with drugs of 90% efficacy (or more). Even when a viral infection cannot be prevented, antivirals delay the time to detectable viral loads. The largest delay of viral infection is achieved by drugs reducing viral production in infected cells. A delay of virus infection flattens the within-host viral dynamic curve, possibly reducing transmission and symptom severity. Thus, antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk.","output":"Success of prophylactic antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2: Predicted critical efficacies and impact of different drug-specific mechanisms of action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV accessory protein 7a is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular domain of 81 amino acid residues.

Thus, it was pertinent to examine the pre-requisites of e-exams to promote it as a useful tool for the smooth conduct of exams in the aforesaid nations. Against such a backdrop, this study was conducted during January to March 2021 on 207 students enrolled in four universities, three situated in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, India: Delhi University (DU), Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), and one situated in Saudi Arabia, namely Saudi Electronic University (SEU). A quantitative approach was employed for the study, with the responses recorded via web questionnaires. Confirmatory -factor analysis (CFA) was applied in the study to examine whether the process of conducting online examinations is being chosen as the appropriate form of assessment, ensuring the safety and well-being of students through AMOS (version 24) software. For determining the reliability of the two latent constructs, namely \\"Perceptions of students towards E-exams (PSE)\\" and \\"Pre-requisites of E-exams (POE),\\" Cronbach's alpha was used through SPSS (version 25) software in the study, and the results reveal that the strong internal consistency exists between all the measured variables. In addition, the mean and standard deviation were used by the researchers to find out the pre-requisites of the online examination system. The participants expressed their insights on the relative benefits of online examination. Their perception was based on pedagogy, validity and reliability, affective factors, practicality, and security. From their insights, it was concluded that online examination is more advantageous than conventional paper-based exams. The outcome also applies to the authenticity of grading and the overall efficiency concerning the time, effort, and expenditure on conducting the examination. Contrarily, the participating students also recognized numerous hurdles in implementing e-exams concerning security, validity, and impartiality. The conclusion further revealed that online examination is especially relevant for formative assessment of learning instead of summative assessment, provided authenticity, security, and flexibility are used as fundamental tenants in the proper implementation of e-exams. The outcome of the present study will facilitate higher education institutions and policymakers in taking the electronic examination system to the next level.","output":"Learners' Perspective towards E-Exams during COVID-19 Outbreak: Evidence from Higher Educational Institutions of India and Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To the best of our knowledge, here, we describe the first hospital-wide outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 that occurred in Germany in April 2020.

All patients and hospital workers were screened for SARS-CoV-2 repeatedly. An infection control team on the side was installed. Strict spatial separation of patients and intensified hygiene training of healthcare workers (HCW) were initiated. By the time of reporting, 26 patients and 21 hospital workers were infected with a cluster of cases in the geriatric department. Fourteen patients developed COVID-19 consistent symptoms and five patients with severe pre-existing medical conditions died. The outbreak was successfully contained after intensified infection control measures were implemented and no further cases among patients were detected over a period of 14 days.

BACKGROUND: Deciphering the tissue and organ interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 infection can be important to discern the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the human proteinChost protein interactions in the small intestine. METHODS: Public databases and published works were used to collect data related to small intestine tissue and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We constructed a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and showed interactions of host proteins in the small intestine. Associated modules, biological processes, functional pathways, regulatory transcription factors, disease ontology categories, and possible drug candidates for therapeutic targets were identified. RESULTS: Thirteen primary protein neighbors were found for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. ACE2 and its four partners were observed in a highly clustered module; moreover, 8 host proteins belonged to this module. The protein digestion and absorption as a significant pathway was highlighted with enriched genes of ACE2, MEP1A, MEP1B, DPP4, and XPNPEP2. The HNF4A, HNF1A, and HNF1B transcription factors were found to be regulating the expression of ACE2. A significant association with 12 diseases was deciphered and 116 drug-target interactions were identified. CONCLUSION: The protein-host protein interactome revealed the important elements and interactions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the small intestine, which can be useful in clarifying the mechanisms of gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation. The results suggest that antiviral targeting of these interactions may improve the condition of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Investigating the human protein-host protein interactome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the small intestine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study aims to investigate whether maternal SARS-CoV-2 status affect placental pathology.

In this article, we assessed tests as a policy instrument and policy enactment to contain COVID-19 and potentially reduce mortalities. STUDY DESIGN: A model was devised to estimate the factors that influenced the death rate across 121 nations and by income group. RESULTS: Nations with a higher proportion of people aged 65+ years had a higher fatality rate (P = 0.00014). Delaying policy enactment led to a higher case fatality rate (P = 0.0013). A 10% delay time to act resulted in a 3.7% higher case fatality rate. This study found that delaying policies for international travel restrictions, public information campaigns, and testing policies increased the fatality rate. Tests also impacted the case fatality rate, and nations with 10% more cumulative tests per million people showed a 2.8% lower mortality rate. Citizens of nations who can access more destinations without the need to have a prior visa have a significant higher mortality rate than those who need a visa to travel abroad (P = 0.0040).

The disease has rapidly spread, causing mass hospitalization and the loss of millions of people mainly in urban areas which are hubs for contagion. At the same time, the social distancing practices required for containing the outbreak have caused an eruption of mental illnesses that include symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The severity of such mental distress is modulated by the context of media coverage and the information and guidelines from local health authorities. Different urban green infrastructures, such as gardens, parks, and green views can be important for mitigating mental distress during the pandemics. However, it is unclear whether some urban green infrastructures are more efficient than others in reducing mental distress or whether their effectiveness changes with the context. Here we assess the relative importance of different urban green infrastructures on the mental distress of residents of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We show that although urban parks and green views are important, home gardens are the most efficient in mitigating mental distress. This is likely related to the practice of self-isolation seen for the residents of Rio de Janeiro. Information on the efficiency of different urban green infrastructures in mitigating mental distress can be important to help guide programs to inform the public about the best practices for maintaining mental health during the current outbreak.

To date, two prototypical QGLMs are quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) and quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs), which approximate the target distribution in explicit and implicit ways, respectively. Despite the empirical achievements, the fundamental theory of these models remains largely obscure. To narrow this knowledge gap, here we explore the learnability of QCBMs and QGANs from the perspective of generalization when their loss is specified to be the maximum mean discrepancy. Particularly, we first analyze the generalization ability of QCBMs and identify their superiorities when the quantum devices can directly access the target distribution and the quantum kernels are employed. Next, we prove how the generalization error bound of QGANs depends on the employed Ansatz, the number of qudits, and input states. This bound can be further employed to seek potential quantum advantages in Hamiltonian learning tasks. Numerical results of QGLMs in approximating quantum states, Gaussian distribution, and ground states of parameterized Hamiltonians accord with the theoretical analysis.

While contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim to develop risk scores either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics. Instead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals. While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore, we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via simulation based on real-world mobility data. Our results show that fine-grain spatiotemporal risk scores based on high-resolution mobility data can provide useful insights and facilitate safe re-opening.","output":"Towards Accurate Spatiotemporal COVID-19 Risk Scores using High Resolution Real-World Mobility Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FilmArray RP) test is an emerging diagnostic method in fast detecting multiple respiratory pathogens; the methodology and clinical significance of FilmArray RP in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnosis were evaluated in this study.

Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics, and plausible control measures. Results: When no control interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in our case study destination country (New Zealand; NZ) was estimated to occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1000 population per week, a crew of 20, a voyage length of 10 days, 1 day of shore leave both in NZ and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combined use of a PCR test on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing, and mask use during shore leave, increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks even with crews of only 5 members.

METHODS: An online survey of 15C24-year-olds in a high deprivation region of New Zealand asked about the need for, and receipt of, sexual healthcare during lockdown. Experience of telehealth and preferences for future receipt of sexual healthcare were also explored. Social media advertising was used to recruit participants over five weeks in August and October 2020. RESULTS: The survey sample included 500 respondents comprising 58.8% females, 25.4% Mori (indigenous) ethnicity and 21.4% LGBTQI+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex +) young people. During lockdown, 22.2% of respondents reported sexual health needs (111/500), but fewer than half this group got help (45%, 50/111), believing their issue could wait, or due to barriers contacting services and lack of information about service availability. Experience of telehealth consultations (by 28/50 participants) was mostly favourable though only 46% agreed it was easier than going to the clinic. Telehealth methods were the preferred option by some participants for future receipt of sexual healthcare; but for most scenarios suggested, respondents favoured in-person clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: Young people experienced unmet need for sexual healthcare during lockdown in New Zealand, but not because services were unavailable. Findings point to the need for targeted information dissemination to young people about available services and the importance of seeking help during lockdown. More research is needed to understand the advantages and disadvantages of sexual healthcare delivered via telehealth to inform future service provision.","output":"Access to sexual healthcare during New Zealands COVID-19 lockdown: cross-sectional online survey of 15C24-year-olds in a high deprivation region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Korean national five-day residential smoking cessation program and the factors affecting the long-term smoking cessation of participants. The residential smoking cessation program (2017C2018) recruited smokers with a smoking duration  20 years and who have attempted to quit smoking more than twice and/or smokers with chronic morbidities. Participants underwent an intensive intervention, including individual psychological therapy, group therapy, medical counseling, and pharmacotherapy. The 6-month continuous abstinence rate (CAR) was assessed via self-reports, the urine cotinine levels, and/or expired-air carbon monoxide levels. Logistic regression was used to analyze the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) to assess factors related to smoking cessation. Overall, 484 participants who completed the residential program and questionnaire were evaluated. The 3- and 6-month CAR were 81.82% and 63.22%, respectively. The aOR of 6-month continuous abstinence was lower among participants with severe nicotine dependence (aOR: 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26C0.81) and higher among participants with combination therapy of varenicline with short-term nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (aOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.07C2.51), with higher self-efficacy (aOR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.15C3.37).

Antigen detection assays can generate results within 20 min and outside of laboratory settings. Yet, their diagnostic test performance in real life settings has not been determined. METHODS: The diagnostic value of the Panbio? COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), was determined in comparison to RT-qPCR (Seegene Allplex) in community-dwelling mildly symptomatic subjects in a medium (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and high endemic area (Aruba), using two concurrently obtained nasopharyngeal swabs. Findings: 1367 and 208 subjects were enrolled in Utrecht and Aruba, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, based on RT-qPCR, was 10.2% (n = 139) and 30.3% (n = 63) in Utrecht and Aruba respectively. Specificity of the Panbio? COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test was 100% (95%CI: 99.7C100%) in both settings. Test sensitivity was 72.6% (95%CI: 64.5C79.9%) in the Netherlands and 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0C89.8%) in Aruba. Probability of false negative results was associated with RT-qPCR Ct-values, but not with duration of symptoms. Restricting RT-qPCR test positivity to Ct-values <32 yielded test sensitivities of 95.2% (95%CI: 89.3C98.5%) in Utrecht and 98.0% (95%CI: 89.2C99.95%) in Aruba. INTERPRETATION: In community-dwelling subjects with mild respiratory symptoms the Panbio? COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had 100% specificity, and a sensitivity above 95% for nasopharyngeal samples when using Ct-values <32 cycles as cut-off for RT-qPCR test positivity. Considering short turnaround times, user friendliness, low costs and opportunities for decentralized testing, this test can improve our efforts to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Real-life validation of the Panbio?

Quercetin and resveratrol are two dietary polyphenols that exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and anti-insulin resistance when administered in isolation or combination (CQR). It remains unknown whether CQR reduces high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and inflammation in rats. In the current study, 46 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups, one of which was fed a normal diet (ND, 5.4% fat, w/w) and one of which was fed a HFD (45% fat, w/w) for 3 weeks. Following removal of the 12 most obesity-resistant rats from the HFD group, the remaining rats were divided into two sub-groups: A HFD group and a HFD+CQR group (administered 120 mg/kg/day resveratrol and 240 mg/kg/day quercetin). The results revealed that the HFD+CQR group had significantly lower body weights at 11 weeks compared with the HFD group and had significantly reduced visceral adipose tissue weights and adipocyte sizes. Serum lipid profiles were also significantly ameliorated in the HFD+CQR group. CQR attenuated the expression of systemic proinflammatory adipokines, including leptin, tumor necrosis factor-, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6. It also reduced the recruitment of mast cells to the epididyotic adipose tissue (EAT). Furthermore, CQR reversed the HFD-induced suppression of 5-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase 1 (AMPK1) phosphorylation and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression in EAT. In conclusion, CQR may suppress obesity and associated inflammation via the AMPK1/SIRT1 signaling pathway in rats fed a HFD.","output":"Combination treatment with quercetin and resveratrol attenuates high fat diet-induced obesity and associated inflammation in rats via the AMPK1/SIRT1 signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I examine the spillover effects across the three different long-short portfolio indices during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other pre-existing subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis-eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis-eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2). IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.","output":"Global Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Subtype with Spike Protein Mutation D614G is Shaped by Human Genomic Variations that Regulate Expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobials are frequently inappropriately prescribed for the management of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs); therefore, the frequency of antibiotic prescriptions for patients with viral URTIs was assessed in this study.

Sociodemographic, clinical (diagnostic), and pharmacological (antimicrobial) variables were assessed. Through multivariate analysis, variables associated with the use of antibiotics for viral infections were identified. A total of 341,182 patients with viral URTIs were identified. The patients, who were from 26 different departments of Colombia, had a mean age of 29.7  23.5 years and a female predominance of 58.7% (n = 200,195). The most frequent viral infections were as follows: acute rhinopharyngitis (common cold) (n = 206,211; 60.4%); unspecified acute tonsillitis (n = 27,432; 8.0%); and acute pharyngitis (n = 26,411; 7.7%).

Patients treated in Atlntico, Valle, and Risaralda departments, along with those older than 5 years, were more likely to receive antibiotics for the treatment of viral infections. Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for the management of URTIs, which is considered an inappropriate practice due to a lack of clinical benefits, increased generation of antimicrobial resistance, and a risk of adverse reactions due to the use of medications that patients do not require.

Women pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic are experiencing moderate to high levels of emotional distress, which has previously been shown to be attributable to two types of pandemic-related pregnancy stress: stress associated with feeling unprepared for birth due to the pandemic (Preparedness Stress) and stress related to fears of perinatal COVID-19 infection (Perinatal Infection Stress). Objective. Given the well-documented harms associated with elevated prenatal stress and the critical importance of developing appropriately targeted interventions, we investigated factors predictive of pandemic-related pregnancy stress. Method. Between April 25 and May 15, 2020, 4,451 pregnant women in the U.S. were recruited via social media to complete an online questionnaire that included sociodemographic, medical, and COVID-19 situational factors, as well as the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS). Binary logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for high stress. Results. Nearly 30% of participants reported high Preparedness Stress; a similar proportion reported high Perinatal Infection Stress. Abuse history, chronic illness, income loss due to the pandemic, perceived risk of having had COVID-19, alterations to prenatal appointments, high-risk pregnancy, and being a woman of color were associated with greater levels of one or both types of stress. Access to outdoor space, older age, and engagement in healthy behaviors were protective against stress. Conclusions. Practices that may alleviate pandemic-related stress such as minimizing disruptions to prenatal care, ensuring access to outdoor space, and motivating engagement in health behaviors are of vital importance. Particular attention is needed for more vulnerable populations including women of color, women with a history of abuse, and those with high-risk pregnancy.

RECENT FINDINGS A comprehensive literature search was performed in OVID Medline, OVID Embase, and clinical trial registries, for studies published between 1990 and August 2019, examining Demodex on the ocular surface. The review included primary clinical research studies and systematic reviews of primary clinical research studies, where Demodex was considered in the context of the ocular surface and/or adnexa. Studies were categorised using the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. Risk of bias assessment was performed using validated tools for studies categorised as providing Level I or II evidence. A total of 87 studies were eligible for inclusion, including two systematic reviews. Most studies (60%) were observational, describing the prevalence of ocular Demodex in different clinical populations. There was a high degree of variability in the epidemiological data derived from cross-sectional aetiology studies. There was mostly consistent evidence to support an association between ocular Demodex and chronic blepharitis. Seven diagnostic test-accuracy studies were identified, which considered a range of techniques, including slit lamp examination for cylindrical eyelash collarettes and/or eyelash manipulation techniques, light microscopic evaluation of epilated eyelashes and in vivo confocal microscopy. There is currently no accepted gold-standard diagnostic method for ocular Demodex. For intervention studies, there was one systematic review, 11 published randomised trials, six trial registry entries, and nine case series. Despite a number of recent trials, the appropriate treatment regimen for ocular Demodex (including the optimal criteria and timing of an intervention) is not clearly established.

RESULTS As mass media later wrongly presented tobacco use as a protective factor regarding COVID-19, all three patients resumed smoking. Rigorous counseling took advantage of psychotic symptoms to correct false informations and finally promote tobacco use cessation. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic might paradoxically represent a great motivational factor to quit smoking, espacially when considering patients suffering from severe mental health disorders. Beyond the terrible suffering it causes, we illustrate with a case serie that this opportunity must be exploited by mental health professionals to improve quality and life expectancy of their patients.","output":"Tobacco Use Cessation in Three Patients Suffering from Psychotic Disorders: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The European space-economy represents a complex system with a great internal heterogeneity, intensive socioeconomic interactions and differential growth trajectories among countries and regions. The present study aims to investigate the connectivity between spatial competitiveness and resilience in Europe and seeks to design an operational framework for concerted strategies of competitive and resilient regions. To assess the linkage between resilience and competitiveness, we have developed a new measure, viz. the Resilience and Competitiveness Index (RACI) as a function of two constituent sub-indices: Resilience and Competitiveness. This approach is tested on the basis of detailed data on European regions. The empirical results from 268 EU NUTS2 regions offer a solid anchor point for the proposed operational framework for concerted development strategies of competitive and resilient regions. Our research distinguishes and proposes several systematic types of concerted regional strategies according to the performance of a region measured by Resilience and Competiveness sub-indices. A key result of the study is the design of an operational constellation for strategic regional policy evaluation, with a major added value for policy- and decision-making purposes. The use of official data from Eurostat and of standard indicators in our research assures continuity and consistency with the official Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI) classification and measurement, so that policy makers are able to compare the performance of their regions over time and to develop proper concerted strategies accordingly. The clear evidence of a connectivity between regional competitiveness and resilience may help to develop a governance approach that balances competitiveness (mainly represented by productive assets) with resilience (mainly represented by sustainability and ecological awareness) and thus to deal with the complexity in socioeconomic systems.","output":"In Search of Concerted Strategies for Competitive and Resilient Regions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, cases of atypical pneumonia were diagnosed in hospital patients in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

However, a gap in academic analysis exists regarding not only the potential impacts but also the consequences of climate-induced planned relocations both in the broader context of Latin America and in the specific case of Indigenous Peoples living in that region. In addition, academia has so far underexplored the adverse impacts of managed retreat on Indigenous Peoples, such as the loss of a sense of community, culture, and traditional knowledge. Against this background, this article offers an overview on two key cases of climate-induced (planned) relocation of Indigenous Peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean (the Gunayala people in the San Bls archipelago in Panama and the case of the densely Indigenous-inhabited Mexican state of Chiapas), explores whether managed retreat has been or may become a tool or a threat, and provides a list of specific policy recommendations to be taken into consideration in similar cases.","output":"Indigenous Peoples and climate-induced relocation in Latin America and the Caribbean: managed retreat as a tool or a threat?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Content is created for a well-defined purpose, often described by a metric or signal represented in the form of structured information.

Retirement, widowhood, and increased prevalence of chronic diseases in this age group lead to a decline in social relationships, which in turn has adverse consequences on health and well-being. The coronavirus COVID-19 crisis worsened this situation, raising interest for mobile telepresence robots (MTR) that would help create, maintain, and strengthen social relationships. MTR are tools equipped with a camera, monitor, microphone, and speaker, with a body on wheels that allows for remote-controlled and sometimes autonomous movement aiming to provide easy access to assistance and networking services. We conducted a narrative review of literature describing experimental studies of MTR involving elderly people over the last 20 years, including during the COVID-19 period. The aim of this review was to examine whether MTR use was beneficial for reducing loneliness and social isolation among older adults at home and in health and care institutions and to examine the current benefits and barriers to their use and implementation. We screened 1754 references and included 24 research papers focusing on the usability, acceptability, and effectiveness of MTR. News reports on MTR use during the COVID-19 period were also examined. A qualitative, multidimensional analysis methodology inspired by a health technology assessment model was used to identify facilitating and limiting factors and investigate if and how MTR could reduce social isolation in elderly people. Reviewed studies provide encouraging evidence that MTR have potential in this regard, as experiments report positive feedback on MTR design and core functionalities. However, our analysis also points to specific technical, ergonomic, and ethical challenges that remain to be solved, highlighting the need for further multidimensional research on the design and impact of MTR interventions for older adults and building on new insights gained during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Social Telepresence Robots: A Narrative Review of Experiments Involving Older Adults before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the world has woken up to the importance of biosecurity and the need to manage international borders. Yet strong sectorial identities exist within biosecurity that are associated with specific international standards, individual economic interests, specific research communities, and unique stakeholder involvement. Despite considerable research addressing human, animal, plant, and environmental health, the science connections between these sectors remain quite limited. One Biosecurity aims to address these limitations at global, national, and local scales. It is an interdisciplinary approach to biosecurity policy and research that builds on the interconnections between human, animal, plant, and environmental health to effectively prevent and mitigate the impacts of invasive alien species. It provides an integrated perspective to address the many biosecurity risks that transcend the traditional boundaries of health, agriculture, and the environment. Individual invasive alien plant and animal species often have multiple impacts across sectors: as hosts of zoonotic parasites, vectors of pathogens, pests of agriculture or forestry, as well as threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function. It is time these risks were addressed in a systematic way. One Biosecurity is essential to address several major sociological and environmental challenges to biosecurity: climate change, increasing urbanisation, agricultural intensification, human global mobility, loss of technical capability as well as public resistance to pesticides and vaccines. One Biosecurity will require the bringing together of taxonomists, population biologists, modellers, economists, chemists, engineers, and social scientists to engage in a new agenda that is shaped by politics, legislation, and public perceptions.","output":"One Biosecurity: a unified concept to integrate human, animal, plant, and environmental health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dozens of novel cysteine proteinases have been identified in positive single-stranded RNA viruses and, for the first time, in large double-stranded DNA viruses.

Methods: Eligible studies were randomized trials evaluating the effect of remdesivir versus placebo or no treatment. We conducted searches in the special LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs regular searches in databases, trial registries, preprint servers and websites relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned, standardized form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included three randomized trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large increase in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence).

A proteomic approach using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification was conducted on the TGEV-infected ST cells. The results showed that the 4-plex iTRAQ-based quantitative approach identified 4,112 proteins, 146 of which showed significant changes in expression 48 h after infection. At 64 h post infection, 219 of these proteins showed significant change, further indicating that a larger number of proteomic changes appear to occur during the later stages of infection. Gene ontology analysis of the altered proteins showed enrichment in multiple biological processes, including cell adhesion, response to stress, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, cell motility, protein complex assembly, growth, developmental maturation, immune system process, extracellular matrix organization, locomotion, cell-cell signaling, neurological system process, and cell junction organization. Changes in the expression levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1), caspase-8, and heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90) were also verified by western blot analysis.

TB notification data from 2011 to 2020 were obtained from the surveillance reporting system of the Bureau of Epidemiology, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health. Time series and clustering patterns of the occurrence were assessed by using time series and spatial analyses. The findings indicated temporal trends and clusters of the disease occurred in the study area. More specifically, there was an overall decreasing trend, and significantly high-rate clusters were mostly along the border of neighboring countries. ABSTRACT: Tuberculosis is a leading cause of infectious disease globally, especially in developing countries. Better knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of tuberculosis burden is important for effective control programs as well as informing resource and budget allocation. Studies have demonstrated that TB exhibits highly complex dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions at different levels. In Thailand, TB research has been primarily focused on surveys and clinical aspects of the disease burden with little attention on spatiotemporal heterogeneity. This study aimed to describe temporal trends and spatial patterns of TB incidence and mortality in Thailand from 2011 to 2020. Monthly TB case and death notification data were aggregated at the provincial level. Age-standardized incidence and mortality were calculated; time series and global and local clustering analyses were performed for the whole country. There was an overall decreasing trend with seasonal peaks in the winter. There was spatial heterogeneity with disease clusters in many regions, especially along international borders, suggesting that population movement and socioeconomic variables might affect the spatiotemporal distribution in Thailand. Understanding the space-time distribution of TB is useful for planning targeted disease control program activities. This is particularly important in low- and middle-income countries including Thailand to help prioritize allocation of limited resources.","output":"Spatiotemporal Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Thailand from 2011 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study tested if prior BCG revaccination can further boost immune responses subsequently induced by an otherwise efficacious Oxford/AstraZeneca ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccine, referred to as COVISHIELDTM in India.

METHODS: Cases were collected retrospectively from multidisciplinary prostate MRI rounds from 2017 to 2020 at a single tertiary care center. Patients with suspected prostate cancer or on active surveillance were referred for consideration of TRUS/MRI-fusion biopsy based on community-read prostate MRIs. All MRIs were re-read by subspecialized abdominal radiologists and a PI-RADS score assigned. Targeted fusion and 8C12 core systematic biopsy was performed in patients with PIRADS  3 lesions. Cohen kappa values were used to quantify interobserver agreement. Positive predictive value (PPV) was used to determine accuracy of PI-RADS score for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) (ISUP Grade Group  2). RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-two lesions in 303 patients were reviewed and 252 lesions in 198 patients biopsied. The PI-RADS score was concordant in 60.5% of lesions, downgraded in 17.8%, and upgraded in 7.8%. Agreement between community and tertiary center interpretation was fair ( = 0.354), with greater agreement for PI-RADS  4 ( = 0.523) than PI-RADS  3 ( = 0.456), and peripheral zone ( = 0.419) than transition zone lesions ( = 0.251).

Many trace minerals (TM) and vitamins may need to be replenished.

Although its psychometric properties have been extensively studied, one critical piece of information that is missing from the literature is evidence of its longitudinal factorial invariance-that is, whether the RAS measures the same recovery construct across time. The authors empirically tested the longitudinal factorial invariance assumption for the RAS. METHODS Structural equation modeling was used to test the longitudinal factorial invariance of the RAS with data longitudinally obtained at three time points from 167 people with severe mental illness. RESULTS The longitudinal factorial invariance assumption was supported (i.e., configural, metric, partial scalar, factor variance and covariance invariance). CONCLUSIONS This study found empirical evidence that the RAS can measure the same recovery construct over time and thus meets one of the important prerequisites for longitudinal assessment.","output":"Assessing the Recovery Assessment Scale Across Time."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on health care systems and economies around the globe. Clinical evidences demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces detrimental levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and significant systemic organ damage. Currently, there is no definitive therapy for COVID-19 or associated complications, and with the hope of a safe and effective vaccine in the distant future, the search for an answer is paramount. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a viable option due to their immunomodulatory effects and tissue repair and regeneration abilities. Studies have demonstrated that compassionate use of MSCs can reduce symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminate fluid buildup, and act as a regenerative technique for alveolar damage; all in a safe and effective way. With multiple autologous sources available for MSCs, each with their own respective limitations, allogenic umbilical cord (UC) and/or UC-derived Wharton's jelly (WJ) seem to be best positioned source to harvest MSCs to treat COVID-19 and associated symptoms. As an allogenic source, UC is readily available, easily obtainable, and is rich in immunomodulatory and regenerative factors. In this manuscript, we reviewed the current evidences and explored the potential therapeutic use of allogenic UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. Although, preliminary preclinical and clinical studies indicate that their use is safe and potentially effective, more multi-center, randomized, controlled trials are needed to adequately assess the safety and efficacy of UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Umbilical cord: an allogenic tissue for potential treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global public health crisis unleashed by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic has made it clear that digital competence in education is no longer an option, but a necessity.

Because neural networks are opaque, certifying their correctness is a significant challenge. To address this issue, several neural network verification approaches have recently been proposed. However, these approaches afford limited scalability, and applying them to large networks can be challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework that can enhance neural network verification techniques by using over-approximation to reduce the size of the networkthus making it more amenable to verification. We perform the approximation such that if the property holds for the smaller (abstract) network, it holds for the original as well. The over-approximation may be too coarse, in which case the underlying verification tool might return a spurious counterexample. Under such conditions, we perform counterexample-guided refinement to adjust the approximation, and then repeat the process. Our approach is orthogonal to, and can be integrated with, many existing verification techniques. For evaluation purposes, we integrate it with the recently proposed Marabou framework, and observe a significant improvement in Marabous performance. Our experiments demonstrate the great potential of our approach for verifying larger neural networks.","output":"An Abstraction-Based Framework for Neural Network Verification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing the productivity of flexible working during working hours is a common concern for employers. Employees working in different sectors use various tools to carry out their tasks and work in different working environments. With the Covid-19 pandemic that began in the beginning of 2020, remote working has become an essential part of life. However, one of the biggest problems faced by managers and employers is how to control remote workers. In this study, SmartRadar software was developed to track employee computer use behavior and detect anomalous behavior. Anomalous behavior is defined as computer-based activities or processes carried out during work time which are not related to the tasks for which the employee is responsible. Clicking, mouse wheel scrolling, copying and other similar actions by the user are processed, a summary of the data is generated, and a multi-dimensional dataset is created. Anomalous behavior can then be detected using support vector machines. The proposed software has been shown to detect anomalous computer use behavior by employees with a high degree of accuracy. The favorable results of the study show that the proposed method and the software could be used for tracking and reporting purposes both in workplaces and in flexible working conditions. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.","output":"SVM-based anomaly detection in remote working: Intelligent software SmartRadar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Various studies showed the negative impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns and school closures on the well-being of children and adolescents. However, the prevalence and consequences of occasional short-term school disruptions due to COVID-19-related quarantine or isolation remain unknown. This study evaluated their impact on the well-being and stress level of children and adolescents. Methods In June/July 2021, we conducted a survey selecting a representative sample of children and adolescents of a Swiss canton population. Parents of school-aged children reported information about them missing school because of COVID-19, from August 2020 to June 2021, as well as about their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measured with the KINDL(R) scale and their stress level. Results Among the 538 participants, 216/538 (40.1%) pupils missed school at least once for COVID-19-related causes, with a total of 272 absences. We observed no relationship between the frequency of COVID-19-related absences and the HRQoL or stress level, even when stratifying by the type of absence or socio-demographic factors. Discussion Overall, these findings are reassuring in that quarantines and related school disruptions, which we know are a common and effective way of controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission, did not seem to meaningfully impact children and adolescent's wellbeing and stress. Finding the right balance between SARS-CoV-2 control and young populations' well-being is challenging, and the current results provide additional information for decision makers.","output":"COVID-19-related school disruptions and well-being of children and adolescents in Geneva"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conformational dynamics play a crucial role in protein functions. A molecular-level understanding of the conformational transition dynamics of proteins is fundamental for studying protein functions. Here, we report a study of real-time conformational dynamic interaction between calcium-activated calmodulin (CaM) and C28W peptide using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy and imaging. Plasma membrane Ca-ATPase protein interacts with CaM by its peptide segment that contains 28 amino acids (C28W). The interaction between CaM and the Ca-ATPase is essential for cell signaling. However, details about its dynamic interaction are still not clear. In our current study, we used Cyanine3 labeled CaM (N-domain) and Dylight 649 labeled C28W peptide (N-domain) to study the conformational dynamics during their interaction. In this study, the FRET can be measured when the CaM-C28W complex is formed and only be observed when such a complex is formed. By using single-molecule FRET efficiency trajectory and unique statistical approaches, we were able to observe multiple binding steps with detailed dynamic features of loosely bound and tightly bound state fluctuations. The C-domain of CaM tends to bind with C28W first with a higher affinity, followed by the binding of the CaM N-domain. Due to the comparatively high flexibility and low affinity of the N-domain and the presence of multiple anchor hydrophobic residues on the peptide, the N-domain binding may switch between selective and non-selective binding states, while the C-domain remains strongly bound with C28W. The results provide a mechanistic understanding of the CaM signaling interaction and activation of the Ca-ATPase through multiple-state binding to the C28W. The new single-molecule spectroscopic analyses demonstrated in this work can be applied for broad studies of protein functional conformation fluctuation and protein-protein interaction dynamics.","output":"Probing functional conformation-state fluctuation dynamics in recognition binding between calmodulin and target peptide."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has presented direct and indirect challenges to the scientific community. One of the most prominent indirect challenges advents from the mandatory use of face masks in a large number of countries.

It has been shown that the performance of these methods drops considerably in the presence of face masks, especially if the reference image is unmasked. We propose FocusFace, a multi-task architecture that uses contrastive learning to be able to accurately perform masked face recognition. The proposed architecture is designed to be trained from scratch or to work on top of state-of-the-art face recognition methods without sacrificing the capabilities of a existing models in conventional face recognition tasks. We also explore different approaches to design the contrastive learning module. Results are presented in terms of masked-masked (M-M) and unmasked-masked (U-M) face verification performance. For both settings, the results are on par with published methods, but for M-M specifically, the proposed method was able to outperform all the solutions that it was compared to. We further show that when using our method on top of already existing methods the training computational costs decrease significantly while retaining similar performances.

To assess local cultural attitudes towards bats for formulating a targeted conservation campaign, we conducted a survey of consumption practices of bats in 2013 at the eight major markets near Manado. Locals eat flying foxes at least once a month, but the frequency increases tenfold around Christian holidays. Approximately 500 metric tons of bats are imported from other provinces, with South Sulawesi as the main provider at 38%. No action has been taken to conserve the bats, as continued abundance in the market masks the effects of the bushmeat trade on wild populations. We suggest: (1) engaging churches as conduits for environmental education and quota enforcement; (2) legal regulation of interprovincial trade; (3) substituting bats with a sustainable option; (4) involving local students as campaigners to ensure higher receptiveness from local communities. Grassroots conservation initiatives combined with enforcement of existing laws aim to affect change on a local level, which has been successful in other conservation programs.

This is the first study to compare injury pattern during the two months lockdown period with the data of corresponding months from years 2016-2020. Also we compared the age- and sex-wise distribution patterns of these injuries for the above mentioned period. METHODS: This retrospective cross sectional study was conducted by the Department of Orthopaedics in Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH) in Faridkot, Punjab. Secondary data for patient's age and sex, mode of injury, and site of injury was collected through record review for the period of two months (24(th) March to 24(th) May) for five consecutive years of 2016-2020. Descriptive analysis and Chi-square test was used to see the association between age and sex with mode and type of injury. RESULTS: The five year injury trends reflected that the proportion of injuries in 2016 was 16.5% (n = 48) of the total musculoskeletal injuries (n = 291) which rose to 23.4% (n = 68) in 2020. Majority of the patients were males (80%), and belonged to adult age group (69.4%) followed by elderly (17.2%), adolescents (8.6%) and children (4.8%). The proportion of road traffic accidents out of all injuries significantly reduced during the lock down period of two months in 2020 (p = 0.001). On the contrary, the proportion of injuries due to falls as well as unspecified assault increased significantly in 2020 as compared to previous years. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of musculoskeletal injuries have increased from 2016-2020. Unspecified assault and all types of falls pushed the road traffic accidents to third position during the lockdown period in 2020 as compared to previous four years. Injury surveillance needs to be integrated in routine hospital system for precise information and for more efficient functioning.","output":"Comparing pattern of musculoskeletal injuries prior to and during COVID-19 lockdown: A time-trend case study from a tertiary level Trauma Center of Northern India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a promising point-of-care imaging technology for diagnosing and managing pneumonia.

The overall hypothesis of this study is that Ang-(1-7) inhibits Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), via regulation of mitogen-activated protein phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) activity. Aortas from male Wistar rats were incubated with Ang-(1-7) or vehicle. Concentration-response curves to Ang II were performed in endothelium-denuded aortas, in the presence or absence of ERK1/2 (PD98059) inhibitor or Mas receptor (A-779) antagonist. Expression of proteins was assessed by western blot, and immunohistochemistry was conducted in VSMCs. Ang-(1-7) incubation decreased Ang II-induced contractile response in aortas, and this effect was not observed in the presence of PD98059 or A-779. Stimulation of VSMCs with Ang-(1-7) prevented Ang II-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but not C-Raf-activation. Furthermore, Ang II decreased MKP-1 phosphorylation in VSMCs. Interestingly, simultaneous incubation of Ang-(1-7) with Ang II favored MKP-1 phosphorylation, negatively modulating ERK1/2 activation in VSMCs. The results suggest that Ang-(1-7) counter-regulates actions evoked by Ang II overproduction, as observed in cardiovascular diseases, mainly by modulating MKP-1 activity.

The objective of this study was to examine whether the developmental characteristics of medical workers are associated with anxiety and depression after the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: We conducted an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey in October 2020. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The data of 640 medical workers were analysed. The questionnaire included items on sociodemographic data, changes in their life after the COVID-19 outbreak and symptoms of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits and autism spectrum disorder traits. MAIN OUTCOMES: Depression symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and anxiety symptoms were assessed by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to test the effects of developmental characteristics on depression and anxiety symptoms after controlling for sociodemographic factors and changes in participants lives after the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Increases in physical and psychological burden were observed in 49.1% and 78.3% of the subjects, respectively. The results of a multiple regression analysis showed that ADHD traits were significantly associated with both depression (=0.390, p<0.001) and anxiety (=0.426, p<0.001). Autistic traits were significantly associated with depression (=0.069, p<0.05) but not anxiety. Increased physical and psychological burden, being female, medical workers other than physicians and nurses, fear of COVID-19 and experience of discrimination were also significantly associated with both depression and anxiety.

Wellbeing literacy is defined as a capability to comprehend and compose wellbeing language, across contexts, with the intention of using such language to maintain or improve the wellbeing of oneself, others or the world. Wellbeing literacy is underpinned by a capability model (i.e., what someone is able to be and do), and is based on constructivist (i.e., language shapes reality) and contextualist (i.e., words have different meanings in different contexts) epistemologies.

METHODS: The Dutch Radiological Society (NVvR) developed CO-RADS based on other efforts for standardization, such as Lung-RADS or BI-RADS. CO-RADS assesses the suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on a scale from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). The system is meant to be used in patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. The system was evaluated using 105 chest CTs of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in whom RT-PCR was performed (62 +/- 16 years, 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR). Eight observers assessed the scans using CO-RADS. Fleiss kappa was calculated, and scores of individual observers were compared to the median of the remaining seven observers. The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared to results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: There was absolute agreement among observers in 573 (68.2%) of 840 observations. Fleiss kappa was 0.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.47), with the highest kappa for CO-RADS categories 1 (0.58, 95% CI 0.54-0.62) and 5 (0.68, 95% CI 0.65-0.72). The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) for clinical diagnosis. The false negative rate for CO-RADS 1 was 9/161 (5.6%, 95% CI 1.0-10%), and the false positive rate for CO-RADS 5 was 1/286 (0.3%, 95% CI 0-1.0%).

Of these, 839 (48.2%) donors responded, their mean age was 46  12.5 years, 543 (65%) were females, and 611 (73%) were white. Ninety-two donors (11%) had symptoms suggestive of a COVID-19 infection with fever (48%) and fatigue (43%) being the most common. Among those with symptoms, 42 donors underwent testing and 16 tested positive. Testing was more common among donors with private insurance, and a positive test result was more common among young black donors. Only one donor surveyed required hospitalization and none required dialysis. Fourteen donors have recovered completely and two partially. Our survey highlights that a COVID-19 infection in former donors results in a mild disease with good recovery.

T cell responses develop early and correlate with protection but are relatively impaired in severe disease and are associated with intense activation and lymphopenia. A subset of T cells primed against seasonal coronaviruses cross reacts with SARS-CoV-2 and may contribute to clinical protection, particularly in early life. T cell memory encompasses broad recognition of viral proteins, estimated at around 30 epitopes within each individual, and seems to be well sustained so far. This breadth of recognition can limit the impact of individual viral mutations and is likely to underpin protection against severe disease from viral variants, including Omicron. Current COVID-19 vaccines elicit robust T cell responses that likely contribute to remarkable protection against hospitalization or death, and novel or heterologous regimens offer the potential to further enhance cellular responses.

RSV vaccines are currently unavailable, and children suffering from multiple reinfections by the same viral strain fail to develop protective responses. Although RSV-specific antibodies can be detected upon infection, these have limited neutralizing capacity. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are specialized in providing signals to B cells and help the production and affinity maturation of antibodies, mainly via IL-21 secretion. In this study, we asked if RSV could inhibit Tfh responses. We observed that Tfh cells fail to upregulate IL-21 production upon RSV infection. In the lungs, RSV infection downregulated the expression of IL-21/IL-21R in Tfh cells and upregulated PD-L1 expression in DCs and B cells. PD-L1 blockade during infection recovered IL-21R expression in Tfh cells and increased the secretion of IL-21 in a DC-dependent manner. IL-21 treatment decreased RSV viral load and lung inflammation, inducing the formation of tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) in the lung. It also decreased regulatory follicular T cells (Tfr), and increased Tfh cells, B cells, antibody avidity, and neutralization capacity, leading to an overall improved anti-RSV humoral response in infected mice. Passive immunization with purified IgG from IL-21 treated RSV-infected mice protected against RSV infection. Our results unveil a pathway by which RSV affects Tfh cells by increasing PD-L1 expression on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), highlighting the importance of an IL-21/ PD-L1 axis for the generation of protective responses to RSV infection.","output":"IL-21 treatment recovers follicular helper T cells and neutralizing antibody production in respiratory syncytial virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a global threat, due to its fluctuating frequency and lethality.

However, the findings remain inconclusive. Accordingly, we aimed to clarify associations of genetic variants in those genes with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using a systematic review with meta-analysis.

We look at the variation in the 7-day averages of the cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths in each city at the end of every week as a function of its total population, its urbanized area, and its average population density (the ratio of its population and its urbanized area). We find that during the last 10 weeks, the numbers have tended to converge: (1) a city with double the population of a smaller one can be expected to have 17 percent more cases per capita and 28 percent more deaths per capita than the smaller city;(2) a city with double the urbanized area of a smaller one can be expected to have 19 percent more cases per capita and 38 percent more deaths per capita than the smaller city;and, finally, (3) a city with double the population density of a smaller one can be expected to have 4.1 percent fewer cases per capita and 7.4 percent fewer deaths per capita than the smaller city.

However, recent studies provided strong supports that RNAi also plays a role in antiviral mechanism in mammalian cells. To combat RNAi-mediated antiviral responses, many viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSR) to facilitate their replication. VSRs have been widely studied for plant and insect viruses, but only a few have been defined for mammalian viruses currently. We identified a novel VSR from coronaviruses, a group of medically important mammalian viruses including Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and showed that the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of coronaviruses suppresses RNAi triggered by either short hairpin RNAs or small interfering RNAs in mammalian cells. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is closely related to SARS-CoV in the family Coronaviridae and was used as a coronavirus replication model. The replication of MHV increased when the N proteins were expressed in trans, while knockdown of Dicer1 or Ago2 transcripts facilitated the MHV replication in mammalian cells. These results support the hypothesis that RNAi is a part of the antiviral immunity responses in mammalian cells. IMPORTANCE RNAi has been well known to play important antiviral roles from plants to invertebrates. However, recent studies provided strong supports that RNAi is also involved in antiviral response in mammalian cells. An important indication for RNAi-mediated antiviral activity in mammals is the fact that a number of mammalian viruses encode potent suppressors of RNA silencing. Our results demonstrate that coronavirus N protein could function as a VSR through its double-stranded RNA binding activity. Mutational analysis of N protein allowed us to find out the critical residues for the VSR activity. Using the MHV-A59 as the coronavirus replication model, we showed that ectopic expression of SARS-CoV N protein could promote MHV replication in RNAi-active cells but not in RNAi-depleted cells. These results indicate that coronaviruses encode a VSR that functions in the replication cycle and provide further evidence to support that RNAi-mediated antiviral response exists in mammalian cells.","output":"The Nucleocapsid Protein of Coronaviruses Acts as a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing in Mammalian Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate sleep-related hypoventilation in multiple system atrophy (MSA) using polysomnography (PSG) with transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PtcCO(2)) monitoring.

Sleep-related hypoventilation disorder (SRHD) was defined according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition. RESULTS: Nine (27%) of the 34 patients met the diagnostic criteria of SRHD. Twenty-nine (85%) patients had sleep-related breathing disorders based on an ApneaCHypopnea Index of  5/h.

Eligible participants were patients who presented for outpatient STD care at the selected clinics for the first time in October 2012 were at least 18 years old, and were able to give informed consent. OUTCOME MEASURES: Untested rate, true-positive rate, false-negative rate and unreported rate of gonorrhoea, as well as reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio and true diagnosis sex ratio were calculated and used to describe the results. RESULTS: 2534 participants were enrolled in the study. The untested rate of gonorrhoea among females was significantly higher than that among males (female 88.1%, male 68.3%, p=0.001). The male-to-female sex ratios of untested rate, true-positive rate, false-negative rate and unreported rate were 1:1.3, 1.2:1, 1:1.6 and 1:1.4, respectively. The reported gonorrhoea incidence sex ratio of new diagnosed gonorrhoea was 19.8:1 (male vs female: 87/1106 vs 5/1420), while the true diagnosis sex ratio was 2.5:1 (male vs female: 161/1106 vs 84/1420). These data indicate that the sex ratio of reported gonorrhoea incidence has been overestimated by a factor of 7.9 (19.8/2.5). CONCLUSIONS: We found the current reported gonorrhoea incidence and sex ratios to be inaccurate due to underestimations of gonorrhoea incidence, especially among women.","output":"Analysis of the sex ratio of reported gonorrhoea incidence in Shenzhen, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The understanding of fossilization mechanisms at the nanoscale remains extremely challenging despite its fundamental interest and its implications for paleontology, archaeology, geoscience, and environmental and material sciences.

It is at the center of the vast majority of ancient textiles preserved under nonextreme conditions, known through extremely valuable fragments. Here we show the reconstruction of the nanoscale mechanism leading to the preservation of an exceptional collection of ancient cellulosic textiles recovered in the ancient Near East (4,000 to 5,000 years ago). We demonstrate that even the most mineralized fibers, which contain inorganic compounds throughout their histology, enclose preserved cellulosic remains in place. We evidence a process that combines the three steps of water transport of biocidal metal cations and soil solutes, degradation and loss of crystallinity of cellulosic polysaccharides, and silicification.","output":"In-place molecular preservation of cellulose in 5,000-year-old archaeological textiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: SARS-COV2 infection represents a therapeutic challenge due to the limited number of effective therapies available and due to the fact that it is not clear which host response in terms of inflammation pattern is the most predictive for an optimal (and rapid) recovery.

Murine models are commonly used to study the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, and in vitro studies using murine cells provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis observed in vivo. We used microarray analysis to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1.

During the COVID-19 surge (April C June 2020) with centralization of paediatric surgical care and risks from anaesthetics to both patients and staff a NOM pathway was used to manage clinically diagnosed appendicitis in the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children (RBHSC). METHODS: Prospective data collection was undertaken of all children (<16 years) diagnosed with appendicitis who entered the NOM pathway in RBHSC from 01/04/2020 to 30/06/2020. This was compared to a cohort from the same timeframe in 2019. Primary end-points were inpatient success rate of NOM and 30-day success rate of NOM (success defined as no appendectomy performed). RESULTS: 47 patients completed the NOM pathway, with 43% (20/47) suspected to have complicated appendicitis. The cohort was similar to that of 2019 in terms of age (p=0.1) and sex (p=0.8), but was 155% larger (42 v. 20). For those with simple appendicitis, there was a 96% (26/27) success rate of NOM on discharge, with a 93% (25/27) 30-day success rate. For complicated appendicitis, there was a 40% (8/20) success rate on discharge, with a 30% (6/20) 30-day success rate. CONCLUSION: The use of a NOM pathway for paediatric appendicitis during the COVID-19 surge in Northern Ireland was safe and effective for staff and patients. With a small sample size and restricted follow up more evidence is required to prove if this is an effective treatment modality with a return to normal theatre availability. In the interests of antibiotic stewardship we would not advocate NOM pathways utilisation by non-surgical clinicians.","output":"A surge in appendicitis: Management of paediatric appendicitis during the COVID-19 surge in the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This project's main objective is to discover which are those comorbidities that could lead to a fatal outcome in a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 in the state of Baja California through a classification algorithm using neural networks For this, a database obtained on the federal government portal by the General Directorate of Epidemiology with a cutoff date of June 8, 2020 was used Only the records of the residents of Baja California were kept and only the following data: Sex, Municipality, Date of death, Age, all those variables referring to morbidities, Result (Confirmed cases of COVID-19), ICU (If they needed to enter the intensive care unit);also, from the variable of the date also, from the date variable of death, another variable called \\"Deceased\\" was generated to categorize whether the patient died or not The resulting database was imported into the software where the model of the neural network, data preparation was performed and built the neural network model (multilayer perceptron) The dependent variable \\"Deceased\\" was selected, as variables the variables referring to the patient's comorbidities and as a covariate the variable of the scalar type Age For this model, a random partition of the data was carried out, where 70% of the data was assigned for training and the remaining 30% for tests, obtaining a success rate of 82% and an 18 % error","output":"Comorbidities in patients with COVID-19,case study:Baja California, using ANN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Japan has been recognized as having successfully controlled the spread of COVID-19 This study aims to gather insights to combat the spread of infection in our daily lives by observing our purchasing behavior We use point of sales (POS) data from supermarkets, convenience stores, home centers, drug stores, and electronics retail stores for a nationwide analysis Our analysis revealed the following First, the Japanese actively prevented the spread of infection by voluntarily wearing masks, using alcohol-based disinfectants, and gargling Second, they willingly stayed home during the semi-lockdown Third, they continued to purchase infection prevention essentials during periods of both low and high levels of infection We conclude that continuing to wear masks, wash and sanitize hands, and gargle, along with spending more time at home to maintain safe distancing, will be effective in reducing the spread of the virus and combatting the pandemic Finally, infections and deaths were primarily concentrated in the Tokyo metropolitan area and the Kansai region, where the nature of the spread of the infection was different from that in small and middle-sized prefectures","output":"How Did Japan Cope with COVID-19?

METHODS: To meet the objectives of the research survey, the method of questioning - an online questionnaire - was chosen. The total number of the university students who were addressed was 1164 first-year students from all seven faculties of VSB - Technical University of Ostrava (hereinafter referred to as VSB-TUO) answered. The questionnaires were subjected to the statistical classification of the first-level data. Another method was the comparative method of working with documents, comparing with the results of comparable questionnaire surveys from 2015 and 2018, and relevant scientific discussion in this context. RESULTS: The results of the research confirmed that first-year students of all VSB-TUO faculties, who as graduates of the relevant secondary school could no longer complete the subject Physical Education due to pandemic measures, preferred unorganized physical activities in accordance with the situation, such as walks, including walking the dog. 34.8% of respondents answered that they \\"did not miss sport\\" or that they \\"were not interested in sport at all\\". A high percentage of respondents (44.3%) admitted that they \\"did not miss\\" organized Physical Education lessons \\"at all\\", while some (31.3%) stated that thanks to the subject Physical Education, they were able to play sports \\"at least once a week\\". CONCLUSION: Due to the high number of interviewed first-year students of VSB-TUO, it can be assumed that we would reach similar results in a vast population of peers, and the findings can be generalized. The study summarizes the latest reflections on impersonal forms of the teaching of Physical Education on the motivation and intensity of sports and physical activities within the general level of foreign surveys as well.

In order to identify mechanisms underpinning microbiota interactions with host immune and metabolic systems that influence coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, we performed a multi-omics analysis on hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compared those with the most severe outcome (i.e. death, n = 41) to those with severe non-fatal disease (n = 89), or mild/moderate disease (n = 42), that recovered. A distinct subset of 8 cytokines (e.g. TSLP) and 140 metabolites (e.g. quinolinate) in sera identified those with a fatal outcome to infection. In addition, elevated levels of multiple pathobionts and lower levels of protective or anti-inflammatory microbes were observed in the fecal microbiome of those with the poorest clinical outcomes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified modules that associated severity-associated cytokines with tryptophan metabolism, coagulation-linked fibrinopeptides, and bile acids with multiple pathobionts, such as Enterococcus. In contrast, less severe clinical outcomes are associated with clusters of anti-inflammatory microbes such as Bifidobacterium or Ruminococcus, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and IL-17A.

Therefore, DSF represents a promising therapeutic for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional glycoprotein with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities that acts by neutralizing circulating endotoxins and activating cellular responses. In addition, LF has been well exploited as a drug nanocarrier and targeting ligands. In this study, we developed a DSF-LF nanoparticulate system (DSF-LF NP) for combining the immunosuppressive activities of both DSF and LF. DSF-LF NPs could effectively block pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release from macrophages. Treatment with DSF-LF NPs showed remarkable therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. In addition, this therapeutic strategy was also applied to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), and substantial treatment efficacy was achieved in a murine colitis model. The underlying mode of action of these DSF-LF-NPs may contribute to efficiently suppressing macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses and ameliorating the complications caused by sepsis and UC.

Methods Assumption-free k-nearest neighbour clustering from the principal component analysis of weekly incidence rates of German counties groups similar spreading behaviour. Different spreading dynamics was analysed by the derivative plots of the temporal evolution of tuples [x(t),x(t)] of weekly incidence rates and their derivatives. The effectiveness of the different shutdown measures in Germany during the second wave is assessed by the difference of weekly incidences before and after the respective time periods. Findings The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions of different extents resulted in four distinct time periods of complex, spatially diverse, and age-related spreading patterns during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Clustering gave three regions of coincident spreading characteristics. October 2020 showed a nationwide exponential growth of weekly incidence rates with a doubling time of 10 days. A partial shutdown during November 2020 decreased the overall infection rates by 20C40% with a plateau-like behaviour in northern and southwestern Germany. The eastern parts exhibited a further near-linear growth by 30C80%. Allover the incidence rates among people above 60 years still increased by 15C35% during partial shutdown measures. Only an extended shutdown led to a substantial decrease in incidence rates. These measures decreased the numbers among all age groups and in all regions by 15C45%. This decline until January 2021 was about -1?25 times the October 2020 growth rates with a strong correlation of -0?96. Interpretation Three regional groups with different dynamics and different degrees of effectiveness of the applied measures were identified.

However, systemic administration of higher dosages of doxorubicin is hampered by its toxic side effects. In this study, we aim to increase doxorubicin deposition in the primary breast tumour without changing systemic doxorubicin concentration and thus without interfering with systemic efficacy and toxicity. This is to be achieved by combining Lyso-Thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin (LTLD, ThermoDox, Celsion Corporation, Lawrenceville, NJ, USA) with mild local hyperthermia, induced by Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU). When heated above 39.5C, LTLD releases a high concentration of doxorubicin intravascularly within seconds. In the absence of hyperthermia, LTLD leads to a similar biodistribution and antitumour efficacy compared with conventional doxorubicin. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-arm phase I study in 12 chemotherapy-na?ve patients with de novo stage IV HER2-negative breast cancer. Previous endocrine treatment is allowed. Study treatment consists of up to six cycles of LTLD at 21-day intervals, administered during MR-HIFU-induced hyperthermia to the primary tumour. We will aim for 60 min of hyperthermia at 40C-42C using a dedicated MR-HIFU breast system (Profound Medical, Mississauga, Canada). Afterwards, intravenous cyclophosphamide will be administered. Primary endpoints are safety, tolerability and feasibility.

This method provides fast and efficient results, facilitating scaling up to large numbers of isolates to measure their ability to form biofilms, where lower-throughput approaches can then be utilized to further characterize isolates of interest.","output":"High-Throughput Screening of Biofilm Formation of Listeria monocytogenes on Stainless Steel Coupons Using a 96-Well Plate Format"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a worldwide crisis in public health It is crucial we understand the epidemiological trends and impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), such as lockdowns for effective management of the disease and control of its spread We develop and validate a novel intelligent computational model to predict epidemiological trends of COVID-19, with the model parameters enabling an evaluation of the impact of NPIs By representing the number of daily confirmed cases (NDCC) as a time-series, we assume that, with or without NPIs, the pattern of the pandemic satisfies a series of Gaussian distributions according to the central limit theorem The underlying pandemic trend is first extracted using a singular spectral analysis (SSA) technique, which decomposes the NDCC time series into the sum of a small number of independent and interpretable components such as a slow varying trend, oscillatory components and structureless noise We then use a mixture of Gaussian fitting (GF) to derive a novel predictive model for the SSA extracted NDCC incidence trend, with the overall model termed SSA-GF Our proposed model is shown to accurately predict the NDCC trend, peak daily cases, the length of the pandemic period, the total confirmed cases and the associated dates of the turning points on the cumulated NDCC curve Further, the three key model parameters, specifically, the amplitude (alpha), mean (mu), and standard deviation (sigma) are linked to the underlying pandemic patterns, and enable a directly interpretable evaluation of the impact of NPIs, such as strict lockdowns and travel restrictions The predictive model is validated using available data from China and South Korea, and new predictions are made, partially requiring future validation, for the cases of Italy, Spain, the UK and the USA Comparative results demonstrate that the introduction of consistent control measures across countries can lead to development of similar parametric models, reflected in particular by relative variations in their underlying sigma, alpha and mu values The paper concludes with a number of open questions and outlines future research directions","output":"Derivation and validation of a novel intelligent computational approach to model epidemiological trends and assess the impact of non-pharmacological interventions for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the progress of medical technology, biomedical field ushered in the era of big data, based on which and driven by artificial intelligence technology, computational medicine has emerged.

Traditionally, the machine learning methods are used to dig out biomedical data to find the features from data, which generally rely on feature engineering and domain knowledge of experts, requiring tremendous time and human resources. Different from traditional approaches, deep learning, as a cutting-edge machine learning branch, can automatically learn complex and robust feature from raw data without the need for feature engineering. The applications of deep learning in medical image, electronic health record, genomics, and drug development are studied, where the suggestion is that deep learning has obvious advantage in making full use of biomedical data and improving medical health level. Deep learning plays an increasingly important role in the field of medical health and has a broad prospect of application. However, the problems and challenges of deep learning in computational medical health still exist, including insufficient data, interpretability, data privacy, and heterogeneity.

Herein, an antifouling electrochemical biosensor was constructed based on electropolymerized polyaniline (PANI) nanowires and newly designed peptides for the detection of the COVID-19 N-gene. The inverted Y-shaped peptides were designed with excellent antifouling properties and two anchoring branches, and their antifouling performances against proteins and complex biological media were investigated using different approaches. Based on the biotin-streptavidin affinity system, biotin-labeled probes specific to the N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of COVID-19 were immobilized onto the peptide-coated PANI nanowires, forming a highly sensitive and antifouling electrochemical sensing interface for the detection of COVID-19 nucleic acid. The antifouling genosensor demonstrated a wide linear range (10-14 to 10-9 M) and an exceptional low detection limit (3.5 fM). The remarkable performance of the genosensor derives from the high peak current of PANI, which is chosen as the sensing signal, and the extraordinary antifouling properties of designed peptides, which guarantee accurate detection in complex systems. These crucial features represent essential elements for future rapid and decentralized clinical testing.","output":"Electrochemical Biosensor with Enhanced Antifouling Capability for COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Detection in Complex Biological Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The foodservice industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world and it contributes to the development of the Vietnamese economy.

Traditional BP measurement methods are based on a cuff, which is bulky, obtrusive and not applicable to continuous monitoring. Measurement of pulse transit time (PTT) is one of the prominent cuffless methods for continuous BP monitoring. PTT is the time taken by the pressure pulse to travel between two points in an arterial vessel which is correlated with the BP. In this paper, we present a new cuffless BP method using an array of wrist-worn bio-impedance sensors placed on the radial and the ulnar arteries of the wrist to monitor the arterial pressure pulse from the blood volume changes at each sensor site. BP was accurately estimated by using AdaBoost regression model based on selected arterial pressure pulse features such as transit time, amplitude and slope of the pressure pulse which are dependent on the cardiac activity and the vascular properties of the wrist arteries. A separate model was developed for each subject based on calibration data to capture the individual variations of BP parameters. In this pilot study, data was collected from 10 healthy participants with age ranges from 18 to 30 years after exercising using our custom low-noise bio-impedance sensing hardware. Post-exercise BP was accurately estimated with an average correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.77 and 2.6 mmHg for the diastolic BP and 0.86 and 3.4 mmHg for the systolic BP.","output":"Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring from an Array of Wrist Bio-impedance Sensors using Subject-Specific Regression Models: Proof of Concept."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Integration is an important, albeit difficult, goal of science and mathematics education.

The framework is organized in three levels of integration, based on current research, and detailed with specific integration indicators about an exemplary PBL activity, named STEM Bees. This PBL activity was structured as a research problem divided into two integrated problems. A qualitative methodology was used, focused on the application of the framework to the work of PSTs in that PBL activity. The final participants were 13 PSTs, organized in four working groups. In general, results show that PSTs integration performance was higher with the second problem than with the first problem. However, full integration with meaningful connections between science and mathematics ideas was achieved by almost all PST at the conclusion of the research problem. The IPoSM framework indicators proved to be useful for identifying the level of integration of science and mathematics in PSTs work in each phase of the PBL activity.

Screening is currently dependent on interpretation of images captured by trained technicians. Inherent barriers of accessibility and affordability with this approach impedes widespread success of retinopathy screening programs. Herein, we report our observations on the potential of a novel approach, Selfie Fundus Imaging (SFI), to enhance retinopathy screening.Methods: The study was undertaken over a two-month period during COVID 19 lockdown. 60 diabetic patients participated in the study. Retinal images were captured using three different approaches, handheld smartphone based photographs captured by patients themselves after a short video assisted training session (SFI group), smartphone based photographs captured by a trained technician and photographs taken on desktop conventional digital fundus camera (Gold standard). Sensitivity and kappa statistics was determined for retinopathy and macular edema grading.Findings: Mean age of the study participants was 52.4 years +/- 9.8 years and 78% were men. Of 120 images captured using SFI, 90% were centred-gradable, 8% were decentred-gradable and 2% were ungradable. 82% patients captured the image within a minute (majority by 31-45 seconds). The sensitivity of SFI to detect diabetic retinopathy was 88.39%. Agreement between SFI grading and standard fundus photograph grading was 85.86% with substantial kappa (0.77). For the detection of diabetic macular edema, the agreement between SFI images and standard images was 93.67, with almost perfect kappa (0.91).Interpretation: Fundus images were captured by patients using SFI without major difficulty and were comparable to images taken by trained specialist. With greater penetrance, advances, and availability of mobile photographic technology, we believe that SFI would positively impact success of diabetic retinopathy screening programs by breaking the barriers of availability, accessibility, and affordability. SFI could ensure continuation of screening schedules for diabetic retinopathy, even in the face a highly contagious pandemic.Funding: The study was not funded by any intramural or extramural agencies/ companies/ sponsors. It was carried out independently by the authors without seeking any funding.Conflict of Interest: None to declare.

AIMS This study investigated cultural differences in the effects of expressive suppression, whilst watching a traumatic film, on subjective distress, psychophysiological responses and intrusive memory. METHOD Australians of European heritage or East Asian Australian participants (n = 82) were randomly assigned to either a suppression group (instructed to suppress their emotions during the film) or a control group (no instructions regarding emotion management). Electrodermal activity, heart rate and heart rate variability (root mean square of the successive differences; RMSSD) were measured pre-, during and post-film. Participants reported the number of film-related intrusions in the 5 min and 7 days post-viewing. RESULTS While the European Australian group did not differ significantly on RMSSD, the East Asian suppression group scored significantly higher on RMSSD during the film than the East Asian control group. Second, those in the suppression groups, regardless of cultural background, reported significantly fewer intrusions immediately post-film than controls. Third, we found that for the European Australian group, change in heart rate interacted with group (control versus suppression) when predicting weekly intrusions. However, for the East Asian group change in heart rate did not interact with group when predicting weekly intrusions.

The pathogenesis of MS is believed to be due to an immunologic response in a genetically predisposed individual, localized within the central nervous system white matter, and triggered by exposure to an environmental agent such as a virus. Based on our personal experience we find that the efficacy of IFN therapy is hampered in MS patients by the presence of an interferon inhibitor factor (IIF) in the patients' sera which we have isolated and characterized. When plasmapheresis (PP) was done on 24 MS patients with intermittent 3\\\\day administration of IFN\\\\a and human leukocyte IFN, marked increase of IFN in 18 patients and modest increase in three patients correlated with clinical improvement. Three clinical nonresponders showed no increase in IFN levels following therapy.

METHOD: The NNN includes four clinical research sites (Emory University; Medical College of Wisconsin; University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); University of Florida) and Pearson Clinical Assessment. Pearson Q-interactive (Q-i) is used for data capture for Pearson published tests; web-based data capture tools programmed by UCLA, which serves as the Coordinating Center, are employed for remaining measures. RESULTS: NNN is acquiring item-level data from 500-10,000 patients across 47 widely used Neuropsychology (NP) tests and sharing these data via the NIMH Data Archive. Modern psychometric methods (e.g., item response theory) will specify the constructs measured by different tests and determine their positive/negative predictive power regarding diagnostic outcomes and relationships to other clinical, historical, and demographic factors. The Structured History Protocol for NP (SHiP-NP) helps standardize acquisition of relevant history and self-report data. CONCLUSIONS: NNN is a proof-of-principle collaboration: by addressing logistical challenges, NNN aims to engage other clinics to create a national and ultimately an international network. The mature NNN will provide mechanisms for data aggregation enabling shared analysis and collaborative research.

METHODS: We gathered a cohort of 29 infected pregnant mothers who delivered 32 newborns, and had placentas available for pathologic examination. Placentas were compared with a control group. RESULTS: Of the 29 mothers, clinical and radiological features were similar to what was already described in COVID-19. Pregnancy modified some analytical parameters. One of the mothers succumbed to the disease. Of the 32 newborns, 1 developed an early infection, with positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at 48 h of life, with an initial RT-PCR negative. SARS-CoV-2 presence was assessed on placental tissue with immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, both were negative. All newborns had good clinical outcomes. No differences in morphological placental findings were found among both groups. CONCLUSION: Lack of statistically significant differences among case and control groups suggest that placentas from SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers represent a cohort of normal placentas only submitted because of maternal SARS-CoV-2 status.

The first constraint is that, although QDs (=nodes) are randomly distributed in a metric space, they have to fulfill the condition that there is a minimum inter-dot distance that cannot be violated (to minimize electron localization). The second constraint arises from our process of weighted link formation, which is consistent with the laws of quantum physics and statistics: it not only takes into account the overlap integrals but also Boltzmann factors to include the fact that an electron can hop from one QD to another with a different energy level. Boltzmann factors and coherence naturally arise from the Lindblad master equation. The weighted adjacency matrix leads to a Laplacian matrix and a time evolution operator that allows the computation of the electron probability distribution and quantum transport efficiency. The results suggest that there is an optimal inter-dot distance that helps reduce electron localization in QD clusters and make the wave function better extended.

We compared the numbers of medical visits performed, antiretroviral drugs dispensed and the number of new HIV diagnosis and of hospitalizations in a cohort of people living with HIV (PLWH) followed by the Spedali Civili of Brescia between the bimester of the COVID-19 pandemic peak and the bimester of OctoberCNovember 2019. Data were retrieved from administrative files and from paper and electronic clinical charts. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were described using mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. Means for continuous variables were compared using Students t-tests and the MannCWhitney test. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the (2) test. RESULTS: As of December 31st, 2019, a total of 3875 PLWH were followed in our clinic. Mean age was 51.4  13 years old, where 28% were females and 18.8% non-Italian. Overall, 98.9% were on ART (n = 3834), 93% were viro-suppressed. A total of 1217 and 1162 patients had their visit scheduled at our out-patient HIV clinic during the two bimesters of 2019 and 2020, respectively. Comparing the two periods, we observed a raise of missed visits from 5 to 8% (p < 0.01), a reduction in the number of new HIV diagnosis from 6.4 in 2019 to 2.5 per month in 2020 (p = 0.01), a drop in ART dispensation and an increase of hospitalized HIV patients due to COVID-19.

Common pathogens, including Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are prevalent in healthcare settings and have few effective treatment options due to high rates of antibacterial resistance. Resistant pathogens are associated with significantly worse outcomes, relative to patients with susceptible infections. Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) has established efficacy in clinical trials of patients with NP. This review aims to collate data on C/T use for HABP/vHABP/VABP infections in real-world clinical practice. METHODS: This systematic literature review searched online biomedical databases for real-world studies of C/T used to treat Gram-negative respiratory tract infections (RTIs) between January 2009 and June 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies comprising 658 patients were identified. Pneumonia was the most common infection treated with C/T (85%), with a smaller number of unspecified RTIs (9%) and tracheobronchitis (5%) reported. The majority of patients had respiratory infections caused by P. aeruginosa (92.8%), of which 88.1% were multidrug-resistant. Examination of these studies demonstrated an increase in the percentage of patients receiving the recommended dose of C/T for respiratory infections (3 g q8h or renal impairment-adjusted) over time (36.8% of patients in 2017 to 71.5% in 2020). Clinical success rates ranged from 51.4 to 100%, with 10 studies (55.6% of studies reporting clinical success) reporting clinical success rates of > 70%; microbiological success rates ranged from 57.0 to 100.0%, with three studies (60.0% of studies reporting microbiological success) reporting microbiological success rates of > 70%. Thirty-day mortality ranged from 0.0 to 33.0%, with nine studies (90% of studies reporting mortality) reporting 30-day mortality of < 30%. CONCLUSIONS: The studies identified in this review demonstrate that C/T shows similar outcomes as those seen in clinical trials, despite the higher frequency of multidrug-resistant pathogens, and comorbidities that may have been excluded from the trials.

Potential use of sweet basils in COVID 19 prevention and management is making its demand rise. This study is aimed at germination potential enhancement of sweet basil seeds. Reported study is evidenced with scientific data of radio-frequency cold plasma treatment using Ar + O2 feed gas. O. basilicum seeds, placed inside the rotating glass bottle, were directly exposed to RF (13.56 MHz) plasma produced in Ar + O2 feed gas. Seed treatment was done using RF source power (60 W, 150 W, 240 W), process pressure (0.2 mbar, 0.4 mbar, 0.6 mbar), and treatment time (5 min, 10 min, 15 min) at different combinations. Results show that, the most efficient treatment provide up to 89% of the germination percentage which is an enhancement by 32.3% from the control. SEM images revealed slight shrinkage in the seed size with eroded appearance over the seed. Enhancement of lipid peroxidation, show that oxidation of seed coat may propagate internally. Water imbibition analysis, of the treated seeds, was carried out for 2-12 hours. Further analysis of seed weight, on every one hour, after soaking shows enhanced water absorption capability except the treatment at 240 W, 0.6 mbar and 15 minutes. Plasma treatment enhanced carbohydrate content and protein content which is reported to be due to increased primary metabolism. Whereas, increased activity of secondary metabolism results in the enhancement of enzymatic (catalase) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (proline). Vital growth parameters, such as SVI I and SVI II, got amplified by 37% and 133% respectively after treatment. Ameliorative effects of plasma treatment are found highly significant with a positive and significant correlation value (p < 0.01) between germination percentages, SVI I, SVI II, carbohydrate, protein and proline show their interrelationship. Ar + O2 plasma treatment is found to bring forth significant changes in the O. basilicum seeds which eventually enhanced the germination potential and it could be a very promising technology for the medicinal crop.","output":"Radio-frequency (RF) room temperature plasma treatment of sweet basil seeds (Ocimum basilicum L.) for germination potential enhancement by immaculation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With medical progress in cancer therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) became a standard of care for many cancer types.

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the struggle to contain the outbreak and push back new infection figures will ultimately be won by training citizens how to avoid creating secondary transmission chains. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the relationship between individual behaviour and group risk. Mass training of all social strata of a countrys entire population is therefore critical in mitigating the pandemic. The authors of this article argue that adult learning and education (ALE) can play a pivotal role particularly in countries where average literacy levels are low, as these are usually the same countries in which healthcare systems are more fragile. This article explains why ALE, especially the promotion of health literacy as part of ALE (which is itself part of lifelong learning), is necessary to enable individuals to make informed health-related decisions. Research has shown that low- or non-literate individuals are less responsive to health education, less likely to use disease prevention services, and less likely to successfully manage chronic disease than literate citizens. The authors refer to the evaluation of the health literacy aspect of a large-scale adult literacy campaign launched in South Africa in 2008 which has yielded measurable outcomes and proved that the intervention had enabled adults to better understand health messages. They stress the importance of populations having at least a basic level of literacy and numeracy skills to enable them to receive and act on vital information during a pandemic or disaster. They argue that ALE should in fact be understood as an inherent element of every national emergency strategy, both in terms of prior preparation for possible future emergencies (such as pandemics, earthquakes, tornados, flooding, bushfires etc.), and in terms of reaction to a given emergency such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Adult learning and education as a tool to contain pandemics: The COVID-19 experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a worldwide crisis in public health. It is crucial we understand the epidemiological trends and impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), such as lockdowns for effective management of the disease and control of its spread. We develop and validate a novel intelligent computational model to predict epidemiological trends of COVID-19, with the model parameters enabling an evaluation of the impact of NPIs. By representing the number of daily confirmed cases (NDCC) as a time-series, we assume that, with or without NPIs, the pattern of the pandemic satisfies a series of Gaussian distributions according to the central limit theorem. The underlying pandemic trend is first extracted using a singular spectral analysis (SSA) technique, which decomposes the NDCC time series into the sum of a small number of independent and interpretable components such as a slow varying trend, oscillatory components and structureless noise. We then use a mixture of Gaussian fitting (GF) to derive a novel predictive model for the SSA extracted NDCC incidence trend, with the overall model termed SSA-GF. Our proposed model is shown to accurately predict the NDCC trend, peak daily cases, the length of the pandemic period, the total confirmed cases and the associated dates of the turning points on the cumulated NDCC curve. Further, the three key model parameters, specifically, the amplitude (alpha), mean (mu), and standard deviation (sigma) are linked to the underlying pandemic patterns, and enable a directly interpretable evaluation of the impact of NPIs, such as strict lockdowns and travel restrictions. The predictive model is validated using available data from China and South Korea, and new predictions are made, partially requiring future validation, for the cases of Italy, Spain, the UK and the USA. Comparative results demonstrate that the introduction of consistent control measures across countries can lead to development of similar parametric models, reflected in particular by relative variations in their underlying sigma, alpha and mu values.

This may be due to direct effects of nutrients on immune cell function. Diet may also affect the composition and function of gut microbiota, which consequently affects immunity. In animal models of inflammatory disease, diet may modulate inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and in other peripheral sites. Despite limitations of animal models, there is now emerging evidence to show that anti-inflammatory effects of diet may translate to human gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases.

We evaluated pattern and effects of corticosteroid use in these patients during an early surge of the pandemic. METHODS Observational study of 136 SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to the Intensive care Unit between March 1 and April 27, 2020 at a tertiary care hospital in Indianapolis, USA. Statistical comparison between cohorts and dosing pattern analysis was done. Outcome measures included number of patients requiring intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay and inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Of 136 patients, 72 (53%) received corticosteroids. Groups demographics: Age (60.5 vs. 65; p .083), sex (47% male vs. 39% female; p .338) and comorbidities were similar. Corticosteroid group had increased severity of illness: PaO2/FiO2 (113 vs. 130; p .014) and SOFA (8 vs. 5.5; p < .001). Overall mortality (21% vs. 30%; p .234) or proportion of patients intubated (78 vs. 64%; p .078) was similar. Mortality was similar among mechanically ventilated (27% vs. 15%; p .151) however there were no deaths among patients who were not mechanically ventilated and received corticosteroids (0% vs. 57%; p <.001).

Excessive alcohol use is linked to an increased risk of infections including pneumococcal pneumonia, mostly commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, pneumonia patients with prior alcohol use often require more intensive treatment and longer hospital stays due to complications of infection. The initial respiratory tract immune response to S. pneumoniae includes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by resident cells in the upper and lower airways which activate and recruit leukocytes to the site of infection. However, this inflammation must be tightly regulated to avoid accumulation of toxic by-products and subsequent tissue damage. A majority of previous work on alcohol and pneumonia involve animal models utilizing high concentrations of ethanol or chronic exposure and offer conflicting results about how ethanol alters immunity to pathogens. Further, animal models often employ a high bacterial inoculum which may overwhelm the immune system and obscure results, limiting their applicability to the course of human infection. Here, we sought to determine how a more moderate ethanol exposure paradigm affects respiratory function and innate immunity in mice after intranasal infection with 10(4) colony forming units of S. pneumoniae. Ethanol-exposed mice displayed respiratory dysfunction and impaired bacterial clearance after infection compared to their vehicle-exposed counterparts. This altered response was associated with increased gene expression of neutrophil chemokines Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 in whole lung homogenates, elevated concentrations of circulating granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and higher neutrophil numbers in the lung 24 hours after infection. Taken together, these findings suggest that even a more moderate ethanol consumption pattern can dramatically modulate the innate immune response to S. pneumoniae after only 3 days of ethanol exposure and provide insight into possible mechanisms related to the compromised respiratory immunity seen in alcohol consumers with pneumonia.","output":"Ethanol Intoxication Impairs Respiratory Function and Bacterial Clearance and Is Associated With Neutrophil Accumulation in the Lung After Streptococcus pneumoniae Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The occurrence of the COVID-19 Pandemic has revealed all the weaknesses of different organisations, including macrostructures C the States It turned out that they are unprepared to COVID-19 Pandemic and at the same time pretending that they are controlling unpredictability, which is not valid I collect information through a review of secondary data and observation of pandemic effects in several countries In all countries, the effects of a pandemic are noticeable It creates the slowdown of the economy and the introduction of restrictions on public life on an unprecedented scale The effects of current economic restrictions will appear in a few months I identified weaknesses in the crisis response and argue that any organisations also in macro-level should redefine the role of crisis management, which is in crisis There is a need for a co\\\\evolving this system within the organisation, which means the necessity of reshaping crisis management from crisis management relational model into crisis management three-dimensional flexible model Crisis management based on risk analysis may be useless in the context of organisational unpredictability","output":"After COVID-19.

METHODS Data of 198 patients (280 HCC lesions), who underwent TLI plus computed tomography (CT)-guided thermal ablation at three separate medical institutions between June 2014 and September 2020, were reviewed and analyzed. The Lipiodol retention pattern was classified as complete or incomplete based on non-enhanced CT at the time of ablation. The primary outcome was local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) for lesions; the secondary outcome was overall survival (OS) for patients. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed using a caliper width of 0.1 between the two groups. Differences in LRFS and OS between the two groups were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS A total of 133 lesions exhibited a complete Lipiodol retention pattern, while 147 exhibited an incomplete pattern. After PSM analysis of baseline characteristics of the lesions, 121 pairs of lesions were matched. LRFS was significantly longer for lesions exhibiting complete retention than for those exhibiting incomplete retention (P = 0.030). After PSM analysis of patient baseline characteristics, 74 pairs of patients were matched. There was no significant difference in OS between the two groups (P = 0.456).

Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity. METHODS: Healthcare workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16-21 weeks. Serological analysis (n =12,990) was performed using semi-quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to pseudovirus neutralizing antibody measurements. FINDINGS: A total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r = 0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti-S1 measurements correlated with near-contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16-18 weeks, r = 0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks' follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti-S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative. Mathematical modelling revealed faster clearance of anti-S1 compared to anti-NP (median half-life of 2.5 weeks versus 4.0 weeks), earlier transition to lower levels of antibody production (median of 8 versus 13 weeks), and greater reductions in relative antibody production rate after the transition (median of 35% versus 50%). INTERPRETATION: Mild SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with heterogeneous serological responses in Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP assays. Anti-S1 responses showed faster rates of clearance, more rapid transition from high to low level production rate and greater reduction in production rate after this transition. In mild infection, anti-S1 serology alone may underestimate incident infections. The mechanisms that underpin faster clearance and lower rates of sustained anti-S1 production may impact on the longevity of humoral immunity.

Results: A 72 year-old male presented after a fall with one day of progressive distal limb weakness and numbness in the setting of a recent diarrheal illness. Exam demonstrated tetraparesis, distal sensation loss, and areflexia. Admission nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab was positive. Cerebrospinal fluid studies revealed albuminocytological dissociation and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of fluid was negative. Neurophysiologic studies performed supported a diagnosis of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy subtype of GBS. His course was complicated by respiratory failure, requiring intubation and eventual tracheostomy, dysautonomia, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Patient received a course of intravenous immunoglobulin and with near complete resolution 90 days after symptom onset. Conclusions: As a threat to global health, SARS-CoV-2 needs to be recognized as a possible trigger for GBS and patients should be screened and tested, as deemed appropriate by their care team. Ultimately, more epidemiological studies are needed to understand SARS-CoV-2 associated GBS and whether or not it varies from GBS caused by other infections.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 associated guillain-barr syndrome with dysautonomia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on society and economy are wide-ranging, long-lasting, and global. The experience of multiple countries or regions in fighting the pandemic indicates that there could be multiple COVID-19 surges, where a growing number of cases can be observed in the more recent surge(s). Were COVID-19 cases and clusters of cases (across surges) randomly distributed in spaces? Did population density and activity centres influence clusters of cases and associated venues? Based on information on the associated venues of the four surges of COVID-19 cases between January 2020 and February 2021 as well as population density, visuals were made to distinguish the relationships between population density, activity centres, and clusters of cases in Hong Kong. Different spatial patterns were observed across the four surges: fewer cases were observed in the first surge with a more evenly distributed pattern of clusters;the second surge as compared to the first surge saw a wider distribution and an increase in the number/layer of clusters;compared to the second surge, the third surge suffered from many more cases but saw a decrease in the general number of clusters;and compared to the previous three surges, the fourth surge had the largest number of cases, yet even fewer clusters were observed, where several clusters are again concentrated in specific areas similar to the previous surge. Across the four surges, a few locales could see recurrent clusters of cases and a few communities were without cases.","output":"Population density, activity centres, and pandemic: Visualizing clusters of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to rapid acceleration in the deployment of new digital technologies to improve both accessibility to and quality of care, and to protect staff. Mixed-reality (MR) technology is the latest iteration of telemedicine innovation; it is a logical next step in the move toward the provision of digitally supported clinical care and medical education. This technology has the potential to revolutionize care both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This pilot project sought to deploy the HoloLens2 MR device to support the delivery of remote care in COVID-19 hospital environments. METHODS: A prospective, observational, nested cohort evaluation of the HoloLens2 was undertaken across three distinct clinical clusters in a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Data pertaining to staff exposure to high-risk COVID-19 environments and personal protective equipment (PPE) use by clinical staff (N=28) were collected, and assessments of acceptability and feasibility were conducted. RESULTS: The deployment of the HoloLens2 led to a 51.5% reduction in time exposed to harm for staff looking after COVID-19 patients (3.32 vs 1.63 hours/day/staff member; P=.002), and an 83.1% reduction in the amount of PPE used (178 vs 30 items/round/day; P=.02). This represents 222.98 hours of reduced staff exposure to COVID-19, and 3100 fewer PPE items used each week across the three clusters evaluated. The majority of staff using the device agreed it was easy to set up and comfortable to wear, improved the quality of care and decision making, and led to better teamwork and communication. In total, 89.3% (25/28) of users felt that their clinical team was safer when using the HoloLens2. CONCLUSIONS: New technologies have a role in minimizing exposure to nosocomial infection, optimizing the use of PPE, and enhancing aspects of care. Deploying such technologies at pace requires context-specific information security, infection control, user experience, and workflow integration to be addressed at the outset and led by clinical end-users. The deployment of new telemedicine technology must be supported with objective evidence for its safety and effectiveness to ensure maximum impact.","output":"Use of the HoloLens2 Mixed Reality Headset for Protecting Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Prospective, Observational Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional approaches for data anonymization consider relational data and textual data independently. We propose rx-anon, an anonymization approach for heterogeneous semi-structured documents composed of relational and textual attributes. We map sensitive terms extracted from the text to the structured data. This allows us to use concepts like k-anonymity to generate a joined, privacy-preserved version of the heterogeneous data input. We introduce the concept of redundant sensitive information to consistently anonymize the heterogeneous data. To control the influence of anonymization over unstructured textual data versus structured data attributes, we introduce a modified, parameterized Mondrian algorithm. The parameter $\\\\lambda$ allows to give different weight on the relational and textual attributes during the anonymization process. We evaluate our approach with two real-world datasets using a Normalized Certainty Penalty score, adapted to the problem of jointly anonymizing relational and textual data. The results show that our approach is capable of reducing information loss by using the tuning parameter to control the Mondrian partitioning while guaranteeing k-anonymity for relational attributes as well as for sensitive terms. As rx-anon is a framework approach, it can be reused and extended by other anonymization algorithms, privacy models, and textual similarity metrics.","output":"rx-anon -- A Novel Approach on the De-Identification of Heterogeneous Data based on a Modified Mondrian Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital platforms have become an increasingly central concept for reflecting societal processes, but the historical and spatial embeddedness of platformization is often neglected as dystopian warnings and promises of efficiency take center stage. The Covid-19 pandemic has further intensified discussion and speculation regarding the future of digital platforms and changing everyday routines in (post-)pandemic cities. Drawing on the case study of Graz (Austria), this paper expands generalized speculation by a concrete exploration of what alternative platform futures in (post-)pandemic cities might hold. The underlying aims are to identify case-specific socio-spatial dynamics with respect to the platformization of on-demand food delivery in Graz and to explore in what ways these dynamics were influenced by the pandemic. The article contextualizes the development of food delivery platforms in Europe, taking into consideration long-term enabling conditions such as neoliberal restructuring, financialization and the crisis of social reproduction, but also the boom of delivery platforms during the lockdowns related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The case study draws on qualitative interviews with company officials, delivery workers, union representatives and restaurant owners to investigate the platforms' disruptive and unequal effects. Through this storying of the development of the platform economy for food deliveries in Graz from various perspectives in the pandemic city of the year 2020, the study challenges the narrative of a capital-driven and pervasive platformization. At the same time, the findings point out limitations of the local alternative platform model and contribute to the critical discourse on urban platforms.","output":"Towards alternative platform futures in post-pandemic cities?

Living strategies is a concept derived from the perspectives of people living with HIV, defined as behaviors, attitudes and beliefs adopted by people living with HIV to help deal with disability associated with HIV and multi-morbidity. Our aim was to describe disability among adults living with HIV and self-care living strategies used during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Adults living with HIV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, including some with pre-pandemic HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ) data, completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between JuneCAugust 2020. The survey included the HDQ and questions about self-care living strategy use during the pandemic. We compared disability (HDQ) scores prior to versus during the pandemic using paired t-tests. We reported the proportion of participants who engaged in various living strategies at least a few times a week or everyday during the pandemic. RESULTS: Of the 63 respondents, 84% were men, median age 57 years, and 62% lived alone. During the pandemic the greatest disability severity was in the uncertainty [median 30; Interquartile range (IQR): 16, 43] and mental-emotional (25; IQR: 14, 41) domains. Among the 51 participants with pre-pandemic data, HDQ severity scores were significantly greater (worse) during the pandemic (vs prior) in all domains. Greatest change from prior to during the pandemic was in the mental-emotional domain for presence (17.7; p < 0.001), severity (11.4; p < 0.001), and episodic nature (9.3; p < 0.05) of disability. Most participants (> 60%) reported engaging a few times a week or everyday in self-care strategies associated with maintaining sense of control and adopting positive attitudes and beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: People living with HIV reported high levels of uncertainty and mental-emotional health challenges during the pandemic. Disability increased across all HDQ dimensions, with the greatest worsening in the mental-emotional health domain.

AIM: To describe the epidemiology of delirium in patients hospitalized for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia during the pandemic peak in an academic hospital of Northern Italy, identify its clinical correlations and evaluate the association with mortality. METHODS: The clinical records of 852 patients admitted for suspect COVID-19 pneumonia, defined as respiratory symptoms or fever or certain history of contact with COVID-19 patients, plus chest CT imaging compatible with alveolar-interstitial pneumonia, were retrospectively analyzed. Delirium was defined after careful revision of daily clinical reports in accordance with the Confusion Assessment Method criteria. Data on age, clinical presentation, comorbidities, drugs, baseline lab tests and outcome were collected. The factors associated with delirium, and the association of delirium with mortality, were evaluated through binary logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients (11%) developed delirium during stay. They were older (median age 82, interquartile range, IQR 78-89, vs 75, IQR 63-84, p < 0.001), had more neuropsychiatric comorbidities and worse respiratory exchanges at baseline. At multivariate models, delirium was independently and positively associated with age [odds ratio (OR) 1.093, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.046-1.143, p < 0.001], use of antipsychotic drugs (OR 4.529, 95% CI 1.204-17.027, p = 0.025), serum urea and lactate-dehydrogenase at admission.

Large differences are reported in literature on wound complication rates. Aim was to perform a systematic review on reported postoperative wound complication (POWC) and postoperative wound infection (POWI) rates following the ELA and evaluate and quantify geographical differences. METHODS A literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and Cochrane Library. Studies before 2000, with <10 patients, biomechanical studies and reviews were excluded. No restrictions regarding language were applied. RESULTS 3068 articles were identified of which 123 were included, with 8584 calcaneal fractures in 28 different countries. The average total number of POWC was 14.3%, with 3.8% of superficial and 2.2% of deep infections. The highest POWI rate was found in Europe (12.1%) and the lowest in North America (2.8%). A significant difference in incidence of deep POWI between continents was detected (median 0-3.8%). No differences were found in incidence of POWC and POWI between retro- and prospective studies (respectively p=0.970, p=0.748) or studies with <10 or 10 operations per year (respectively p=0.326, p=0.378). However, lower rates of POWI were found in studies with a follow up of >3months (p=0.01). CONCLUSION Large differences were detected in incidence of POWC and POWI following calcaneal fracture surgery with the ELA between countries and continents. We did not find a lower POWC or POWI rate in retrospective studies compared to prospective studies, larger studies or in studies in which more patients were treated annually. However, the rate of POWI was significantly lower in studies with a follow up of >3months.

We utilize a state-of-the-art computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze these interconnections through international trade. We compare estimates of the impacts on US GDP in isolation and then examine the impacts taking into account US trade with China and the rest of the world (ROW). Our analysis indicates that these international trade linkage impacts are generally negative and range from near zero to very large overall, depending on the region, and that own- and cross-country impacts differ by region as well. At the same time, we find that China is able to capitalize on the situation by actually being able to increase its exports through international trade following mandatory closures in other regions.

Analysis of the pathological features in the lung tissues of patients who have died with COVID-19 could help us to understand the disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We systematically analysed lung tissue samples from 38 patients who died from COVID-19 in two hospitals in northern Italy between Feb 29 and March 24, 2020. The most representative areas identified at macroscopic examination were selected, and tissue blocks (median seven, range five to nine) were taken from each lung and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 48 h. Tissues were assessed with use of haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining for inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components (including staining with antibodies against CD68, CD3, CD45, CD61, TTF1, p40, and Ki-67), and electron microscopy to identify virion localisation. FINDINGS: All cases showed features of the exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage, which included capillary congestion (in all cases), necrosis of pneumocytes (in all cases), hyaline membranes (in 33 cases), interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema (in 37 cases), type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia (in all cases), squamous metaplasia with atypia (in 21 cases), and plateletCfibrin thrombi (in 33 cases). The inflammatory infiltrate, observed in all cases, was largely composed of macrophages in the alveolar lumina (in 24 cases) and lymphocytes in the interstitium (in 31 cases). Electron microscopy revealed that viral particles were predominantly located in the pneumocytes. INTERPRETATION: The predominant pattern of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 patients is diffuse alveolar damage, as described in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. Hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte atypical hyperplasia are frequent. Importantly, the presence of plateletCfibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels is consistent with coagulopathy, which appears to be common in patients with COVID-19 and should be one of the main targets of therapy.

Nursing students turning away from the nursing profession upon graduation may exacerbate nursing workforce shortfalls. The main objective of this study was to assess perceived occupational turnover intention among nursing students and associated factors (fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction). Students were also asked to provide suggestions that could enhance their intention to join the nursing profession. METHODS: An online survey was sent to all registered undergraduate nursing students at Fujian Medical University, China. The partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was used to investigate key factors influencing turnover intention. RESULTS: A total of 1020 complete responses were received (response rate: 86.2%). Nearly half (49.1%) reported that they would choose not to be on a nursing course if given a choice, 45.4% often think of not going into the nursing profession in the future, and 23.7% would consider entering a healthcare industry that has zero contact with patients. The total turnover intention score range was 3 to 15, and the mean  standard deviation (SD) was 9.2 (SD  2.5). PLS-SEM path analysis revealed that fear of COVID-19 ( = 0.226, p < 0.001) had a positive effect on turnover intention. Satisfaction with life ( = ?0.212, p < 0.001) had a negative effect on turnover intention. Analysis of open-ended survey data on students perspectives on how to encourage nursing students to enter the nursing workforce revealed five central themes: 1) professional role, respect, and recognition; 2) higher wages; 3) reduce workload; 4) enhance occupational health and safety; and 5) career advancement opportunities.

Participants from the Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction study were categorized according to smoking status (current or previous smoking vs no history of smoking). The primary imaging outcome was cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-assessed IS of left ventricular mass (%) at 30 days. The primary clinical outcome was the rate of MACE at 30 days and 1 year, defined as the composite of death, reinfarction, new-onset heart failure, or rehospitalization. Of 447 patients enrolled in Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction, 271 (60.6%) were current or past smokers. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers were almost 10 years younger and had a lower prevalence of clinical co-morbidities. Smokers had better procedural success and angiographic reperfusion compared with nonsmokers. At 30 days, there were no differences between smokers and nonsmokers in median IS (16.8% vs 17.4%, p = 0.67) or metrics of left ventricular function. By multivariable linear regression analysis, smoking was not significantly associated with IS at 30 days (beta coefficient: 0.83, p = 0.42). At 1 year, smokers had lower crude rates of MACE (7.6% vs 15%, p = 0.01).

In conclusion, smoking history had no significant effect on IS at 30 days. Although current or previous smokers had lower rates of 1-year MACE than those with no history of smoking, adjustment for baseline characteristics rendered this association nonsignificant. These findings support the hypothesis that the smoker's paradox is largely attributable to differences in demographic and clinical baseline risk, rather than differences in IS after primary percutaneous coronary intervention.","output":"Effect of Smoking on Infarct Size and Major Adverse Cardiac Events in Patients With Large Anterior ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (from the INFUSE-AMI Trial)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To quantify overall trends in patients treated for mental health disorders and adverse events, including via tele-mental health (TMH) and psychopharmacology during pandemic-related health care transformation.Methods: This longitudinal observational study analyzes veterans receiving mental health treatment at a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facility from January 1, 2017 to June 16, 2020.

However, no effective drugs or vaccines have been developed so far. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been considered as a promising supplementary treatment of this disease due to its clinically proven performance in many severe diseases, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Meanwhile, many reports suggest that the side-effects (SE) of TCM prescriptions cannot be ignored in treating COVID-19 as it often leads to dramatic degradation of the patients physical condition. Systematic evaluation of TCM regarding its latent SE becomes a burning issue. AIM: In this study, we used an ontology-based side-effect prediction framework (OSPF) developed from our previous work and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based deep learning, to evaluate the TCM prescriptions officially recommended by China for the treatment of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The OSPF developed from our previous work was implemented in this study, where an ontology-based model separated all ingredients in a TCM prescription into two categories: hot and cold. A database was created by converting each TCM prescription into a vector which contained ingredient dosages, corresponding hot/cold attribution and safe/unsafe labels. This allowed for training of the ANN model. A safety indicator (SI), as a complement to SE possibility, was then assigned to each TCM prescription. According to the proposed SI, from high to low, the recommended prescription list could be optimized. Furthermore, in interest of expanding the potential treatment options, SIs of other well-known TCM prescriptions, which are not included in the recommended list but are used traditionally to cure flu-like diseases, are also evaluated via this method. RESULTS: Based on SI, QFPD-T, HSBD-F, PMSP, GCT-CJ, SF-ZSY, and HSYF-F were the safest treatments in the recommended list, with SI scores over 0.8. PESP, QYLX-F, JHQG-KL, SFJD-JN, SHL-KFY, PESP1, XBJ-ZSY, HSZF-F, PSSP2, FFTS-W, and NHSQ-W were the prescriptions most likely to be unsafe, with SI scores below 0.1. In the additional lists of other TCM prescriptions, the indicators of XC-T, SQRS-S, CC-J, and XFBD-F were all above 0.8, while QF-Y, XZXS-S, BJ-S, KBD-CJ, and QWJD-Ts indicators were all below 0.1. CONCLUSIONS: In total, there were 10 TCM prescriptions with indicators over 0.8, suggesting that they could be considered in treating COVID-19, if suitable. We believe this work could provide reasonable suggestions for choosing proper TCM prescriptions as a supplementary treatment for COVID-19. Furthermore, this work introduces a novel and informative method which could help create recommendation list of TCM prescriptions for the treatment of other diseases.","output":"Evaluating the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Officially Recommended in China for COVID-19 Using Ontology-Based Side-Effect Prediction Framework (OSPF) and Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 genome accumulates point mutations constantly. However, whether non-synonymous mutations affect COVID-19 severity through altering viral protein function remains unknown.<br><br>Methods: We performed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in 90 patients with COVID-19 admitted at Keio University Hospital in Tokyo Metropolitan area between March and August 2020. Viral haplotypes were examined by counting the number of non-synonymous mutations to analyse phylogenic trees and comparative amino acid sequence. Statistically relevant non-synonymous mutations were functionally evaluated with structural analyses.<br><br>Findings: The number of non-synonymous mutations correlated inversely with the COVID-19 severity. Phylogenic tree analyses identified two predominant groups which were differentiated by a set of six point mutations (four non-synonymous amino acid mutations).

Patients with these mutations indicated significantly lower odds ratio for developing hypoxia which required supplemental oxygen (adjusted odds ratio 024 [95% CI 007-088, p-value = 0032]) after adjustments for age and sex, versus those lacking this haplotype in the canonical Clade 20B spread in Japan. The Pro108Ser 3CLpro enzyme decreases in the activity by 58%, and the hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveals that mechanisms for decline-of-function involve structural perturbation at the substrate-binding region which is positioned behind and distant from the 108th amino acid residue of the enzyme.<br><br>Interpretation: Viral genome sequencing in Tokyo showed that the specific mutant strain containing Pro108Ser mutation in 3CLpro, ameliorates the COVID-19 severity.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when many hospital visits are suspended and surgeries cannot be performed, the management of these patients represents a challenging clinical situation. This article presents a literature review and discussion of the pharmacologic management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia, which can be used as a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic until parathyroidectomy can be performed safely. METHODS: This narrative review was conducted by searching literature on the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases using the terms primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, cinacalcet, bisphosphonates, denosumab, vitamin D, raloxifene, hormone replacement therapy, coronavirus, and COVID-19. FINDINGS: Appropriate monitoring and remote medical follow-up of these patients are essential until the resolution of the pandemic. Cinacalcet is the drug of choice for controlling hypercalcemia, whereas bisphosphonate or denosumab is the drug for improving bone mineral density. Combined therapy with cinacalcet and bisphosphonates or cinacalcet and denosumab should be considered when the effects on serum calcium and bone mineral density are simultaneously desired. IMPLICATIONS: Medical management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia presents a reasonable alternative for parathyroid surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak and should be instituted until the pandemic ends and surgery can be performed safely.","output":"Management of Primary Hyperparathyroidism With Severe Hypercalcemia During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analyzing B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires is immensely useful in evaluating ones immunological status.

By selecting the most frequently occurring BCR sequences in a given repertoire and computing the sum of the vector representations of these sequences, we represent an entire repertoire as a 100-dimensional vector and eventually as a single data point in vector space. We demonstrate that our new approach enables us to not only accurately cluster repertoires of COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects, but also efficiently track minute changes in immunity conditions as patients undergo a course of treatment over time. Furthermore, using the distributed representations, we successfully trained an XG-Boost classification model that achieved over 87% mean accuracy rate given a repertoire of CDR3 sequences.","output":"Analysis of B-cell receptor repertoires in COVID-19 patients using deep embedded representations of protein sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global health emergency caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to alarming numbers of fatalities across the world. So far the researchers worldwide have not been able to discover a breakthrough in the form of a potent drug or an effective vaccine. Therefore, it is imperative to discover drugs to curb the ongoing menace. In silico approaches using FDA approved drugs can expedite the drug discovery process by providing leads that can be pursued. In this report, two drug targets, namely the spike protein and main protease, belonging to structural and non-structural class of proteins respectively, were utilized to carry out drug repurposing based screening. The exposed nature of the spike protein on the viral surface along with its instrumental role in host infection and the involvement of main protease in processing of polyproteins along with no human homologue make these proteins attractive drug targets. Interestingly, the screening identified a common high efficiency binding molecule named rutin. Further, molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent affirmed the stable and sturdy binding of rutin with these proteins. The decreased Rg value (4 nm for spike-rutin and 2.23 nm for main protease-rutin) and stagnant SASA analysis (485 nm/S2/N in spike-rutin and 152 nm/S2/N in main protease-rutin) for protein surface and its orientation in the exposed and buried regions suggests a strong binding interaction of the drug.

Some studies showed improvement in glycemic control attributed to more time for self-care and a more regular lifestyle schedule during the lockdown. However, most published data reflects a short duration of 3C5 months. The impact of long-term social isolation and transition to telemedicine on the health of T1DM patients remains unknown. Our study analyzes patient perception surrounding the impact of an 11-month lockdown on glycemic control, well-being, and self-reported depression symptoms. Methods: PHQ-9 was integrated into a 55-question survey created using RedCap, a secure portal for managing surveys. The survey was sent to 160 T1DM patients over the age of 18 to gauge their current diabetes management and overall well-being prior to, and during the pandemic. The survey also inquired about patients perceived effectiveness of telemedicine visits. PHQ9 scores were collected and analyzed along with survey responses. Results: Data collection is still ongoing. From the 47 responders, the PHQ9 screening showed 51% were in the minimal depression score, 34% in the range of mild depression, 11% in moderate depression, and 4% scored in moderate to severe depression. No patients scored within severe depression. In a regular week during the pandemic, 40% of patients experienced difficulty with their motivation and diabetes management and 60% reported no concern, as compared to 36% and 64% respectively before the pandemic. Among the 47 of patient respondents, 30 reported both A1c levels prior and during the pandemic of which 46% showed an improved A1c amid the pandemic, 10% had no change, and 44% reported a worsened A1c level. For the telehealth part of the survey, 90% of patients reported feeling comfortable with the level of care they receive via telemedicine, whereas the other 10% were not. Whilst 54% of patients preferred in-person visits and 46% indicated a preference for telehealth visits. Conclusion: T1DM management is challenging. The pandemic adds to the complexity and burden to both self-management and healthcare delivery. Staying locked down for a prolonged period of time imposes economical, psychological, and medical constraints to diabetes care, as nearly half of the patients reported worsening of glycemic control. Our comprehensive survey reports the longest duration reported up to date of how the COVID-19 lockdown impacts patients perceived changes in their mental health and diabetes management. It helps clinicians understand the connection between mental and physical health during the pandemic and improve time-restricted telehealth visits by understanding patient concerns.

Methods We performed global micro-RNA (miRNA) analysis in plasma in two cohorts encompassing 375 individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with late diabetic kidney disease and targeted proteomics analysis in plasma in four cohorts encompassing 746 individuals with late and early diabetic kidney disease. We examined structural lesions in kidney biopsies from the 105 individuals with early diabetic kidney disease. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the effects of miRNA mimics or inhibitors on regulation of candidate proteins. Results In the late diabetic kidney disease cohorts, we identified 17 circulating miRNAs represented by four exemplars (miR-1287-5p, miR-197-5p, miR-339-5p, miR-328-3p), which were strongly associated with 10-year risk of ESKD. These miRNAs targeted proteins in the axon guidance pathway. Circulating levels of six of these proteins-most notably EFNA4 and EPHA2-were strongly associated with 10-year risk of ESKD in all cohorts. Furthermore, circulating levels of these proteins correlated with severity of structural lesions in kidney biopsies. In contrast, expression levels of genes encoding these proteins had no apparent effects on the lesions. In in vitro experiments, mimics of miR-1287-5p and miR-197-5p and inhibitors of miR-339-5p and miR328-3p upregulated concentrations of EPHA2 in either cell lysate, supernatant, or both.

To understand whether SAA amyloidosis could also be a long-term risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we have used long all-atom molecular dynamic simulations to study the effect of a SARS-CoV-2 protein segment on SAA amyloid formation. Sampling over 40 s, we find that the presence of the nine-residue segment SK9, located at the C-terminus of the envelope protein, increases the propensity for SAA fibril formation by three mechanisms: it reduces the stability of the lipid-transporting hexamer shifting the equilibrium toward monomers, it increases the frequency of aggregation-prone configurations in the resulting chains, and it raises the stability of SAA fibrils. Our results therefore suggest that SAA amyloidosis and related pathologies may be a long-term risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Presence of a SARS-CoV-2 Protein Enhances Amyloid Formation of Serum Amyloid A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fractal statistics were applied to the daily new cases of COVID-19 in the USA.

BACKGROUND: High mortality amongst SARS\\\\Cov2 patients may be attributed to diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis. METHODS: A total of 220 COVID\\\\19 positive patients, hospitalized in North West General Hospital & Research Center, Peshawar, KP, Pakistan, from April to September 2020, were analysed using STATA 14. Patients with positive PCR were labelled as COVID\\\\19 positive and were included in the study. Patients with a clinical picture of COVID\\\\19 and negative PCR were excluded from the study. Those having ketonemia >0.6 and random blood glucose level >250mg/dl, while HCO3 (bicarbonate) 18, were labelled as diabetic ketoacidosis. The statistical significance level was set at p < .05. RESULTS: A total of 220 COVID\\\\19 patients were admitted; 166 (75.4%) were male and 54 (24.5%) were female. The mean age in years of the patients was 55.95 (SD13.9).

They utilize the spike (S) glycoprotein anchored in the viral envelope to mediate host attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes to initiate infection. The S protein is a major determinant of the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses and is also the main target of the host humoral immune response. We report here the 3.5-?-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the S glycoprotein trimer from the pathogenic porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), which belongs to the recently identified Deltacoronavirus genus. Structural and glycoproteomics data indicate that the glycans of PDCoV S are topologically conserved compared with the human respiratory coronavirus NL63 S, resulting in similar surface areas being shielded from neutralizing antibodies and implying that both viruses are under comparable immune pressure in their respective hosts. The structure further reveals a shortened S2' activation loop, containing a reduced number of basic amino acids, which participates in rendering the spike largely protease resistant. This property distinguishes PDCoV S from recently characterized betacoronavirus S proteins and suggests that the S protein of enterotropic PDCoV has evolved to tolerate the protease-rich environment of the small intestine and to fine-tune its fusion activation to avoid premature triggering and reduction of infectivity.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses use transmembrane S glycoprotein trimers to promote host attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. We determined a near-atomic-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the S ectodomain trimer from the pathogenic PDCoV, which is responsible for diarrhea in piglets and has had devastating consequences for the swine industry worldwide. Structural and glycoproteomics data reveal that PDCoV S is decorated with 78 N-linked glycans obstructing the protein surface to limit accessibility to neutralizing antibodies in a way reminiscent of what has recently been described for a human respiratory coronavirus. PDCoV S is largely protease resistant, which distinguishes it from most other characterized coronavirus S glycoproteins and suggests that enteric coronaviruses have evolved to fine-tune fusion activation in the protease-rich environment of the small intestine of infected hosts.","output":"Glycan Shield and Fusion Activation of a Deltacoronavirus Spike Glycoprotein Fine-Tuned for Enteric Infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viruses such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are a constant threat to public health given their ability to cause global pandemics.

Concerning the pandemic, teachers have been forced to find online teaching methods, which leads us to the central issue of this study of whether the effectiveness of online education depends on teachers digital skills. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the perceived digital competences of Romanian pre-tertiary cycle teachers about their professional status, school location, gender, age, taught field, and prior participation in training for online teaching. Using data from 3,419 self-completed questionnaires in an online survey of teachers performed at the beginning of the global lockdown in March 2020, we have built two reliable measures of perceived digital skills, namely the Self-Assessed Multimedia and Online Skills Score (SMOS) and the Self-Assessed Digital Office Skills Score (SDOS), which were the dependent variables in our study. Hierarchical linear regressions were used to test the hypotheses regarding the variations of dependent variables, measuring the two concepts of self-assessed digital skills (SMOS and SDOS). These concepts underlined that both decrease with age and are positively affected by prior attendance at training sessions for online teaching skills and by having ICT and informatics as a taught subject field. However, teachers of all specialties are relatively significantly less skilled in this field. The most important results concern the impact of gender and professional status on the teachers self-assessed digital competences. In summary, it appears that self-assessed office digital skills are a specialism demonstrated mainly by female teachers, while multimedia and online skills are perceived by teachers to be a male domain. Simultaneously, net of the other variables, a higher status within the teaching profession correlates positively with perceived office digital skills.

Although serotyping requires immunologic characterization, genotyping is an efficient means to identify IBVs detected in samples. Sanger sequencing of the S1 subunit of the spike gene is currently used to genotype IBV; however, the universal S1 PCR was created to work from cultured IBV, and it is inefficient at detecting multiple viruses in a single sample. We describe herein a MinION-based, amplicon-based sequencing (AmpSeq) method that genetically categorized IBV from clinical samples, including samples with multiple IBVs. Total RNA was extracted from 15 tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and PCR amplified using modified S1-targeted primers. Amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturers instructions into a 1D MinION sequencing library, and then sequenced on the MinION. The AmpSeq method detected IBV in 13 of 14 IBV-positive samples. AmpSeq accurately detected and genotyped both IBV lineages in 3 of 5 samples containing 2 IBV lineages. Additionally, 1 sample contained 3 IBV lineages, and AmpSeq accurately detected 2 of the 3 lineages.

Induction of expression of components of the complosome, particularly complement component C3, during transmigration from the circulation into peripheral tissues is a defining characteristic of monocytes and T cells in tissues. Intracellular complement activity is required to induce metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, including increased glycolytic flux and OXPHOS, which drive the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-. Consequently, reduced complosome activity translates into defects in normal monocyte activation, faulty Th1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and loss of protective tissue immunity.

Trusted Computing technology can be employed to protect the integrity of a system by leveraging a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and remote attestation. Existing research on remote attestation of virtualized environments differs in scalability, resource consumption, and provided security guarantees. While some approaches scale at large and use the TPM efficiently, they are way more intrusive, requiring changes to hypervisor and Virtual Machine (VMs). Others render entirely impractical with an increasing number of VMs, caused by the TPM being the bottleneck.

At the same time, extensive works have been conducted in order to unify clinical procedures and to validate and implement new technologies into a panel of ancillary tests. Recently evaluated computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion (CTA/CTP) seem to be superior to traditionally used digital subtraction angiography (DSA), transcranial Doppler (TCD) and cerebral perfusion scintigraphy for diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest (CCA). In this narrative review, we would like to demonstrate scientific evidence supporting the implementation of CTA/CTP in Polish guidelines for BD/DNC diagnosis. Research and implementation process: In the first of our base studies concerning the potential usefulness of CTA/CTP for the confirmation of CCA during BD/DNC diagnosis procedures, we showed a sensitivity of 96.3% of CTA in a group of 82 patients. CTA was validated against DSA in this report. In the second study, CTA showed a sensitivity of 86% and CTP showed a sensitivity of 100% in a group of 50 patients. In this study, CTA and CTP were validated against clinical diagnosis of BD/DNC supported by TCD. Additionally, we propose our CCA criteria for CTP test, which are based on ascertainment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) < 10 mL/100 g/min and cerebral blood volume < 1 mL/100 g in regions of interest (ROIs) localized in all brain regions. Based on our research results, CTA/CTP methods were implemented in Polish BD/DNC criteria. To our knowledge, CTP was implemented for the first time in national guidelines. Conclusions: CTA and CTP-derived CTA might be in future the tests of choice for CCA diagnosis, proper and/or Doppler pretest might significantly increase sensitivity of CTA in CCA diagnosis procedures. Whole brain CTP might be decisive in some cases of inconclusive CTA. Implementation of CTA/CTP in the Polish BD/DNC diagnosis guidelines does not show any major obstacles.

This outbreak led to profound governmental interventions along with a strict quarantine. This quarantine may have psychosocial impact on children and parents in particular. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 8 weeks COVID-19 quarantine on psychosocial functioning of Italian parents and their children. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, we included parents and children resided in Italy during the 8 weeks COVID-19 quarantine. We evaluated social and emotional functioning, clinical symptoms possibly related to emotional distress, and change in perspectives using a questionnaire. RESULTS: The majority of 2315 parents (98% mothers) frequently experienced fear of getting ill (92%) and fluctuating moods (84%), the latter showing correlation to experiencing stress due to being in continuous close vicinity to their children (77%, r = 0.33). Parents reported a positive effect on the relationship with their partner (79%) and their children (89%). Irritability in children was frequent (74%) and correlated to parental fluctuating moods (r = 0.40). The vast majority of the participants (91%) reported that their perspectives for the future had changed. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings suggest a profound impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on emotional functioning of parents and their children in Italy. Despite the protective measure of quarantine against national viral spread and subsequent infection, health care professionals should be aware of this emotional impact, in order to develop protective or therapeutic interventions.","output":"Psychosocial Impact of 8 Weeks COVID-19 Quarantine on Italian Parents and their Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Objetivo: Recopilar la informacin para el manejo del paciente que se encuentra hospitalizado por COVID19 para establecer acciones de cuidado de enfermera concretas y eficaces que permitan conducir los objetivos de la atencin de enfermera, as como sus resultados.

The primary aim of this study was to quantify the clinical and health-related quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measures for a population presenting with either mid-substance or insertional Achilles tendinopathy. METHODS: A prospective comparative observational study of consecutive patients with AT presenting for extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) at a large teaching hospital. The primary outcome was assessment of a validated health-related quality of life PROMs (Euroqol EQ-5D-5L) and comparison to 2 general UK population datasets. The secondary outcomes were Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS-Pain) and two validated foot-specific patient reported outcome measures (Foot Function Index (FFI) and Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A)). RESULTS: Between March 2014 and June 2021, 320 consecutive patients (125 male; 195 female) were diagnosed with AT and referred for a first course of ESWT. EQ-5D-5L PROMs were prospectively collected for 303 of these patients (94.7%). The mean age ( standard deviation(SD)) was 52.1  11.4 years. The mean EQ-5D-5L Index score (meanSD) for the AT cohort was 0.783  0.131. Patients less than 55 years with AT had a statistically significantly worse quality of life compared with members of the same age group in the general population. The mean VAS-Pain, FFI, VISA-A clinical outcome scores were 6.0  2.3, 49.5  21.2 and 34.1  14.4 respectively. There was a statistically significant moderate correlation between HRQOL and clinical PROMs (VAS-Pain and FFI vs EQ-5D) however there was no correlation with age. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patients under the age of 55 with AT have a significantly reduced quality of life compared with the general population.

Previous attempts at reconstructing the entire history of the sudden oak death (SOD) epidemic in California were limited by: (1) incomplete sampling; (2) the inability to include infestations caused by a single genotype of the pathogen; (3) collapsing of non-spatially contiguous yet genetically similar samples into large meta-samples that confounded the coalescent analyses. Here, we employ an intensive sampling coverage of 832 isolates of Phytopthora ramorum (the causative agent of SOD) from 60 California forests, genotyped at nine microsatellite loci, to reconstruct its invasion. By using age of infestation as a constraint on coalescent analyses, by dividing genetically indistinguishable meta-populations into highly-resolved sets of spatially contiguous populations, and by using Bruvo genetic distances for most analyses, we reconstruct the entire history of the epidemic and convincingly show infected nursery plants are the original source for the entire California epidemic. Results indicate that multiple human-mediated introductions occurred in most counties and that further disease sources were represented by large wild infestations. The study also identifies minor introductions, some of them relatively recent, linked to infected ornamental plants. Finally, using archival isolates collected soon after the discovery of the pathogen in California, we corroborate that the epidemic is likely to have resulted form 3 to 4 core founder individuals evolved from a single genotype. This is probably the most complete reconstruction ever completed for an invasion by an exotic forest pathogen, and the approach here described may be useful for the reconstruction of invasions by any clonally reproducing organism with a relatively limited natural dispersal range.

The Alpha- and Delta-specific reactions in the assay target mutations that are strongly linked to the target variant. The Alpha reaction targets the D3L substitution in the N gene, and the Delta reaction targets the spike gene 156 to 158 mutations. Additionally, we describe a second Delta-specific assay that we use as a confirmatory test for the Alpha-Delta assay that targets the 119 to 120 deletion in the Orf8 gene. Both reactions have similar sensitivities of 15 to 25 copies per reaction, similar to the sensitivity of commercial SC-2 detection tests. The Alpha-Delta assay and the Orf8(119del) assay were successfully used to classify clinical samples that were subsequently analyzed by whole-genome sequencing. Lastly, the capability of the Alpha-Delta assay and Orf8(119del) assay to identify correctly the presence of Delta RNA in wastewater samples was demonstrated. This study provides a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective tool for detecting and classifying two worldwide dominant SC-2 variants. It also highlights the importance of a timely diagnostic response to the emergence of new SC-2 variants with significant consequences on global health. IMPORTANCE The new assays described herein enable rapid, straightforward, and cost-effective detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SC-2) with immediate classification of the examined sample as Alpha, Delta, non-Alpha, or non-Delta variant. This is highly important for two main reasons: (i) it provides the scientific and medical community with a novel diagnostic tool to rapidly detect and classify any SC-2 sample of interest as Alpha, Delta, or none and can be applied to both clinical and environmental samples, and (ii) it demonstrates how to respond to the emergence of new variants of concern by developing a variant-specific assay. Such assays should improve our preparedness and adjust the diagnostic capacity to serve clinical, epidemiological, and research needs.","output":"Specific Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) Using a One-Step Quantitative PCR Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is controversial for treating COVID-19 patients. We aimed to estimate pooled risks of mortality, disease severity, and hospitalization associated with ACEI/ARB use and stratify them by country and country clusters. Methods: We conducted a search in various databases through 7/4/2020 and then applied random-effects models to estimate pooled risks (ORp) across stratifications by country cluster. Clusters were chosen to reflect outbreak times (China followed by Korea/Italy, others subsequently) and mobility restrictions (China and Denmark/France/Spain with stricter lockdowns than the UK/US). Results: Overall analysis showed no increase in mortality;however, a statistical increase in mortality was seen in the US/UK cluster with ORp=1.28[95%CI=1.04;1.56] and a decrease in China with ORp=0.65[95%CI=0.43;0.96] and France with OR=0.31[95%CI=0.14;0.69]. Severity and hospitalization were not statistically significant in the analysis;however, several associations were seen in specific countries but not in country clusters. Conclusion: The country-cluster meta-analysis provided a reasonable explanation for COVID-19 mortality among ACEI/ARB users.

Poor medication adherence could necessitate stronger and more expensive medications, which could place a significant burden on the healthcare system. Moreover, the importance of health literacy assessment as a factor influencing adherence in psoriasis patients cannot be overstated. This study aimed to evaluate the medication adherence level of Iranian Psoriasis patients and its relationship with the patients health literacy level and demographic conditions. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study among Iranian psoriasis patients conducted through a web-based questionnaire survey between 26 July 2020 and 5 January 2021 and a total of 575 samples were collected. The questionnaire consisted of 3 sections: First, demographic information and disease characteristics were evaluated. Second, the medication adherence was evaluated by using valid Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8), and, finally, the health literacy was evaluated by using Health Literacy for Iranian Adults (HELIA). Data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 22 with descriptive statistics; Chi-square and KruskalCWallis tests. Stepwise multiple linear regression was also used to evaluate the impact of independent variables related on medication adherence score. RESULTS: Results showed that the mean health literacy score in the study population was 74.3  14.23, and the mean medication adherence score was 4.1  2.18. Out of the total participants, 28.8% had high health literacy, 67.1% had adequate health literacy, and 4% had inadequate health literacy. The majority of the participants (70.7%) reported low adherence, while 24.1% reported moderate and 5.2% reported high adherence. The results of the Chi-square test showed a significant relationship between age, comorbidities, type of treatment, satisfaction with treatment, the experience of adverse effects, and health literacy with medication adherence (P < 0.05 for all). The final constructed model of stepwise multiple linear regression was highly statistically significant. The highest beta coefficient in the final model belonged to the total health literacy score. Conclusions. Based on the results, medication adherence among Iranian psoriasis patients is low. Health literacy correlates most strongly with medication adherence and is the best variable to determine it. Improving the access to the internet and the ICTs to enhance the patients\` health literacy along with developing the patient education approaches and techniques should be considered by health policymakers.","output":"Health literacy and medication adherence in psoriasis patients: a survey in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly across countries and has infected tens of millions of people all over the world.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The enzymes hydrolytic propertiesversatile peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase were used to identify their complexing strength with the lignin substrate, whereas endoglucanase cel12A, acidocaldarius cellulase, and Melanocarpus albomyces endoglucanase were tested on the cellulose gel substrate. Because the biodegradation properties are heavily influenced by the enzyme-substrate complexing energy level, proper molecular optimization and energy minimization of the enzymes and substrates were carried out, as well as the identification of the enzymes active sites prior to complexing.comprehensive molecular dynamic simulation was run to study theiralpha carbon, root-mean-square deviation (?), molecular surface area (?2), root-mean-square fluctuation (?), radius of gyration (nm), hydrogen bonds with hydrophobic interactions, and solvent accessible surface area (?2) values for 50 ns. The simulated data mining was conducted using advanced programming algorithms to establish the final enzyme-substrate complexing strength in binding and catalysis. RESULTS: Among the lignin-degrading enzymes, versatile peroxidase shows promising catalytic activity with the best docking pose and significant values in all the dynamic simulation parameters. Similarly, Melanocarpus albomyces endoglucanase shows the best activity in all aspects of molecular docking and dynamics among the cellulose-degrading enzymes. CONCLUSION: The lignin content of biomass wastes can be degraded into cellulose and hemicellulose using lignin-degrading enzymes. The cellulose can be further degraded into glucose and xylose sugars following the cellulose-degrading enzyme activity. These sugars can be further degraded into biofuel through anaerobic fermentation. Systematic bioconversion of the lignocellulosic components can ensure sustainable biomass management, creating an alternative food and energy source for human beings to face the challenges of global hunger where the enzymes can pave the way.","output":"Catabolic profiling of selective enzymes in the saccharification of non-food lignocellulose parts of biomass into functional edible sugars and bioenergy: An in silico bioprospecting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article discusses the use of the virtual scavenger hunt to engage radiologic science students with peers and course content in 2021.

However, for difficult cases, there are limited insertion techniques available in routine clinical practice, considering the flexibility of NGTs. The SUZY curved forceps are designed for the removal of pharyngolaryngeal foreign bodies under guidance of the McGRATH MAC (McG) videolaryngoscope. Because McG enables clear visualization of the esophageal inlet, we hypothesized that the SUZY forceps can facilitate easier NGT insertion compared with the conventional Magill forceps under McG guidance and designed a randomized, crossover manikin study to test this hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten anesthesiologists participated in this study. Each participant was instructed to insert an NGT using either the SUZY or the Magill forceps under McG guidance. Both types of forceps were used by each participant in a computer-generated random order. The primary outcome measure was the number of \\"strokes\\" (1 stroke was defined by a specific sequence of participant actions) required to advance the NGT 30 cm from the starting point. Data are expressed as medians (interquartile ranges [ranges]). RESULTS The number of strokes required for NGT insertion was fewer in the SUZY group than in the Magill group {7 [7.0-12.5 (5-14)] vs 16.5 [13.5-20.3 (7-22)]; P <.05}. The time required for NGT insertion was also lesser in the SUZY group than in the Magill group {15.4 [13.7-20.0 (7.0-38.3)] seconds vs 30.3 [22.0-42.3 (12.8-47.5) seconds]; P <.05}.

As patients are usually observed from hospital admission to discharge and drug initiation starts during hospitalization, advanced statistical methods are needed to account for time-dependent drug exposure, confounding and competing events. Our objective is to evaluate the observational studies on the three common methodological pitfalls in time-to-event analyses: immortal time bias, confounding bias and competing risk bias. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on 23 October 2020, in the PubMed database to identify observational cohort studies that evaluated drug effectiveness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We included articles published in four journals: British Medical Journal, New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet as well as their sub-journals. RESULTS: Overall, out of 255 articles screened, 11 observational cohort studies on treatment effectiveness with drug exposure-outcome associations were evaluated. All studies were susceptible to one or more types of bias in the primary study analysis. Eight studies had a time-dependent treatment. However, the hazard ratios were not adjusted for immortal time in the primary analysis. Even though confounders presented at baseline have been addressed in nine studies, time-varying confounding caused by time-varying treatment exposure and clinical variables was less recognized. Only one out of 11 studies addressed competing event bias by extending follow-up beyond patient discharge.

RESULTS Seventy-four studies with total 5560 pregnant women included in this systematic review. The results show that the pooled prevalence of neonatal mortality, lower birth weight, stillbirth, premature birth, and intrauterine fetal distress in women with COVID-19 was 4% (95% Cl: 1 - 9%), 21% (95% Cl: 11 - 31%), 2% (95% Cl: 1 - 6%), 28% (95% Cl: 13 - 43%), and 14% (95% Cl: 4 - 25%); respectively. Moreover, the pooled prevalence of fever, cough, diarrhea, and dyspnea were 56% (95% Cl: 32 - 81%), 29% (95% Cl: 21 - 38%), 9% (95% Cl: 2 - 16%), and 3% (95% Cl: 1 - 6%) in pregnant women with COVID-19.

Of the 110 patients, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 68-78) and 59.1% was male. Thirty-eight patients received HFNC when 200 mmHg < PO2/FiO2 [] 300 mmHg (early HFNC group), and 72 patients received HFNC treatment when 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 [] 200 mmHg (late HFNC group). Compared with the late HFNC group, patients in the early HFNC group had a lower likelihood of developing severe ARDS, longer time from illness onset to severe ARDS and shorter duration of viral shedding after illness onset, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay. Twenty-four patients died during hospitalization, of whom 22 deaths (30.6%) were in the late HFNC group and 2(5.3%) in the early HFNC group. It is concluded that the prognosis was better in severely ill elderly patients with COVID-19 receiving early compared to late HFNC. This suggests HFNC could be considered early in this disease process.","output":"The Outcome Impact of Early vs Late HFNC Oxygen Therapy in Elderly Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we report on a measurement study by researchers from several institutions that collected and analyzed network data to assess the impact of the first wave of COVID-19 (February-June 2020) on the Internet traffic.

Pathogenic variants in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene are the most frequent cause of early-onset AD. Medications for patients with AD bearing PSEN1 mutation (PSEN1-AD) are limited to symptomatic therapies and no established radical treatments are available. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based drug repurposing identified bromocriptine as a therapeutic candidate for PSEN1-AD. In this study, we used an enrichment strategy with iPSCs to select the study population, and we will investigate the safety and efficacy of an orally administered dose of bromocriptine in patients with PSEN1-AD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. AD patients with PSEN1 mutations and a Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese score of 25 will be randomly assigned, at a 2:1 ratio, to the trial drug or placebo group (4 patients in TW-012R and 2 patients in placebo). This clinical trial consists of a screening period, double-blind phase (9 months) and extension phase (3 months). The double-blind phase for evaluating the efficacy and safety is composed of the low-dose maintenance period (10 mg/day), high-dose maintenance period (22.5 mg/day) and tapering period of the trial drug. Additionally, there is an open-labelled active drug extension period for evaluating long-term safety. Primary outcomes are safety and efficacy in cognitive and psychological function. Also, exploratory investigations for the efficacy of bromocriptine by neurological scores and biomarkers will be conducted.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study in Kunming, China. A total of 33 mild COVID-19 cases were divided into two treatment groups (with and without glucocorticoids, methylprednisolone, were used in this setting), and the absolute value of peripheral blood lymphocyte count; CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts; and the time to achieve negative transformation of a nucleic acid pharyngeal swab were recorded. Peripheral blood lymphocyte and T cell counts were compared between the treatment group and 25 healthy individuals. At the point of time when there was a 50% accumulation conversion rate (positive to negative nucleic acid on pharyngeal swab), and the nucleic acid turned negative in half of the patients in two groups, the peripheral blood lymphocyte and T cell counts were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS: The mean cumulative time for the 50% negative conversion rate of the nucleic acid in the pharyngeal swab was 17.7  5.1 days and 13.9  5.4 days in the glucocorticoid group and the nonglucocorticoid group, respectively. The absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count and the T cell subset count in the glucocorticoid group were lower than those in the nonglucocorticoid group. When the nucleic acid turned negative in half of the patients, the absolute value of peripheral blood lymphocyte count and CD4+ T cells of the glucocorticoid group and the nonglucocorticoid group was not significantly different; the CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in the glucocorticoid group were lower than those in the nonglucocorticoid group. The absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count, CD3+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells in the glucocorticoid group were lower than those of the healthy group during the whole disease period, and CD8+ T cells returned to normal at 19-21 days of the disease period. There was no significant difference between the nonglucocorticoid group and the healthy group for absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte and CD8+ T cells; moreover, CD3+ T cells and CD4+ T cells were lower in the nonglucocorticoid group than those in the healthy group from the day of admission to the 18th day and returned to normal at the period of 19-21 days.

Material and Method: The data of 356 patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test who received treatment between June 2020 and August 2020 in our hospital were prospectively evaluated after the study was approved by the relevant ethics committee. Results: Of the 356 patients included in the study, 47 under the age of 18 years were excluded due to their unreliable examination and anamnesis findings. In addition, seven patients that died while in hospital were excluded from the study due to the lack of examination and survey records during their hospitalization. The data of the remaining 302 patients were statistically analyzed. Symptoms of cranial nerve involvement were observed in 135 patients. Conclusion: The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus commonly results in cranial nerve symptoms. The fact that these findings are more common and severe in COVID-19 than previous SARS and MERS outbreaks suggests that it has a more neurotrophic and more aggressive neuroinvasion.

We presented participants information on a hypothetical future COVID-19 vaccine -- including information on its side-effect rate -- and then examined the effect of three side-effect framing strategies on individuals stated willingness to take this vaccine: adding a qualitative risk label next to the numerical risk, adding comparison risks, and for those presented with comparisons, framing the comparison in relative rather than absolute terms.

FindingsAn incremental increase in the incidence of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events was observed with subsequent vaccinations. Following the booster, incidence rates of local and systemic reactions were 82.5% (13.4% [] Grade 3) and 76.5% (15.3% [] Grade 3), respectively, compared to 70.0% (5.2% [] Grade 3) and 52.8% (5.6% [] Grade 3), respectively, following the primary vaccination series. Events were primarily mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature, with a median duration of 1.0 to 2.5 days. Immune responses seen 14 days following the primary vaccination series were compared with those observed 28 days following the booster (Day 35 and Day 217, respectively). For the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, serum IgG geometric mean titers (GMTs) increased [~]4.7-fold from 43,905 ELISA units (EU) at day 35 to 204,367 EU at Day 217. Neutralization (MN50) assay GMTs showed a similar increase of [~]4.1-fold from 1,470 at day 35 to 6,023 at Day 217. A functional hACE2 receptor binding inhibition assay analyzing activity against ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 at Day 189 vs Day 217 found 54.4-fold (Ancestral), 21.9-fold (Alpha), 24.5-fold (Beta), 24.4-fold (Delta), and 20.1-fold (Omicron) increases in titers. An anti-rS IgG activity assay comparing the same time points across the same SARS-CoV-2 strains found titers improved 61.2-fold, 85.9-fold, 65.0-fold, 92.5-fold, and 73.5-fold, respectively. InterpretationAdministration of a booster dose of NVX-CoV2373 approximately 6 months following the primary vaccination series resulted in an incremental increase in reactogenicity along with enhanced immune responses. For both the prototype strain and all variants evaluated, immune responses following the booster were notably higher than those associated with high levels of efficacy in phase 3 studies of the vaccine.

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a case study methodology and employs 46 semi-structured interviews with senior managers of the three buying firms, four distribution centres and four supplying firms based in four countries (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China and India). Findings: Results reveal that manufacturers are refining production schedules to meet the production challenges. Distributors are working with secondary suppliers to meet the inventory shortage. Finally, supplying firms are evaluating the impact of demand, focusing on short-term demand-supply strategy, preparing for channel shifts, opening up additional channels of communication with key customers, understanding immediate customers demand and priorities and finally becoming more agile. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations to this study. First, the results of this study cannot be generalized to a wider population. Second, this study explores the interpretations of senior managers based in four Asian countries only. Practical implications: Supply chain firms can use these findings to understand how COVID-19 is affecting firms. Firms can also use the suggestions provided in this study to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and make the best out of this pandemic. Originality/value: This study contributes to the supply chain disruption literature by exploring the robust countermeasure taken by supply chain firms amid COVID-19 outbreak.

Specifically, the procedure called Transfer Learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target, often yielding remarkable results. The datasets utilized in this experiment are two. Firstly, a collection of 1427 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. Secondly, a dataset including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. The data was collected from the available X-ray images on public medical repositories. The results suggest that Deep Learning with X-ray imaging may extract significant biomarkers related to the Covid-19 disease, while the best accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained is 96.78%, 98.66%, and 96.46% respectively.

METHOD: Retrospective observational study of all patients admitted for COVID-19 and bacterial/fungal infections at the Hospital Clnico Universitario of Valladolid, Spain (March 1-May 31, 2020). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were compared based on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and predictors of mortality by were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 712 COVID-19 patients, 113 (16%) presented bacterial/fungal coinfections or superinfections. Their median age was 73 years (IQR 57-89) and 59% were men. The profiles of ICU patients (44%) included male, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, leukocytosis, elevated inteleukin-6, with interferon ?-1b and tocilizumab and superinfection (p < 0.05). Coinfections were diagnosed in 5% (39/712) patients. Most common pathogens of respiratory coinfection (18) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (6) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Superinfections were detected in 11% (80/712) patients.

Understanding the impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the host metabolism is still in its infancy but of great importance. Herein, we investigated the metabolic response during viral shedding and post-shedding in an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 ferret model (n = 6) challenged with two SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Virological and metabolic analyses were performed on (minimally invasive) collected oral swabs, rectal swabs, and nasal washes. Fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were only found in the nasal wash samples in four of the six ferrets, and in the samples collected 3 to 9 days post-infection (referred to as viral shedding). Central carbon metabolism metabolites were analyzed during viral shedding and post-shedding periods using a dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring (dMRM) database and method. Subsequent untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics of the same samples were performed using a Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS) methodology, building upon the identified differentiated central carbon metabolism metabolites. Multivariate analysis of the acquired data identified 29 significant metabolites and three lipids that were subjected to pathway enrichment and impact analysis. The presence of viral shedding coincided with the challenge dose administered and significant changes in the citric acid cycle, purine metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathways, amongst others, in the host nasal wash samples. An elevated immune response in the host was also observed between the two isolates studied.

A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3).

The purposes of this study are to (1) summarize organization collaboration patterns, successful experience and latent defects under across-stage evolution of Wuhan's cooperation governance mode against the pandemic, and on the basis, (2) reveal how the COVID-19 development trends and organizations' collaborative behaviors affected each other. Design/methodology/approach - Detailed content analysis of online news reports covering COVID-19 prevention and control measures on the website of Wuhan Municipal Government was adopted to identify organizations and their mutual collaborative interrelationships. Four complex network (CN) models of organization collaboration representing the outbreak, preliminary control, recession and normalization stages, respectively, were established then. Time-span-based dynamic parameter analyses of the proposed networks, comprising network cohesiveness analysis and node centrality analysis, were undertaken to indicate changes of global and local characteristics in networks. Findings - First, the definite collaborative status of Wuhan Headquarters for Pandemic Prevention and Control (WHPPC) has persisted throughout the period. Medical institutions and some other administrations were the most crucial participants collaborating with the WHPPC. Construction-industry organizations altered pandemic development trends twice to make the situation controllable. Media, large-scale enterprises, etc. set about underscoring themselves contributions since the third stage.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seem to be useful, but recently serious concerns regarding their adverse events have risen. The aim of the study was to broaden the general perspective of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19 treatment, based on an analysis of their current safety profile among patients with rheumatic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was based on a group of 152 patients with rheumatic diseases, aged 20-78 years, treated either with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Analyzed data included age, gender, comorbidities, type of drug, dosage, treatment duration, and reported adverse events. Cases of drug withdrawal related to adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: The dosage was consistent in both groups: 250 mg of chloroquine or 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily. 77.6% of patients did not experience any adverse reactions to the treatment. Hydroxychloroquine showed better safety profile, with 10.9% of patients reporting side-ffects, compared to 28.9% in patients treated with chloroquine. The overall incidence of ophthalmic complications was 6.6%. For both drugs, no statistically significant correlation between adverse events and age, chronic heart or liver disease, or hypertension was found. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine at lower doses, as used in rheumatic diseases, prove to be relatively safe. Data from the literature show that high dosage as recommended in COVID-19 treatment may pose a risk of toxicity and require precise management, but prophylactic, long-term use of lower, safe doses might be a promising solution.","output":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - safety profile of potential COVID-19 drugs from the rheumatologist's perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The housing crisis represents a liminal experience: a loss of the taken-for-granted and the suspension of ontological security has put individuals in a situation of potentiality in which both conceptions of home and of personal identity are open to transformation.

Background In response to reports of reduced scholarship by women across academic disciplines, the goal of this study was to understand the lived experiences of women scholars who identify as mothers. Method Academic women, including faculty and students, completed an online survey with demographic items and open-ended questions. From the collected data, responses from participants who identified as mothers (n = 51) were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Analysis of the data revealed that participants' roles as parents and scholarly women were inextricably intertwined, each serving as foundational components of their identities, a reality highlighted by the exacerbating stressors associated with COVID-19. Altered childcare demands, conflicting roles, and relational changes emerged as consequences of the ongoing pandemic, which compromised participants' ability to effectively attend to different aspects of their identity and sometimes resulted in the development of negative emotions. Conclusion Participants identified additional responsibilities due to the ongoing pandemic. Feeling pulled between their often-conflicting personal and professional identities, academic mothers cited a lack of supportive professional structures, which became more evident during COVID-19, as a barrier to their pursuit of scholarship.

Conspiracy beliefs mediated the link between political ideology and risk perception only among US Americans. Among Indians, right-wing ideology predicted conspiratorial blame for each of the parties. The relationship between conspiratorial blame and risk to self and others were more nuanced: those blaming scientists did not perceive risk to self;those who believed that the pandemic was a cover up for an economic crash believed an average Indian was at a higher risk. Considering a distinct relationship between the constructs in India, it can be argued that temporal and contextual information need to be explored in (cross-) cultural examinations.

Prone positioning has shown benefit as an adjunct supportive measure for patients who develop ARDS. However, studies assessing the benefit of prone positioning have excluded patients with reduced intracranial compliance resulting in a unique predicament, whereby patients with concomitant neurological diagnoses and ARDS have no defined treatment algorithm or recommendations for management. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature, performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 guidelines, yielded 10 articles for analysis. Utilizing consensus from these articles, in combination with review of multi-institutional proning protocols for patients with non-neurologic conditions, a proning protocol for patients with intracranial pathology and concomitant ARDS was developed. RESULTS: Among the 10 studies included in final analysis, there was consensus that prone positioning should be considered when there is evidence of acute lung injury or ARDS in patients with neurologic injury. Patients may be proned with a speciality bed or manually on a standard bed with the assistance of seven to nine personnel, in the manner described herein. Special consideration for patients requiring frequent neurologic exams and patients at risk of cardiac arrest or seizure are discussed. CONCLUSION: While elevations in ICP and reductions in CPP do occur during proning, they may not occur to a degree that would warrant exclusion of prone ventilation as a treatment modality for patients with ARDS and concomitant neurological diagnoses. In cases where ICP, CPP, and PbtO2 can be monitored, prone-position ventilation should be considered a safe and viable therapy.","output":"Prone-Position Ventilation in Patients with Neurologic Conditions: A Systematic Review of the Literature and Suggested Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Common envelope evolution (CEE) is believed to be an important stage in the evolution of binary/multiple stellar systems. Following this stage, the CE is thought to be ejected, leaving behind a compact binary (or a merger product). Although extensively studied, the CEE process is still little understood, and although most binaries have non-negligible eccentricity, the effect of initial eccentricity on the CEE has been little explored. Moreover, most studies assume a complete circularization of the orbit by the CE onset, while observationally such eccentricities are detected in many post-CE binaries. Here we use smoothed particle hydro-dynamical simulations (SPH) to study the evolution of initially eccentric ($0\\\\le e\\\\le0.95$) CE-systems. We find that initially eccentric binaries only partially circularize. In addition, higher initial eccentricity leads to a higher eccentricity following the end of the inspiral phase, with eccentricities as high as 0.18 in the most eccentric cases, and even higher if the initial peri-center of the orbit is located inside the star (e.g. following a kick into an eccentric orbit, rather than a smooth transition). CEE of more eccentric binaries leads to enhanced dynamical mass-loss of the CE compared with more circular binaries, and depends on the initial closest approach of the binary. We show that our results and the observed eccentricities of post-CE binaries suggest that the typical assumptions of circular orbits following CEE might potentially be revised. We expect post-CE eccentricities to affect the delay time distributions of various transients such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational-wave sources by up to tens of percents.","output":"Common envelope evolution of eccentric binaries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is widely used in biological and chemical sensing with fascinating properties. However, the application of SPR to detect trace targets is hampered by non-specific binding and poor signal.

Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a high-efficiency enzyme-free DNA amplification method operated at room temperature, in which two stable species of DNA hairpins coexist in solution until the introduction of the initiator strand triggers a cascade of hybridization events. At an optimal salt condition, as the concentrations of H1 and H2 increased, the HCR signals were enhanced, leading to signal amplification reaching up to 6.5-fold of the detection measure at 30 min. This feature enables DNA to act as an amplifying transducer for biosensing applications to provide an enzyme-free alternative that can easily detect complex DNA sequences. Improvement of more diverse recognition events can be achieved by integrating HCR with a phase-sensitive SPR (pSPR)-tested aptamer stimulus. This work seeks to establish pSPR aptamer system for highly informative sensing by means of an amplification HCR. Thus, combining pSPR and HCR technologies provide an expandable platform for sensitive biosensing.","output":"Biosensing Amplification by Hybridization Chain Reaction on Phase-Sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: A current technological trend, which has gained even more traction recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is the use of augmented reality (AR) in shopping environments. AR is addressing contemporary challenges rooted in online shopping (e.g. in terms of experientiality and try-on) and is fundamentally reshaping consumers' experiences. The purpose of this study is to provide a synthesized and structured overview of the state-of-the-art research focused on AR shopping. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a systematic literature review of the empirical academic corpus focused on shopping via AR technology. Findings: The review reveals the diverse psychological (cognitive, affective, and social) as well as behavioral outcomes related to the use of AR in the shopping context. The authors integrate the results into a framework for AR induced consumer behavior in shopping, thereby providing an important overview of the dynamics in AR-related shopping and the factors influencing the adoption of the technology by consumers. Specifically, the authors encountered that the technological abilities of AR (e.g. in terms of interactivity, vividness, informativeness, etc.) are a source for enhanced utilitarian and hedonic shopping experiences that can support intentions to purchase a product, reuse an AR app, or recommend it to others. Importantly, our review reveals the demand for several avenues for future research. Originality/value: The authors provide an overview and synthesis of how and where AR is employed in shopping contexts, what theories and technological characteristics of AR are commonly analyzed, and what psychological and behavioral outcomes AR has been found to evoke. Based on our findings, the authors derive a framework that illustrates the dynamics in AR shopping and give an in-depth discourse on 13 future research agenda points related to thematic, theoretical, methodological, and technological matters. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Using augmented reality for shopping: a framework for AR induced consumer behavior, literature review and future agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2)\\\\caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic has become a global health crisis with an extremely rapid progress resulting in thousands of patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) treatment who may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

To answer these questions, we use a triangulation of quantitative and qualitative methods by having 480 memes coded by three social media users for surprise, meaningfulness, elaboration, humor, and creativity and qualitatively analyzing those memes that score highly on each dimension. An interesting finding concerns the importance of elaboration and humor for the evaluation of creativity in the case of memes, above the more traditional criteria of surprise (proxy for novelty) and meaningfulness (proxy for appropriateness), perhaps a feature unique for Internet spaces.

We also assessed the incubation period and serial interval time differences between the non-cancer and cancer groups. Our results indicated that the overall mortality rate was higher among cancer patients with a high SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Covid-19 positive cancer patients with higher viral load are more prone to severe outcomes compared to non-cancer and low viral load patients. In addition, patients with lung and hematologic cancer have higher tendencies of severe events in proportion to high viral load. Higher attributable mortality and severity were directly proportional to high viral load particularly patients who are receiving anticancer treatment.

Previous work suggests that simple and scalable place-based environmental interventions can overcome the legacies of neighborhood disinvestment and have implications for health broadly and crime specifically. Objective To assess whether structural repairs to the homes of low-income owners are associated with a reduction in nearby crime. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study using difference-in-differences analysis included data from the City of Philadelphia Basic Systems Repair Program (BSRP) from January 1, 2006, through April 30, 2013. The unit of analysis was block faces (single street segments between 2 consecutive intersecting streets) with or without homes that received the BSRP intervention. The blocks of homes that received BSRP services were compared with the blocks of eligible homes that were still on the waiting list. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2019, to February 28, 2021. Exposures The BSRP intervention includes a grant of up to $20 000 provided to low-income owners for structural repairs to electrical, plumbing, heating, and roofing damage. Eligible homeowners must meet income guidelines, which are set by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and vary yearly. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was police-reported crime across 7 major categories of violent and nonviolent crimes (homicide, assault, burglary, theft, robbery, disorderly conduct, and public drunkenness). Results A total of 13 632 houses on 6732 block faces received the BSRP intervention. Owners of these homes had a mean (range) age of 56.5 (18-98) years, were predominantly Black (10 952 [78.6%]) or Latino (1658 [11.9%]) individuals, and had a mean monthly income of $993. These census tracts compared with those without BSRP intervention had a substantially larger Black population (49.5% vs 12.2%; |D| = 0.406) and higher unemployment rate (17.3% vs 9.3%; |D| = 0.357). The main regression analysis demonstrated that the addition to a block face of a property that received a BSRP intervention was associated with a 21.9% decrease in the expected count of total crime (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.76-0.80; P < .001), 19.0% decrease in assault (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.84; P < .001), 22.6% decrease in robbery (IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.75-0.80; P < .001), and 21.9% decrease in homicide (IRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86; P < .001). When restricting the analysis to blocks with properties that had ever received a BSRP intervention, a total crime reduction of 25.4% was observed for each additional property (IRR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73-0.77; P < .001). A significant dose-dependent decrease in total crime was found such that the magnitude of association increased with higher numbers of homes participating in the BSRP on a block. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that the BSRP intervention was associated with a modest but significant reduction in crime. These findings suggest that intentional and targeted financial investment in structural, scalable, and sustainable place-based interventions in neighborhoods that are still experiencing the lasting consequences of structural racism and segregation is a vital step toward achieving health equity.","output":"Association Between Structural Housing Repairs for Low-Income Homeowners and Neighborhood Crime."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently facing a serious SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic. This virus is a new isolate of coronavirus, and the current infection crisis has surpassed the SARS and MERS epidemics that occurred in 2002 and 2013, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 has currently infected more than 142,000 people, causing 5,000 deaths and spreading across more than 130 countries worldwide. The spreading capacity of the virus clearly demonstrates the potential threat of respiratory viruses to human health, thereby reiterating to the governments around the world that preventive health policies and scientific research are pivotal to overcoming the crisis. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes flu-like symptoms in most cases. However, approximately 15% of the patients need hospitalization, and 5% require assisted ventilation, depending on the cohorts studied. What is intriguing, however, is the higher susceptibility of the elderly, especially individuals who are older than 60 years of age, and have comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. In fact, the death rate in this group may be up to 10-12%. Interestingly, children are somehow less susceptible and are not considered as a risk group. Therefore, in this review, we discuss some possible molecular and cellular mechanisms by virtue of which the elderly subjects may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Toward this, we raise two main points, i) increased ACE-2 expression in pulmonary and heart tissues in users of chronic angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers; and ii) antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) after previous exposure to other circulating coronaviruses. We believe that these points are pivotal for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, and must be carefully addressed by physicians and scientists in the field.","output":"Susceptibility of the elderly to SARS-COV-2 infection: ACE-2 overexpression, shedding, and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HINTERGRUND: Die Lockdown-Phasen w?hrend der anhaltenden Coronavirus-Pandemie mit der Erkrankung COVID-19 haben die Art und Weise ver?ndert, wie Personen und Gemeinschaften leben, arbeiten und interagieren.

This study aimed to determine the extent to which the 24-h allocation of time to different physical behaviors changes between days working at the office (WAO) and days WFH in office workers during the pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected on 27 office workers with full-time employment at a Swedish municipal division during the COVID-19 outbreak in May-July 2020. A thigh-worn accelerometer (Axivity) was used to assess physical behavior (sedentary, stand, move) during seven consecutive days. A diary was used to identify periods of work, leisure and sleep. 24-h compositions of sedentary, standing and moving behaviors during work and non-work time were examined using Compositional data analysis (CoDA), and differences between days WAO and days WFH were determined using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Days WFH were associated with more time spent sleeping relative to awake, and the effect size was large (F = 7.4; p = 0.01; ?p2 = 0.22). The increase (34 min) in sleep time during WFH occurred at the expense of a reduction in work and leisure time by 26 min and 7 min, respectively.

AIMS To investigate the levels of vedolizumab in umbilical cord blood of newborns and rates of clearance after birth, as well as how these correlated with maternal drug levels, risk of infection and developmental milestones during the first year of life METHODS: Vedolizumab-treated pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease were prospectively recruited from 12 hospitals in Denmark and Canada in 2016-2020. Demographics were collected from medical records. Infant developmental milestones were evaluated by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). Vedolizumab levels were measured at delivery and, in infants, every third month until clearance. Non-linear regression analysis was applied to estimate clearance. RESULTS In 50 vedolizumab-exposed pregnancies, we observed 43 (86%) live births, seven (14%) miscarriages, no congenital malformations and low risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Median infant:mother vedolizumab ratio at birth was 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.56). The mean time to vedolizumab clearance in infants was 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.1-4.4). No infant had detectable levels of vedolizumab at 6 months of age. Developmental milestones at 12 months were normal or above average.

During in vitro HIV infection, the depleted nucleotide pool and high dUTP levels in monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) leads to proviruses with high levels of dUMP, which has been implicated in viral restriction or reduced transcription depending on the uracil base excision repair (UBER) competence of the macrophage. Incorporated dUMP has also been detected in viral DNA from circulating monocytes (MC) and alveolar macrophages (AM) of HIV infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), establishing the biological relevance of this phenotype but not the replicative capacity of dUMP-containing proviruses. As compared to in vitro differentiated MDM, AM from normal donors had 6-fold lower levels of dTTP and a 6-fold increased dUTP/dTTP, indicating a highly restrictive dNTP pool for reverse transcription. Expression of uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) was 8-fold lower in AM compared to the already low levels in MDM. Accordingly, 80% of HIV proviruses contained dUMP, which persisted for at least 14-days due to low UNG excision activity. Unlike MDM, AM expression levels of UNG and SAM and HD domain containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase 1 (SAMHD1) increased over 14 days post-HIV infection, while dUTP nucleotidohydrolase expression decreased. These AM-specific effects suggest a restriction response centered on excising uracil from viral DNA copies and increasing relative dUTP levels. Despite the restrictive nucleotide pools, we detected rare replication competent HIV in AM, peripheral MC, and CD4+ T cells from ART-treated donors. These findings indicate that the potential integration block of incorporated dUMP is not realized during in vivo infection of AM and MC due to the near absence of UBER activity. In addition, the increased expression of UNG and SAMHD1 in AM post-infection is too slow to prevent integration. Accordingly, dUMP persists in integrated viruses, which based on in vitro studies, can lead to transcriptional silencing. This possible silencing outcome of persistent dUMP could promote viral latency until the repressive effects of viral dUMP are reversed.","output":"Replication-competent HIV-1 in human alveolar macrophages and monocytes despite nucleotide pools with elevated dUTP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose: Volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (RT) has become pivotal in the treatment of prostate cancer recurrence (RPC) to optimize dose distribution and minimize toxicity, thanks to the high-precision delineation of prostate bed contours and organs at risk (OARs) under multiparametric magnetic resonance (mpMRI) guidance We aimed to assess the role of pre-treatment mpMRI in ensuring target volume coverage and normal tissue sparing Material and Methods: Patients with post-prostatectomy RPC eligible for salvage RT were prospectively recruited to this pilot study Image registration between planning CT scan and T2w pre-treatment mpMRI was performed Two sets of volumes were outlined, and DWI images/ADC maps were used to facilitate precise gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation on morphological MRI scans Two rival plans (mpMRI-based or not) were drawn up Results: Ten patients with evidence of RPC after prostatectomy were eligible Preliminary data showed lower mpMRI-based clinical target volumes than CT-based RT planning (p = 0 0003): median volume difference 17 5 cm3 There were no differences in the boost volume coverage nor the dose delivered to the femoral heads and penile bulb, but median rectal and bladder V70Gy was 4% less (p = 0 005 and p = 0 210, respectively) for mpMRI-based segmentation Conclusions: mpMRI provides high-precision target delineation and improves the accuracy of RT planning for post-prostatectomy RPC, ensures better volume coverage with better OARs sparing and allows non-homogeneous dose distribution, with an aggressive dose escalation to the GTV Randomized phase III trials and wider datasets are needed to fully assess the role of mpMRI in optimizing therapeutic strategies","output":"The Role of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance in Volumetric Modulated Arc Radiation Therapy Planning for Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has shaken our health care and economic systems, prompting re-evaluation of long-held views on how best to deliver care.

Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, the World Health Organization has recommended that people comply with a set of preventive measures to reduce the infection rate (e.g., social distancing, wearing a face mask, thorough personal hygiene). Such recommendations imply certain personal restrictions, with people typically differing in the extent to which they are willing to comply with said recommendations. The present large-sampled study (N = 800) aimed to investigate whether narcissism levels and message framing strategies affect individuals willingness to accept personal restrictions and, consequently, comply with a set of preventive health behaviors. Results reveal that people high (vs. low) in narcissism are less likely to accept personal restrictions and to comply with preventive health behaviors. However, negative (vs. positive) message framing increases narcissists willingness to comply with such behaviors. This effect can be explained through an increased willingness of narcissistic participants to accept personal restrictions to protect themselves (egoistic motivation) but not through a willingness to protect vulnerable people (altruistic motivation). These findings suggest that individuals who remain uncooperative during pandemics could be more effectively addressed with adapted message framing strategies and incentives tailor-made for their distinct personalities.","output":"Selfless or Selfish?

Thus, we aimed to define the healthy microbiota and the viral pathogen-affected microbiota in the upper respiratory tract. In addition, any association between the type of viral agent and the resultant microbiota profile was assessed. METHODS: We analyzed the upper respiratory tract bacterial content of 57 healthy asymptomatic people (17 health-care workers and 40 community people) and 59 patients acutely infected with influenza, parainfluenza, rhino, respiratory syncytial, corona, adeno, or metapneumo viruses using culture-independent pyrosequencing. RESULTS: The healthy subjects harbored primarily Streptococcus, whereas the patients showed an enrichment of Haemophilus or Moraxella. Quantifying the similarities between bacterial populations by using Fast UniFrac analysis indicated that bacterial profiles were apparently divisible into 6 oropharyngeal types in the tested subjects. The oropharyngeal types were not associated with the type of viruses, but were rather linked to the age of the subjects. Moraxella nonliquefaciens exhibited unprecedentedly high abundance in young subjects aged <6 years. The genome of M. nonliquefaciens was found to encode various proteins that may play roles in pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 6 oropharyngeal microbiome types.

Due to the COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]) pandemic, these therapies are switching to telehealth and telemedicine practices, but access and utilization may be limited due to state policies and social vulnerability. Objective: The objective of this cross-sectional analysis was to evaluate the policy changes to telehealth provisions during the pandemic and the degree to which structural barriers could stymie the intended impact of these policies (e.g., PT/OT accessibility). Materials and Methods: Our analysis examined each states' telehealth policies in relation to PT/OT, ranked their telehealth readiness, identified relationships between existing policies and opioid prescription rates, and discussed how social determinants of health may be associated with telehealth availability and accessibility. Results: Approximately two of five states have both telehealth and telemedicine policies, whereas the majority of states had either a PT- or OT-specific policy in place. In addition, almost all states and the District of Columbia (90%) had general telehealth/medicine policy changes as a result of the pandemic. Discussion: Although such policy changes could reduce COVID-19-related barriers, the degree to which these policies can have a large and long-lasting impact may be contingent on structural barriers. Many states that lack broadband access and have high social vulnerability need more improvements to ensure the utilization of telehealth care, including PT and OT.

Here we take the coronavirus pandemic as a global and extraordinarily consequential case, and study the global policy response by analyzing a novel dataset recording policy documents published by government agencies, think tanks, and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) across 114 countries (37,725 policy documents from Jan 2nd through May 26th 2020). Our analyses reveal four primary findings. (1) Global policy attention to COVID-19 follows a remarkably similar trajectory as the total confirmed cases of COVID-19, yet with evolving policy focus from public health to broader social issues. (2) The COVID-19 policy frontier disproportionately draws on the latest, peer-reviewed, and high-impact scientific insights. Moreover, policy documents that cite science appear especially impactful within the policy domain. (3) The global policy frontier is primarily interconnected through IGOs, such as the WHO, which produce policy documents that are central to the COVID19 policy network and draw especially strongly on scientific literature. Removing IGOs' contributions fundamentally alters the global policy landscape, with the policy citation network among government agencies increasingly fragmented into many isolated clusters.

As different respiratory viruses exhibit similar symptoms, simultaneous detection of these viruses in a single reaction mixture can save time and cost. The present study was done in a tertiary care children's hospital for rapid identification of viruses causing SARI among children less than or equal to five years of age using multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit. METHODS: A total of 155 throat swabs were collected from equal number of children suspected to have SARI and processed for extraction of nucleic acids using automated extraction system. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was done to identify the viruses in the samples. RESULTS: The overall positivity for viruses in the study was found to be 72.9 per cent with a co-infection rate of 19.5 per cent. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was the predominant virus detected in 25.7 per cent children followed by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, human rhinovirus (HRV) and human adenovirus (HAdV) in 19.9, 11.0 and 8.8 per cent children, respectively. The HMPV was at its peak in February 2013, HAdV showed two peaks in March-April, 2012 and November 2012-March 2013 while HRV was detected throughout the year. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex real-time PCR helped in rapid identification of viruses. Seventeen viruses were detected in SARI cases with overall positivity of 72.9 per cent.

Levels of monoamine oxidases (MAOs) play a critical role in DA metabolism and oxidative damage. Increased levels of the MAO-B enzyme in the elderly raise oxidative damage and enhance neurodegenerative processes. Inhibiting MAO-B as an attractive target would be the best method for treating and understanding Parkinson's disease. This study aimed to recognize a suitable inhibitor for the MAO-B enzyme using computational biology and compared it with Safinamide as a positive control. We used various computational biology techniques such as binding free energy, virtual screening, molecular dynamics (MD), and docking considerations to achieve the goal. To obtain a potent inhibitor, 41,852 compounds were taken from the Zinc database. After preparing compounds and the MAO-B enzyme, screening was performed using AutoDock Vina software. After screening, a potent natural inhibitor (ZINC00261335) was picked, and then, subsequent MD simulations for both ZINC00261335 and Safinamide were conducted via GROMACS software. The stability of the MAO-B_ZINC00261335 complex was excellent during the simulation, and the results of MM-PBSA analysis explicated that ZINC00261335 with (-118.353kJmol-1) is more potent than Safinamide (-89.305kJmol-1). Ultimately, the ADME study (lipophilicity, drug similarity and pharmacokinetic parameters) for ZINC00261335 was revealed, which is acceptable for human use.

Paraguay, a small South-American country, was not an exception. This work results from the urgent need to reopen universities, schools, and other academic institutions to resume teaching activities in light of restrictive access to online learning in Paraguay. In order to contain the spread of this virus, school activities such as course lectures were placed on hold indefinitely. Inappropriate airflow in an enclosed space is one of the main factors in the spread of this virus. When combined with personal protective equipment, proper air ventilation and air replacement can significantly reduce this airborne virus's spread. Potential sources of contaminant accumulation are stagnant locations of air in a closed volume. It is, therefore, essential to first identify these hot spots. Utilizing computational tools, such as CFD, an airflow analysis can be conducted to see any potential stagnant point. In the case of a classroom, it will then allow proper airflow by avoiding stagnant points by moving furniture, equipment, and chairs in combination to adding walls and opening windows and doors. This type of CFD study will set the benchmark for future classroom layout standards in this pandemic background. The work discussed here is a case study on a 300 student classroom at the Faculty of Engineering at the National University of Asuncion. The CFD results showed detailed information on flow patterns and velocity profiles in the analyzed classroom environment and air cycle and exhaust results. The six air conditioning systems blowing 300 CFM each, combined with eight fans installed at the ceiling, forced air to recirculate and helped to remove old air to the windows and suction some new air from doors. This helped university administrators to reopen some class areas and keep their faculties and students safe for lectures. It is important to remark here that air reposition could be measured, showing 200 CFM air removal in this first simulation run. Further analysis with a different internal layout will be needed to see if any improvements can be made. It is expected to have a much better air removal by adding a localized exhaust fan.

However, in place of the location, clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, we consider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies they generate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism of resistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes to the dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These include attenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustrating variational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate its use in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficient immunological assaybased on sequential serologythat provides a (1) quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (2) a Bayes optimal classification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucose tolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance).

In this work, we examine whether the new boarding processes lead to increased or decreased risk of infection spread. We also study the reasons behind the risk differences associated with different boarding processes. We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using pedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives. Our results show that back-to-front boarding roughly doubles the infection exposure compared with random boarding. It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a typical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping middle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show that the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this case as with middle seats occupied. We show that the increased exposure arises from the proximity between passengers moving in the aisle and while seated. Such exposure can be reduced significantly by prohibiting the use of overhead bins to stow luggage.

RESULTS: Pregnant women with higher scores of HES and HL had lower likelihood of anxiety (odds ratio, OR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 0.73, 0.87; p < .001; and OR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.90, 0.99; p = .018) and depression (OR, 0.84; 95%CI, 0.78, 0.91; p < .001; and OR, 0.96; 95%CI, 0.91, 0.99; p = .044), respectively. Pregnant women being employed had a lower FCoV-19S score (regression coefficient, B, ?1.46; 95%CI, ?2.51, ?0.40; p = .007). Besides, other significant predictors of anxiety were eating healthier during the pandemic, unchanged or more physical activity, elevated gestational age and smoking. Other significant predictors of depression were eating healthier during the pandemic, elevated gestational age and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Among others, HES and HL had positive impacts on protecting pregnant women against anxiety and depression. Improving HES and HL should be addressed as a strategic approach to improve reproductive health during the pandemic. KEY MESSAGE: The COVID-19 pandemic influences antenatal mental disorders with the higher level as opposed to that before the pandemic. Healthy eating behaviour and better health literacy (HL) had critical roles in lowering prenatal anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 crisis. Strategic approaches for improving healthy eating and HL should be recommended for protecting pregnant women from mental health problems during the pandemic.","output":"Fear, anxiety and depression among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic: impacts of healthy eating behaviour and health literacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel type of coronavirus infection emerged in the Wuhan province of China and began to spread rapidly. In this study, we aimed to determine the differences between COVID-19 disease and Influenza. METHODS: This retrospective study included 164 children with COVID-19, as well as 46 children with Influenza. The two groups were compared with respect to clinical and laboratory parameters and the rates of intensive care and mechanical ventilation requirement. RESULTS: In both groups, the most common admission complaints were fever and cough. As compared to the COVID-19 group, the Influenza group had significantly higher rates of cough (37 [80.4%] and 38 [23.2%]), fever (31 [67.4%] and 34 [20.7%]), muscle pain (34 [73.9%] and 31 [18.9%]), vomiting (13 [28.9%] and 8 [4.9%]) and tachypnea (32 [69.6%] and 3 [1.8%]) (P < .01 for all comparisons). The mean WBC count (7.10  1.08 vs. 10.90  1.82), mean neutrophil count (3.19  0.58 vs. 6.04  0.97), APTT, CRP, procalcitonin, ALT, and LDH levels were significantly lower in the COVID-19 group compared to the Influenza group (P < .05 for all comparisons). There was, however, no significant difference between the mean lymphocyte counts of both groups. The Influenza group had significantly higher rates of intensive care requirement (19 [41.3%] vs. 3 [1.8%]) and mechanical ventilation requirement (16 [34.8%] vs. 2 [1.2%]) as well as a significantly higher mortality rate (7 [15.2%] vs. 2 [1.2%]) than the COVID-19 group (P < .01).

COVID-19 has put the health systems in the various Arab Countries and their ability to deliver healthcare services under tremendous strain. The capacity and stability of any health system is important in any type of response to the pandemic, in order to ensure an effective and efficient delivery of care to the public through COVID-19 and beyond. The objective of this study is to identify the various response of health systems in Arab Countries to COVID-19, and highlight the legal and health challenges faced during the pandemic. The study identified both gaps and good practices that may be utilized in order to guide the efforts in response to COVID-19 and the recovery efforts once the pandemic is over. METHODS: To determine why the response of some health systems in Arab Countries responses are more effective than others, a three-step framework is adopted which includes, detection, containment, and treatment stages. In order to identify which countries are excelling at detection, containment, and treatment stages, several indicators were selected for each stage. To be able to understand the legal and health challenges of response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an analysis of the health systems, the resources in terms of quality and access, health workforce, and finance was conducted. Secondary data published by the Global Burden of Disease Study, and the Global Change Data Lab of the University of Oxford was used to study identified gaps and good practices to guide the responses to COVID-19 and recovery efforts once the pandemic is over. RESULTS: The epidemiologic record demonstrates that that certain Arab countries are managing to control the pandemic, through a combination of mitigation strategies, suppression strategy and elimination strategy. There are several barriers and challenges in Arab health systems which have been amplified due to COVID-19 and if ignored may pose a further significant challenge in the future. Health systems in Arab countries are not sufficiently equipped to handle all healthcare needs related to COVID-19, in particular issues relating to administration, equity, finances, the supply side of healthcare, and usage of information technology. CONCLUSION: In Arab counties, the standard response to COVID-19 was enforced by new health laws, which consist of a combination of the traditional disease control measures (testing, contact-tracing, social distancing), population-based physical distancing (including stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, and social gathering bans), travel limits (including travel bans, and border closures), and economic support measures.

However, the role of maternal-fetal genetic interactions (MFGI) and parent-of-origin (imprinting) effects in PA remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate MFGI in MB-OP, and imprinting effects in relation to risk of PA. METHODS: Among Peruvian mother-infant pairs (503 PA cases and 1052 controls), independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with linkage-disequilibrium coefficient <0.80, were selected to characterize genetic variations in MB-OP (78 SNPs in 24 genes) and imprinted genes (2713 SNPs in 73 genes). For each MB-OP SNP, four multinomial models corresponding to fetal allele effect, maternal allele effect, maternal and fetal allele additive effect, and maternal-fetal allele interaction effect were fit under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, random mating, and rare disease assumptions. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used for model selection. For each SNP in imprinted genes, imprinting effect was tested using a likelihood ratio test. Bonferroni corrections were used to determine statistical significance (p-value < 6.4e-4 for MFGI and p-value < 1.8e-5 for imprinting). RESULTS: Abruption cases were more likely to experience preeclampsia, have shorter gestational age, and deliver infants with lower birthweight compared with controls. Models with MFGI effects provided improved fit than models with only maternal and fetal genotype main effects for SNP rs12530904 (p-value = 1.2e-04) in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase [CaM kinase] II beta (CAMK2B), and, SNP rs73136795 (p-value = 1.9e-04) in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), both MB genes. We identified 320 SNPs in 45 maternally-imprinted genes (including potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 [KCNQ1], neurotrimin [NTM], and, ATPase phospholipid transporting 10 A [ATP10A]) associated with abruption. Top hits included rs2012323 (p-value = 1.6E-16) and rs12221520 (p-value1.3e-13) in KCNQ1, rs8036892 (p-value = 9.3E-17) and rs188497582 in ATP10A, rs12589854 (p-value = 2.9E-11) and rs80203467 (p-value = 4.6e-11) in maternally expressed 8, small nucleolar RNA host (MEG8), and rs138281088 in solute carrier family 22 member 2 (SLC22A2) (p-value = 6.8e-9).

Particularly challenging are the lack of agreed-upon management guidelines and variations in practice. Our hospital is a large, secondary-care government hospital in Kuwait, which has increased its capacity by approximately 28% to manage the care of patients with COVID-19. The surge in capacity has necessitated the redeployment of staff who are not well-trained to manage such conditions. There was a great need to develop a tool to help redeployed staff in decision-making for patients with COVID-19, a tool which could also be used for training. METHODS: Based on the best available clinical knowledge and best practices, an eight member multidisciplinary group of clinical and quality experts undertook the development of a clinical algorithm-based toolkit to guide training and practice for the management of patients with COVID-19. The team followed Horabin and Lewis' seven-step approach in developing the algorithms and a five-step method in writing them. Moreover, we applied Rosenfeld et al's five points to each algorithm. RESULTS: A set of seven clinical algorithms and one illustrative layout diagram were developed. The algorithms were augmented with documentation forms, data-collection online forms and spreadsheets and an indicators' reference sheet to guide implementation and performance measurement. The final version underwent several revisions and amendments prior to approval. CONCLUSIONS: A large volume of published literature on the topic of COVID-19 pandemic was translated into a user-friendly, algorithm-based toolkit for the management of patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: Online cross-sectional survey of 30,375 adults in the UK from 21st March to 4th April 2020 (sample weighted). Logistic regression models were used to examine sociodemographic, drinking and COVID-19 factors associated with i) drinking less and ii) drinking more (versus same as usual). RESULTS: Of 22,113 drinkers, 48.1 % reported drinking about the same, 25.7 % reported drinking less, and 26.2 % reported drinking more than usual over the past week. Drinking less was independently associated with being younger (OR = 0.88, p < .001), male (OR = 0.76, p < .001), BAME (OR = 0.76, p = .028), low income (OR = 0.74, p < .001), having COVID-19 (OR = 2.04, p < .001), adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviours (OR = 1.58, p = .020), stress about becoming ill from COVID-19 (OR = 1.26, p = .004) and not being a key worker (OR = 0.87, p = .030).

Industry and governments have reacted, investing over US$105 billion in vaccine research.1 The Holy Grail is a universal, pan-coronavirus, vaccine to protect humankind from future SARS-CoV-2 variants and the thousands of similar coronaviruses with pandemic potential.2 This paper proposes a new vaccine candidate that appears to attenuate the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus variants to render it safe to use as a vaccine. Moreover, these results indicate it may be efficacious against 99% of 365 coronaviruses. This research model is wet-dry-wet; it originated in genomic sequencing laboratories, evolved to computational modeling, and the candidate result now require validation back in a wet lab. Objectives This studys purpose was to test the hypothesis that machine learning applied to sequenced coronaviruses genomes could identify which amino acid substitutions likely attenuate the viruses to produce a safe and effective pan-coronavirus vaccine candidate. This candidate is now eligible to be pre-clinically then clinically tested and proven. If validated, it would constitute a traditional attenuated virus vaccine to protect against hundreds of coronaviruses, including the many future variants of SARS-CoV-2 predicted from continuously recombining in unvaccinated populations and spreading by modern mass travel. Methods Using machine learning, this was an in silico comparative effectiveness research study on trinucleotide functions in nonstructural proteins of 365 novel coronavirus genomes. Sequences of 7,097 codons in the ORF1ab gene were collected from 65 global locations infecting 68 species and reported to the US National Institute of Health. The data were proprietarily transformed twice to enable machine learning ingestion, mapping, and interpretation. The set of 2,590,405 data points was randomly divided into three cohorts: 255 (70%) observations for training; and two cohorts of 55 (15%) observations each for testing. Machine learning models were trained in the statistical programming language R and compared to identify which mixture of the 7.097  1023 possible amino-acid-location combinations would attenuate SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that have infected humans. Results Contests of machine-learning algorithms identified nine amino-acid point substitutions in the ORF1ab gene that likely attenuate 98.98% of 365 (361) novel coronaviruses. Notably, seven substitutions are for the amino acid alanine. Most of the locations (5 of 9) are in nonstructural proteins (NSPs) 2 and 3. The substitutions are alanine to (1) valine at codon 4273; (2) leucine at codon 5077; (3) phenylalanine at codon 2001; (4) leucine at codon 372; (5) proline at codon 354; (6) phenylalanine at codon 2811; (7) phenylalanine at codon 4703; (8) leucine to serine at codon 2333; and, (9) threonine to alanine at codon 5131.

We tested and compared various self-sampling methods of self-pharyngeal swab and self-saliva sampling from non-carrier volunteers. We found that the self-saliva sampling procedure gave expected negative results from all of the non-carrier volunteers within 2 hours, indicating cost-effectiveness, speed and reliability of the saliva-based method. For an automated assessment of the sampling quality and degree of positivity for COVID-19, we developed scalable formulae based on a logistic classification model using both cycle threshold and melting temperature from the qRT-PCR results.

This study draws on a unique linkage between the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and state voter files to characterize voting trajectories in later life and explore their determinants. METHODS: Using sequence analysis, we identify 5 voting typologies based on turnout and voting methods over 8 biennial elections. Using multinomial logistic and Poisson regressions, we examine the role of physical, cognitive, and mental health and wealth in shaping enfranchisement and civic participation at older ages. RESULTS: Health and wealth are both positively associated with voter turnout, but the negative impact of poor health on voting declines with increasing wealth. Voting at the polls and early voting are more common among healthier older adults, whereas absentee voting is more common among older voters who are more affluent, less healthy, or both. Among those less wealthy, absentee methods mitigate the impact of poor health for previously active voters, but do not compensate for a lower turnout rate. In addition to physical and cognitive limitations, emotional difficulties and depression reduce turnout, particularly among the least wealthy.

Further evaluation of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer should be performed in large-scale comparative studies using the laparoendoscopic, single-site staging operation to confirm the safety and benefits of the RSSS operation for early-stage endometrial cancer.","output":"Robotic single-site staging operation for early-stage endometrial cancer: initial experience at a single institution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The low complexity domain (LCD) sequence has been defined in terms of entropy using a 12 amino acid sliding window along a protein sequence in the study of disease-related genes. The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-related TDP-43 protein sequence with intra-LCD structural information based on cryo-EM data was published recently. An application of entropy and Higuchi fractal dimension calculations was described using the Znf521 and HAR1 sequences. A computational analysis of the intra-LCD sequence entropy and Higuchi fractal dimension values at the amino acid level and at the ATCG nucleotide level were conducted without the sliding window requirement. The computational results were consistent in predicting the intermediate entropy/fractal dimension value produced when two subsequences at two different entropy/fractal dimension values were combined. The computational method without the application of a sliding-window was extended to an analysis of the recently reported virulent genesOrf6, Nsp6, and Orf7ain SARS-CoV-2. The relationship between the virulence functionality and entropy values was found to have correlation coefficients between 0.84 and 0.99, using a 5% uncertainty on the cell viability data. The analysis found that the most virulent Orf6 gene sequence had the lowest nucleotide entropy and the highest protein fractal dimension, in line with extreme value theory. The Orf6 codon usage bias in relation to vaccine design was discussed.","output":"Entropy and Fractal Dimension Study of the TDP-43 Protein Low Complexity Domain Sequence in ALS Disease Severity and SARS-CoV-2 Gene Sequences in Virulence Variability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efficient contact tracing and testing are fundamental tools to contain the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We used multi-agent simulations to estimate the daily testing capacity required to find and isolate a number of infected agents sufficient to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, so decreasing the risk of new waves of infections. Depending on the non-pharmaceutical mitigation policies in place, the size of secondary infection clusters allowed or the percentage of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic (i.e., subclinical) infections, we estimated that the daily testing capacity required to contain the disease varies between 0.7 and 9.1 tests per thousand agents in the population. However, we also found that if contact tracing and testing efficacy dropped below 60% (e.g. due to false negatives or reduced tracing capability), the number of new daily infections did not always decrease and could even increase exponentially, irrespective of the testing capacity. Under these conditions, we show that population-level information about geographical distribution and travel behaviour could inform sampling policies to aid a successful containment, while avoiding concerns about government-controlled mass surveillance.","output":"Containment of COVID-19: Simulating the impact of different policies and testing capacities for contact tracing, testing, and isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed attack rates for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in three categories of hospital workers (nurses, nonmedical support staff, and other technical or medical staff) in all public hospitals in Hong Kong that had admitted SARS patients.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of prospectively collected data. The post-operative safety and adequacy of a single cannula tracheostomy tube was compared to a double cannula tracheostomy tube in patients undergoing tracheostomy during major oral and oropharyngeal resections. RESULTS Out of 46 patients with the single cannula tube, 7 (15 per cent) experienced significant obstruction warranting immediate tube removal, while another 9 (20 per cent) needed a change of tube or tube re-insertion for continued airway protection. In contrast, out of 50 patients with the double cannula tube, the corresponding numbers were 0 (p = 0.004) and 1 (2 per cent; p = 0.007) respectively. CONCLUSION Insertion of a double cannula (instead of a single cannula) tracheostomy tube in the course of major oral and oropharyngeal resections offers better airway protection during the post-operative period.","output":"Single cannula versus double cannula tracheostomy tubes in major oral and oropharyngeal resections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a molecular dynamics simulation study of dense ice modeled by the reactive force field (ReaxFF) potential, focusing on the possibility of phase changes between crystalline and plastic phases as observed in earlier simulation studies with rigid water models.

The basic reproduction number (R(0)) is an epidemiologic parameter for understanding the characterization of disease and its dynamics in a population. We aimed to estimate the R(0) of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtypes H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6, which were associated with nine outbreaks in Korea between 2003 and 2018, to understand the epidemic transmission of each subtype. According to HPAI outbreak reports of the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, we estimated the generation time by calculating the time of infection between confirmed HPAI-positive farms. We constructed exponential growth and maximum likelihood (ML) models to estimate the basic reproduction number, which assumes the number of secondary cases infected by the index case. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the epidemic statistics between subtypes. The estimated generation time of H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6 were 4.80 days [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.23C5.38] days, 7.58 (95% CI 6.63C8.46), and 5.09 days (95% CI 4.44C5.74), respectively. A pairwise comparison showed that the generation time of H5N8 was significantly longer than that of the subtype H5N1 (P = 0.04). Based on the ML model, R(0) was estimated as 1.69 (95% CI 1.48C2.39) for subtype H5N1, 1.60 (95%CI 0.97C2.23) for subtype H5N8, and 1.49 (95%CI 0.94C2.04) for subtype H5N6. We concluded that R(0) estimates may be associated with the poultry product system, climate, species specificity based on the HPAI virus subtype, and prevention policy. This study provides an insight on the transmission and dynamics patterns of various subtypes of HPAI occurring worldwide.

Dental implants, bone substitutes and membranes in dentistry possess different properties focused on improving the healing process when in contact with oral tissues. The early saliva interaction was shown to impair some positive features present in biomaterials related to quick cellular adhesion and proliferation, such as surface hydrophilicity, cellular viability and antibacterial properties. Moreover, biomaterials that interacted with contaminated saliva containing specific bacteria demonstrated favorable conditions for increased bacterial metabolism. Additionally, the quantity of investigations associating biomaterials with early saliva interaction is still scarce in the current literature and requires clarification to prevent clinical failures.

Existing concepts used to interpret cooperation in the European Union, like harmonization, are unfulfilling, as they are used in different ways depending on the field in which they are applied. Currently, common ground and conceptual clarity are lacking. In an attempt to provide the kind of simplicity that facilitates cross-disciplinary analysis, we introduce the concept of aligning rulesets, a five-level framework for studying international cooperation (differentiating between (1) full alignment, (2) methods-based alignment, (3) ends-based alignment, (4) principles-based alignment and (5) no alignment).

To address the global threat, in-depth investigations in pathogenesis are essential for interventions in infectious diseases and vaccine development. Interestingly, aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases (aaRSs), an ancient enzyme family that was once considered to play housekeeping roles in protein synthesis, are involved in multiple viral infectious diseases. Many aaRSs in eukaryotes present as the components of a cytoplasmic depot system named the multi-synthetase complex (MSC). Upon viral infections, several components of the MSC are released and exert nonenzymatic activities. Host aaRSs can also be utilized to facilitate viral entry and replication. In addition to their intracellular roles, some aaRSs and aaRS-interacting multi-functional proteins (AIMPs) are secreted as active cytokines or function as molecule communicators on the cell surface. The interactions between aaRSs and viruses ultimately affect host innate immune responses or facilitate virus invasion.

To dig further into the understanding of urban freight transport movements, in this research, we conducted a case study in which we estimated an origin-destination matrix for the trucks traveling on Autopista Central, one of Santiago de Chiles most important urban highways. To do so, we used full real-world vehicle-by-vehicle information of freight vehicles movements along the highway. This data was collected from several toll collection gates equipped with free-flow and automatic vehicle identification technology. However, this data did not include any vehicle information before or after using the highway. To estimate the origins and destinations of these trips, we proposed a multisource methodology that used GPS information provided by SimpliRoute, a Chilean routing company. Nevertheless, this GPS data involved only a small subset of trucks that used the highway. In order to reduce the bias, we built a decision tree model for estimating the trips origin, whose input data was complemented by other public databases. Furthermore, we computed trip destinations using proportionality factors obtained from SimpliRoute data. Our results showed that most of the estimated origins belonged to outskirt municipalities, while the estimated destinations were mainly located in the downtown area.
