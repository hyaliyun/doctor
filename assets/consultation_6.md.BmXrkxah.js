This paper demonstrates the capability of an inexpensive portable pyroelectric linear array infrared spectrometer to rapidly test ABHR and compare the performance with a benchtop Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and HS-GC-MS. Multicomponent partial least square quantification models were built with performance found to be comparable between the two spectrometers and with the HS-GC-MS. Furthermore, the portable spectrometer was field-tested with real-world samples in Malaysia on both retail products (Group A) and freely deployed public dispensers (Group B) between May and November 2020. A total of 386 samples were tested. Only 75.2% of Group A met the criteria of safe and effective ABHR [no detectable methanol and alcohol concentration above 60% (v/v)], while <50% of Group B did. In addition, 7.4 and 18.8% of Group A and Group B, respectively, were found to contain methanol above permissible limits. The high percentage of sub-standard and methanol-containing samples combined with the frequent use of ABHR by the public highlights the need for and importance of a portable and rapid testing device for widespread screening of ABHR against falsified products and protects the general public.","output":"Inexpensive Portable Infrared Device to Detect and Quantify Alcohols in Hand Sanitizers for Public Health and Safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in culture-independent research techniques have led to an increased understanding of the gut microbiota and the role it plays in health and disease. The intestine is populated by a complex microbial community that is organized around a network of metabolic interdependencies. It is now understood that the gut microbiota is vital for normal development and functioning of the human body, especially for the priming and maturation of the adaptive immune system. Antibiotic use can have several negative effects on the gut microbiota, including reduced species diversity, altered metabolic activity, and the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms, which in turn can lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections. There is also evidence that early childhood exposure to antibiotics can lead to several gastrointestinal, immunologic, and neurocognitive conditions. The increase in the use of antibiotics in recent years suggests that these problems are likely to become more acute or more prevalent in the future.

Preventing the formation of biofilm is an efficient way to develop antibacterial surfaces. The strategy for constructing the antibacterial surface is divided into bacteria repelling and bacteria killing based on the formation of the biofilm. Material surface wettability, adhesion, and steric hindrance determine bacteria repelling performance. Bacteria should be killed by surface chemistry or physical structures when they are attached to a material surface irreversibly. Killing approaches are usually in the light of the cell membrane of bacteria.

In most children CMPA resolves by age 5 or 6; however, if not treated correctly can provoke nutritional deficiency resulting in poor growth. Management consists of excluding cows milk from the diet, with hypoallergenic formulas (or non-dairy alternatives) being introduced to meet nutritional requirements. Objectives: To compare the cost-effectiveness of hypoallergenic formulas in reducing allergic manifestations and promoting immune tolerance in infants with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated symptoms of CMPA. Methods: A trial-based decision analytic cohort model was developed to simulate the occurrence of urticaria, eczema, asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, or being symptom-free in infants with CMPA in the United Kingdom. Amino acid-based formula (AAF), extensively hydrolysed casein formula containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus Gorbach Goldin (EHCF+LGG), extensively hydrolysed whey formula (EHWF), and soy formula (SF) were compared using the National Health Service (NHS) perspective, 3-year time horizon and 3.5% discount rate for cost and health consequences. Hypoallergenic formulas comparative efficacy was sourced from a prospective cohort study. Resources required to manage allergic symptoms were sourced from published literature, validated by a UK clinician, and applied to UK cost resources. Results were reported as cost per additional child free from allergic manifestations at 3 years and cost per additional immune tolerant child at 3 years. Results: In the base case, infants receiving EHCF+LGG were associated with lower NHS resource use and improved CMPA tolerance. Over the 3-year treatment period, savings of 119, 476, and 1094 were achieved with EHCF+LGG compared to SF, EHWF and AAF, respectively. Infant formula accounted for the largest proportion of resource consumption averaging 44% for all comparators, with a minimum of 31% for SF and a maximum of 53% for AAF over 3 years. General practitioners visits constituted the second highest cost component, approximately 17% of total costs across comparators. The results were robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that increased systematic data collection efforts aligned with postpartum care guidelines and attention to postpartum visit attendance rates may help to target policies to improve maternal wellbeing. Most estimates indicate that a substantial proportion of women do not attend at least one postpartum visit, potentially contributing to maternal morbidity as well as preventing a smooth transition to future well-woman care. Estimates of current postpartum visit attendance are important for informing efforts that seek to increase postpartum visit attendance rates and to improve the quality of care.","output":"Postpartum Visit Attendance in the United States: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), has recently posed a significant threat to global public health.

Environment friendly strategies to extend the quality of grapes after commercial maturity provide healthy and profitable sustainability in market chain. In the present study, possibilities to maintain the quality of grape clusters on grapevines without any chemical treatments have been studied under vineyard conditions in temperate climate characteristics of Konya Province in Central Anatolia. Grape clusters of Alphonse Lavalle and Narince, one of the most popular conventional grape cultivar in Turkey, were kept on the vines trained with bilateral cordon system. The vines were drip irrigated during the hot summer and the vine canopy was covered with black nets after veraison to protect from the birds, hail and climatic extremities. After commercial maturity, twelve cluster samples per cultivar were collected with monthly intervals to investigate the changes in quality. Up to the 3rd sampling date (at the end of November 2019), little losses in quality features were determined in both cultivars. At the end of the study, at 4th moth (December), significant decay incidences were observed with similar patterns in cultivars. General findings demonstrated that the grape clusters could be maintained on grapevines under intact condition of the cool autumn season in temperate zone by protecting them from the external damages using convenient protective materials up to three or four months depending on the response of cultivars to environmental variables.","output":"Maintaining the Grape Quality on Organically Grown Vines (Vitis vinifera L.) at Vineyard Condition under Temperate Climate of Konya Province"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has a surmount impact on the exchequer of all the countries across the world.

Soon after, the infected cases and mortality increased rapidly. The future of the pandemics progress was uncertain, and thus, predicting it became crucial for public health researchers. These predictions help the effective allocation of health-care resources, stockpiling, and help in strategic planning for clinicians, government authorities, and public health policymakers after understanding the extent of the effect. The main objective of this paper is to develop a hybrid forecasting model that can generate real-time out-of-sample forecasts of COVID-19 outbreaks for five profoundly affected countries, namely the USA, Brazil, India, the UK, and Canada. A novel hybrid approach based on the Theta method and autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model, named Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model, is developed. Daily new cases of COVID-19 are nonlinear, non-stationary, and volatile; thus, a single specific model cannot be ideal for future prediction of the pandemic. However, the newly introduced hybrid forecasting model with an acceptable prediction error rate can help healthcare and government for effective planning and resource allocation. The proposed method outperforms traditional univariate and hybrid forecasting models for the test datasets on an average.","output":"Stochastic forecasting of COVID-19 daily new cases across countries with a novel hybrid time series model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to unprecedented transformations in consumer behaviour. Less is known about how consumers react to privacy stress while being compelled to continuously purchase online during the pandemic. Therefore, underpinned by the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory, this paper aims to examine the impacts of perceived Internet risk, self-efficacy, privacy stress, and trust on consumers continuous purchasing intention in China. Few studies have examined the mediating roles of privacy stress and brand trust in continuous purchasing intention. This research thus adds value by exploring the underlying mechanisms that explain how these factors affect purchasing intention where consumers have little choice but to make purchase online continuously. It employs a quantitative research design and uses a survey questionnaire to collect data. A total of 535 consumers responded and the data were analysed via PLS-SEM. We found mixed results for the direct and indirect paths. Perceived Internet risk, platform trust, and self-efficacy showed significant impacts on privacy stress and brand trust. While brand trust had a significant impact on continuous online purchase intention, contrary to previous literature, privacy stress did not. Moreover, while brand trust was found to be a significant mediator, privacy stress exerted no mediating effect. The results assist marketing practitioners, organizations, and policymakers in improving consumers online shopping experience in uncertain times by addressing the issues of trust and privacy. Specifically, we provide the foundation for future policies and strategies that build consumers trust and secure consumers privacy, especially in highly uncertain contexts.","output":"Do Privacy Stress and Brand Trust still Matter?

Although in many cases the infection causes very weak symptoms, it can be severe in patient with diverse chronical diseases and immunological compromising patients. Pregnancy is a unique condition in which mother and fetus peacefully collaborate. Diverse endocrine-immune mechanisms, mostly under progesterone control work together to protect the fetus from maternal immunocompetent cell activation driven rejection. The physiological shift to Th2 dominant environment, while favourable for fetus, it makes mothers susceptible to infective pathogens, making pregnancy during COVID-19 pandemic challenging. MATERIALS AND METHODS Studies involving COVID-19 in pregnancy and those analysing changes of immune system induced by COVID-19 were searched in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect. Databases were searched using a keyword COVID-19/coronavirus, that was combined with following terms: immune system, pregnancy, oestrogen, or progesterone. Search included studies published up to 01.07.2020. Almost 1,500 articles were found, but only 18 met criteria. RESULTS Most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 in mothers infected in the late pregnancy were fever and cough accompanied with lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein. Mothers reported to have severe disease had comorbidities and were obese. Low rate of neonatal complications of maternal Sars-Coc-2 infection without neonatal mortality was observed.

Absent an effective vaccine, preventive measures used, some of which are being relaxed, have included school closures, restriction of movement, and banning of large gatherings. Our goal was to estimate the association of voter turnout with county-level COVID-19 risks. METHODS: We used publicly available data on voter turnout in the March 10 primary in three states, COVID-19 confirmed cases by day and county, and county-level census data. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to estimate the association of voter turnout with COVID-19 incidence, adjusted for county-level population density and proportions: over age 65 years, female, Black, with college education, with high school education, poor, obese, and smokers. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk was associated with voter turnout, most strongly in Michigan during the week starting 3 days postelection (risk ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.33). For longer periods, the association was progressively weaker (risk ratio 0.98-1.03).

When feasible, surgical resection of NELM offers the best long-term outcomes. General indications for hepatic resection include performance status acceptable for major liver surgery, grade 1 or 2 tumors, absence of extrahepatic disease, adequate size and function of future liver remnant, and feasibility of resecting >90% of metastases. Adjunct therapies including concomitant liver ablation are generally safe when used appropriately and may expand the number of patients eligible for surgery. Among patients with synchronous resectable NELM, resection of the primary either in a staged or combined fashion is recommended. For patients who are not surgical candidates, liver-directed therapies such as transarterial embolization, chemoembolization, and radioembolization can provide locoregional control and improve symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Multiple systemic therapy options also exist for patients with advanced or progressive disease.

We hereby present the imprints of lockdown on water quality (both chemical and biological) parameters during the nationwide lockdown (COVID-19 epidemic) in India between 25th March to 30th May 2020. The present study describes the changes in chemical and biological water quality parameters based on twenty-two groundwater samples from the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin in Southern India, taken before (10 and 11th February 2020) and during the lockdown (19 and 20th April 2020) periods. The physico-chemical parameters compared are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO(3)), fluoride (F), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se), and the bacterial parameters are total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and fecal streptococci. Among the metals, the significant reductions in Se (42%), As (51%), Fe (60%) and Pb (50%) were noticed probably owing to no or very less wastewater discharges from metal-based industries, seafood-based industries and thermal power plants during the lockdown. Reduction in NO(3) (56%), total coliform (52%) and fecal coliforms (48%) indicated less organic sewage from the fishing industries. Contents of Cr, Cu, Zn and Cd, however, remained similar and fluoride did not show any change, probably as they were sourced from rock-water interactions. Similarly, we did not observe alterations in E. coli and fecal streptococci due to no significant change in domestic sewage production during the lockdown. The multivariate analyses aptly illustrated this and the principal component analyses helped to identify the sources that controlled water qualities of the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period. Our observation implies that groundwater is definitely under active interaction with surface waters and thus a quick revival could be observed following the seizing of anthropogenic activities.","output":"Imprints of pandemic lockdown on subsurface water quality in the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin, South India: A revival perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read with great interest the study by Raba and colleagues (Volume 109, Issue 10).1 The authors aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in neonates and children under one year of age.

In this situation, the travelers decision-making for tourism destinations was heavily affected by this global event. Social media usage has played an essential role in travelers decision-making and increased the awareness of travel-related risks from the COVID-19 outbreak. Online consumer media for the outbreak of COVID-19 has been a crucial source of information for travelers. In the current situation, tourists are using electronic word of mouth (eWOM) more and more for travel planning. Opinions provided by peer travelers for the outbreak of COVID-19 tend to reduce the possibility of poor decisions. Nevertheless, the increasing number of reviews per experience makes reading all feedback hard to make an informed decision.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing efforts to minimize spread may have improved hospitalized children's sleep by decreasing unnecessary overnight disruptions. This study aimed to describe the impact of these efforts on pediatric inpatient sleep using objective and subjective metrics. METHODS: Sleep disruptions for pediatric inpatients admitted prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared. Hand hygiene sensors tracking room entries were utilized to measure objective overnight disruptions for 69 nights pre-pandemic and 154 pandemic nights. Caregiver surveys of overnight disruptions, sleep quantity, and caregiver mood were adopted from validated tools: the Karolinska Sleep Log, Potential Hospital Sleep Disruptions and Noises Questionnaire, and Visual Analog Mood Scale. RESULTS: Nighttime room entries initially decreased 36% (95% CI: 30%, 42%, p < 0.001), then returned towards baseline, mirroring the COVID-19 hospital census. However, surveyed caregivers (n_pre = 293, n_post = 154) reported more disrupted sleep (p < 0.001) due to tests (21% vs. 38%), anxiety (23% vs. 41%), and pain (23% vs. 48%). Caregivers also reported children slept 61 fewer minutes (95% CI: -12 min, -110 min, p < 0.001). Caregivers self-reported feeling more sad, weary, and worse overall (p < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a decrease in objective room entries during the pandemic, caregivers reported their children were disrupted more and slept less. Caregivers also self-reported worse mood.

Greek speaking citizens with permanent residency in Greece above 18 years old were included. A custom questionnaire (DeMask-20) was constructed and validated, which pertained to the perceived difficulty and discomfort when using a facemask. It contained 20 items grouped in 8 subscales (driving, near vision, distance vision, ocular discomfort, role limitation, collaboration, dependency on others, emotional stress). Perceived difficulty and discomfort when using a facemask, compliance and correlations of compliance with DeMask-20 scores, demographics, spectacle and/or contact lens use, and visual acuity were evaluated. RESULTS: The number of factors was determined through factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.716 for the \\"Role limitation\\" subscale to 0.938 for \\"Ocular discomfort\\" subscale. 1,214 participants (402 men, 812 women, mean age 36.7912.50 years) completed the DeMask-20 instrument. Mean DeMask-20 score of all study participants was 3.790.71. Significant differences in DeMask-20 score were detected in gender (p = 0.009), spectacle use (p = 0.034), contact lens use (p = 0.049), and binocular distance visual acuity (bDVA) (p = 0.001). Mean compliance of all participants was 4.050.96. Men, people <50 years and spectacle wearers showed significantly worse compliance (p<0.05). Moreover, professional workers and professional drivers demonstrated significantly better compliance (p = 0.008 and p = 0.047).

AIM: To determine the sensitivity of CXR for lung cancer and to compare stage at diagnosis, time to diagnosis, and survival between those with CXR that detected, or did not detect, lung cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational study using routinely collected healthcare data. METHOD: All patients diagnosed with lung cancer in Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust during 2008C2015 who had a GP-requested CXR in the year before diagnosis were categorised based on the result of the earliest CXR performed in that period. The sensitivity of CXR was calculated and analyses were performed with respect to time to diagnosis, survival, and stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: CXR was negative for 17.7% of patients (n = 376/2129). Median time from initial CXR to diagnosis was 43 days for those with a positive CXR and 204 days for those with a negative CXR.

The review will include studies that recruited individuals aged 16 years sustaining any traumatic event that resulted in one or more musculoskeletal injuries and where a recognised measure for the presence of PTSS symptoms, pain and disability using either validated questionnaires or symptom checklists was employed. The following citation databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, ZETOC, Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar, as well as reference lists from key journals and grey literature, will be searched from inception to 31 November 2021. Two independent reviewers will search, screen studies, extract data and assess risk of bias. The relationship of PTSS, pain and pain-related disability by injury type and severity will be estimated with 95% CI. If possible, study results will be pooled into a meta-analysis. However, if heterogeneity between studies is high, data analyses will be presented descriptively. The overall quality of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval will not be required for this systematic review since only data from existing studies will be used. This review is expected to provide a better understanding of the factors associated with PTSS, pain and pain-related disability following musculoskeletal trauma, and help with the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Results of this review will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and via national and international conferences.

The actual detection of the biogenic amines was on-line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Simultaneously, the psychostimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied by infrared photocell beam detection. The results show that cocaine concurrently and significantly increased synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT (p < 0.004) in VTA. Serotonin changes were accompanied by a notable oscillatory pattern. Importantly, DA and 5-HT changes in VTA were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). Moreover, psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine were significantly increased over control values (p < 0.0001). Psychostimulant behaviors were significantly correlated with concurrently changing synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.01) and also with 5-HT to a lesser degree. Additionally, behavioral data indicate that cocaine may exhibit an anxiolytic effect during acute administration because agoraphobic behavior, as shown by increased central ambulatory behavior, was dramatically reduced by cocaine. Summarily, the present findings show that cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of DA in VTA, an action that is correlated with cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior. The DA-ergic effect appears to be tonically maintained. Furthermore, new findings demonstrate a colocalized, cocaine induced 5-HT-ergic effect in VTA, which keeps pace with cocaine-induced alterations in DA-ergic neurotransmission. Thus, 5-HT may be a relay or a gating mechanism for a DA reward signalling pathway for cocaine.","output":"Cocaine's colocalized effects on synaptic serotonin and dopamine in ventral tegmentum in a reinforcement paradigm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, finding viral nucleic acids on hospital surfaces suggested surfaces could play a role in spread in health care environments. Surface disinfection may interrupt transmission, but few data exist on the effectiveness of health care germicides against coronaviruses on surfaces. METHODS: The efficacy of health care germicides against 2 surrogate coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was tested using the quantitative carrier method on stainless steel surfaces. Germicides were o-phenylphenol/p-tertiary amylphenol) (a phenolic), 70% ethanol, 1:100 sodium hypochlorite, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), instant hand sanitizer (62% ethanol), and hand sanitizing spray (71% ethanol). RESULTS: After 1-minute contact time, for TGEV, there was a log(10) reduction factor of 3.2 for 70% ethanol, 2.0 for phenolic, 2.3 for OPA, 0.35 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 4.0 for 62% ethanol, and 3.5 for 71% ethanol. For MHV, log(10) reduction factors were 3.9 for 70% ethanol, 1.3 for phenolic, 1.7 for OPA, 0.62 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 2.7 for 62% ethanol, and 2.0 for 71% ethanol.

Recently, the activation of immune response to cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) via STING has come to the forefront. Reports show that other proteins outside the STING-TBK1-IRF3 axis respond to CDNs but a global view of impacted proteome in diverse cells is lacking. HGFs are constantly exposed to bacterial-derived cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) and cyclic-di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). AIM: To understand the response of HGFs to bacterial-derived CDNs, we carried out a global proteomics analysis of HGFs treated with c-di-AMP or c-di-GMP. METHODS: The expression levels of several proteins modulated by CDNs were examined. RESULTS: Interferon signaling proteins such as Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 (ISG15), Interferon-induced GTP-binding protein Mx1 (MX1), Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 1 (IFIT1), and (IFIT3) were significantly upregulated. Interestingly, other pathways not fully characterized to be regulated by CDNs, such as necroptosis signaling, iron homeostasis signaling, protein ubiquitination, EIF2 signaling, sumoylation and nucleotide excision repair pathways were also modulated by the bacterial-derived CDNs. CONCLUSION: This study has added to the increasing appreciation that beyond the regulation of cytokine production via STING, cyclic dinucleotides also broadly affect many critical processes in human cells.","output":"Global proteomics of fibroblast cells treated with bacterial cyclic dinucleotides, c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective We aimed to review and analyze cross-sectional abdominal imaging findings in a cohort of 10 patients who had tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Methods This retrospective study conducted from April 1, 2020, to May 13, 2020, involved two institutions that comprised a central tertiary academic institution and multiple smaller community hospitals We reviewed and examined cross-sectional imaging studies of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 either during the emergency room (ER) visit or hospital admission Salient imaging findings and medical records were reviewed Results A total of 10 COVID-19-positive patients (seven males and three females) of ages ranging from 21-75 years underwent cross-sectional abdominopelvic imaging Nine of the 10 patients demonstrated typical lung base findings associated with COVID-19 on both CT and MRI Twelve CT abdominopelvic examinations, one MRI abdomen, and one right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ US) were performed, with three patients undergoing two CT scans during the course of hospitalization Gastric and bowel wall abnormalities were found on 25% (n=3/12) of abdominal CT scans Acute interstitial pancreatitis and acute cholecystitis were both found on one CT exam The remaining (n=7/12, 58%) CT studies demonstrated no acute intraabdominal pathology with incidental findings including fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and splenomegaly Conclusion A spectrum of abdominal imaging findings ranging from colitis to pancreatitis may be correlated with COVID-19 infection, even though the majority of our patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms did not have identifiable GI pathology on imaging","output":"Cross-Sectional Abdominal Imaging Findings in Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered unprecedented expansion of outpatient telemedicine in the United States in all types of health systems, including safety-net health systems. These systems generally serve low-income, racially/ethnically/linguistically diverse patients, many of whom face barriers to digital health access. These patients perspectives are vital to inform ongoing, equitable implementation efforts. METHODS: Twenty-five semi-structured interviews exploring a theoretical framework of technology acceptability were conducted from March through July 2020. Participants had preferred languages of English, Spanish, or Cantonese and were recruited from three clinics (general medicine, obstetrics, and pulmonary) within the San Francisco Health Network. Both deductive and inductive coding were performed. In a secondary analysis, qualitative data were merged with survey data to relate perspectives to demographic factors and technology access/use. RESULTS: Participants were diverse with respect to language (52% non-English-speaking), age (range 23-71), race/ethnicity (24% Asian, 20% Black, 44% Hispanic/Latinx, 12% White), & smartphone use (80% daily, 20% weekly or less). All but 2 had a recent telemedicine visit (83% telephone). Qualitative results revealed that most participants felt telemedicine visits fulfilled their medical needs, were convenient, and were satisfied with their telemedicine care. However, most still preferred in-person visits, expressing concern that tele-visits relied on patients abilities to access telemedicine, as well as monitor and manage their own health without in-person physical evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: High satisfaction with telemedicine can co-exist with patient-expressed hesitations surrounding the perceived effectiveness, self-efficacy, and digital access barriers associated with a new model of care. More research is needed to guide how healthcare systems and clinicians make decisions and communicate about visit modalities to support high-quality care that responds to patients needs and circumstances.

Surgical resection is often indicated for symptomatic lesions but may result in new neurological deficits and decrease quality of life. Identifying predictors of these adverse outcomes may help target interventions designed to reduce their occurrence. Nonetheless, most prior studies have employed population-level datasets with limited granularity. PURPOSE To determine independent predictors of nonroutine discharge, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmission and reoperation, and to deploy these results as a web-based calculator. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study Patient Sample: 235 patients who underwent resection of IMSCTs at a single comprehensive cancer center. OUTCOME MEASURES Nonroutine discharge, prolonged LOS, 30-day readmission, and 30-day reoperation Methods: Patients who underwent surgery from June 2002-May 2020 at a single tertiary center were included. Data was collected on patient demographics, clinical presentation, tumor histology, surgical procedures, and 30-day readmission and reoperation. Functional status was assessed using the Modified McCormick Scale (MMS) and queried preoperative neurological symptoms included weakness, urinary and bowel dysfunction, numbness, and back and radicular pain. Variables significant on univariable analysis at the   0.15 level were entered into a stepwise multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS Of 235 included cases, 131 (56%) experienced a nonhome discharge and 68 (29%) experienced a prolonged LOS. Of 178 patients with  30 days of follow-up, 17 (9.6%) were readmitted within 30-days and 13 (7.4%) underwent reoperation. Wound dehiscence (29%) was the most common reason for readmission. Nonhome discharge was independently predicted by older age (OR=1.03/year; p<0.01), thoracic location of the tumor (OR=2.36; p=0.01), presenting with bowel dysfunction (OR=4.09; p=0.03), and longer incision length (OR=1.44 per level; p=0.03). Independent predictors of prolonged LOS included presenting with urinary incontinence (OR=2.65; p=0.05) or a higher preoperative white blood cell count (OR=1.08 per 103/L); p=0.01), while GTR predicted shorter LOS (OR=0.40; p=0.02). Independent predictive factors for 30-day unplanned readmission included experiencing 1 complications during the first hospitalization (OR=6.13; p<0.01) and having a poor (A-C) versus good (D-E) baseline neurological status on the ASIA impairment scale (OR=0.23; p=0.03). The only independent predictor of unplanned 30-day reoperation was experiencing 1 inpatient complications during the index hospitalization (OR=6.92; p<0.01). Receiver operating curves for the constructed models produced C-statistics of 0.67-0.77 and the models were deployed as freely available web-based calculators (https://jhuspine5.shinyapps.io/Intramedullary30day/). CONCLUSIONS We found that neurological presentation, patient demographics, and incision length were important predictors of adverse perioperative outcomes in patients with IMSCTs. The calculators can be used by clinicians for risk stratification, preoperative counseling, and targeted interventions.","output":"A Novel Online Calculator to Predict Nonroutine Discharge, Length of Stay, Readmission, and Reoperation in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Intramedullary Spinal Cord Tumors: Intramedullary tumors calculator."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background During COVID-19 pandemic safety of disease modifying treatments (DMT) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is still under debate.

Conclusion This case raises the question whether SARS-CoV-2 might trigger disease reactivation as other viral infections were described to potentially trigger MS relapses. Furthermore, it reinforces the discussion on MS treatment during COVID-19 pandemic and shows the challenge of weighing up the elevated risk of COVID-19 and of severe MS relapse when interrupting an effective DMT.","output":"SARS-CoV2 infection as a potential trigger for severe relapse in a patient with multiple sclerosis who stopped disease modifying treatment due to COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen (u-Ag) testing has recently gained attention in the early diagnosis of severe and critical acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2/pneumococcal co-infection. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, in order to assess whether pneumococcal co-infection is associated with different mortality rate and hospital stay in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Charts, protocols, mortality, and hospitalization data of a consecutive series of COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in northern Italy during COVID-19 outbreak were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing to detect an underlying pneumococcal co-infection. Covid19+/u-Ag+ and Covid19+/u-Ag- patients were compared in terms of overall survival and length of hospital stay using chi-square test and survival analysis. RESULTS: Out of 575 patients with documented pneumonia, 13% screened positive for the u-Ag test. All u-Ag+ patients underwent treatment with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin or Levofloxacin. Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Darunavir/Cobicistat were added in 44 patients, and hydroxychloroquine and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in 47 and 33 patients, respectively. All u-Ag+ patients were hospitalized. Mortality was 15.4% and 25.9% in u-Ag+ and u-Ag- patients, respectively (p = 0.09). Survival analysis showed a better prognosis, albeit not significant, in u-Ag+ patients. Median hospital stay did not differ among groups (10 vs. 9 days, p = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing helped to better target antibiotic therapy with a final trend of reduction in mortality of u-Ag+ COVID-19 patients having a concomitant pneumococcal infection.

The use of xenogeneic proteinCfree Good Manufacturing PracticeCcompliant growth media is a prerequisite for clinical MSC isolation and expansion. Human platelet lysate (HPL) has been efficiently implemented into MSC clinical manufacturing as a substitute for fetal bovine serum (FBS). Because the use of human-derived blood materials alleviates immunologic risks but not the transmission of blood-borne viruses, the aim of our study was to test an even safer alternative than HPL to FBS: HPL subjected to pathogen inactivation by psoralen (iHPL). Methods Bone marrow samples were plated and expanded in -minimum essential medium with 10% of three culture supplements: HPL, iHPL and FBS, at the same time. MSC morphology, growth and immunophenotype were analyzed at each passage. Karyotype, tumorigenicity and sterility were analyzed at the third passage. Statistical analyses were performed. Results The MSCs cultivated in the three different culture conditions showed no significant differences in terms of fibroblast colony-forming unit number, immunophenotype or in their multipotent capacity. Conversely, the HPL/iHPL-MSCs were smaller, more numerous, had a higher proliferative potential and showed a higher Oct-3/4 and NANOG protein expression than did FBS-MSCs. Although HPL/iHPL-MSCs exhibit characteristics that may be attributable to a higher primitive stemness than FBS-MSCs, no tumorigenic mutations or karyotype modifications were observed. Conclusions We demonstrated that iHPL is safer than HPL and represents a good, Good Manufacturing PracticeCcompliant alternative to FBS for MSC clinical production that is even more advantageous in terms of cellular growth and stemness.","output":"Inactivated human platelet lysate with psoralen: a new perspective for mesenchymal stromal cell production in Good Manufacturing Practice conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The high prevalence of COVID-19 has been paied lots of attention all over the world.

The One Health approach, which considers the linkages between the health of people, animals, and their shared environment, presents opportunities to reduce these impacts through a more holistic coordinated strategy to understanding and mitigating disease risks. Understanding the linkages between animal, human, and environmental health risks and outcomes is critical for developing early detection systems and risk reduction strategies to address known and novel zoonotic disease threats. Nearly 70 countries across the world, including Ghana, have signed on to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which is facilitating multisectoral approaches to strengthen country capacities in the prevention and early detection of and respond to infectious disease threats. Currently, Ghana has not yet formalized a national One Health policy. The lack of a clearly defined multisectoral platform and limited collaboration among key Ghanaian Ministries, Departments, and Agencies has impacted the country's ability to effectively mitigate and respond to emerging and reemerging zoonoses.

The goal of this study was to use scenario tree modeling to assess the sensitivity of Ecuador's current national surveillance system to human leptospirosis as the basis for an economic assessment of the system. We created a decision-tree model to analyze the current system's sensitivity. The inputs were described as probabilities distributions, and the model assessed the program's sensitivity as an output. The model also considers the geographical and weather variations across Ecuador's three continental regions: Andean, Amazonia, and the Coast. Several data sources were used to create the model, including leptospirosis records from Ecuador's Ministry of Public Health, national and international literature, and expert elicitation, all of which were incorporated in a Bayesian framework. We were able to determine the most critical parameters influencing each scenario's output (CSU) sensitivity through sensitivity analysis. The Coast region had the best sensitivity scenario, with a median of 0.85% (IC 95% 0.41-0.99), followed by the Amazonia with a median of 0.54% (CI 95% 0.18-0.99) and the Andes with a median of 0.29% (CI 95% 0.02-0.89).

RESULTS: The expression stability of 16 reference genes under fluconazole stress was evaluated using fold change and standard deviation computations with the hkgFinder tool. Our data revealed that the mRNA expression levels of three ribosomal RNAs (RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25) remained stable in response to fluconazole, while PGK1, UBC7, and UBC13 mRNAs showed only approximately 2.9-, 3.0-, and 2.5-fold induction by azole, respectively. By contrast, mRNA levels of the other 10 reference genes (ACT1, EF1, GAPDH, PPIA, RPL2A, RPL10, RPL13A, SDHA, TUB1, and UBC4) were dramatically increased in C. glabrata following antifungal treatment, exhibiting changes ranging from 4.5- to 32.7-fold.

The stability rankings of the reference genes by geNorm and the 2(-CT) method were identical to those by hkgFinder, whereas the stability rankings by BestKeeper and NormFinder were notably different. We then validated the suitability of six candidate reference genes (ACT1, PGK1, RDN5.8, RDN18, UBC7, and UBC13) as internal controls for ten target genes in this system using the comparative C(T) method. Our validation experiments passed for all six reference genes analyzed except RDN18, where the amplification efficiency of RDN18 was different from that of the ten target genes. Finally, we demonstrated that the relative quantification of target gene expression varied according to the endogenous control used, highlighting the importance of the choice of internal controls in such experiments. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of RDN5.8, UBC13, and PGK1 alone or the combination of RDN5.8 plus UBC13 or PGK1 as reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in C. glabrata following azole treatment. In contrast, we show that ACT1 and other commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, PPIA, RPL13A, TUB1, etc.) were not validated as good internal controls in the current model.","output":"Evaluation of reference genes for real-time quantitative PCR studies in Candida glabrata following azole treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are the simplest of pathogens, but possess sophisticated molecular mechanisms to manipulate host behavior, frequently utilizing molecular mimicry. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been shown to bind to the host receptor neuropilin-1 in order to gain entry into the cell. To do this, the virus utilizes its spike protein polybasic cleavage site (PCS), which mimics the CendR motif of neuropilin-1s endogenous ligands. In addition to facilitating cell entry, binding to neuropilin-1 has analgesic effects. We discuss the potential impact of neuropilin-1 binding by SARS-CoV-2 in ameliorating sickness behavior of the host, and identify a convergent evolutionary strategy of PCS cleavage and subsequent neuropilin binding in other human viruses. In addition, we discuss the evolutionary leap of the ancestor of SARS-COV-2, which involved acquisition of the PCS thus faciliting binding to the neuropilin-1 receptor. Acquisition of the PCS by the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 appears to have led to pleiotropic beneficial effects including enhancement of cell entry via binding to ACE2, facilitation of cell entry via binding to neuropilin-1, promotion of analgesia, and potentially the formation of decoy epitopes via enhanced shedding of the S1 subunit. Lastly, other potential neuromanipulation strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 are discussed, including interferon suppression and the resulting reduction in sickness behavior, enhanced transmission through neurally mediated cough induction, and reduction in sense of smell.","output":"Host Manipulation Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for systematic drug repurposing has seen a steady increase over the past decade and may be particularly valuable to quickly remedy unexpected pandemics.

In this observational study, we identified factors associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia following hip and knee replacement. PATIENTS AND METHODS We prospectively monitored changes in glucose following primary hip and knee replacements in 191 patients with osteoarthritis. Possible associations of patient characteristics and operation-related factors with hyperglycemia (defined as glucose > 7.8 mmol/L in 2 consecutive measurements) and severe hyperglycemia (glucose > 10 mmol/L) were analyzed using binary logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, operated joint, and anesthesiological risk score. RESULTS 76 patients (40%) developed hyperglycemia, and 48 of them (25% of the whole cohort) had severe hyperglycemia. Glycemic responses were similar following hip replacement and knee replacement. Previously diagnosed diabetes was associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia and severe hyperglycemia, compared to patients with normal glucose metabolism, whereas newly diagnosed diabetes and milder glucose metabolism disorders had no effect. In patients without previously diagnosed diabetes, increased values of preoperative glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose on the day of operation were associated with hyperglycemia. Higher anesthesiological risk score-but none of the operation-related factors analyzed-was associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia. INTERPRETATION Perioperative hyperglycemia is common in primary hip and knee replacements. Previously diagnosed diabetes is the strongest risk factor for hyperglycemia. In patients with no history of diabetes, preoperative HbA1c and fasting glucose on the day of operation can be used to stratify the risk of hyperglycemia.","output":"Risk factors for perioperative hyperglycemia in primary hip and knee replacements."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has now infected 15 million people and produced more than six hundred thousand deaths around the world. Due to high transmission levels, many governments implemented social distancing and confinement measures with different levels of required compliance to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. In several countries, these measures were effective, and it was possible to flatten the epidemic curve and control it. In others, this objective was not or has not been achieved. In far too many cities around the world, rebounds of the epidemic are occurring or, in others, plateaulike states have appeared, where high incidence rates remain constant for relatively long periods of time. Nonetheless, faced with the challenge of urgent social need to reactivate their economies, many countries have decided to lift mitigation measures at times of high incidence. In this paper, we use a mathematical model to characterize the impact of short duration transmission events within the confinement period previous but close to the epidemic peak. The model also describes the possible consequences on the disease dynamics after mitigation measures are lifted. We use Mexico City as a case study. The results show that events of high mobility may produce either a later higher peak, a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence or the same peak as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay. Finally, we also show the importance of carefully timing the lifting of mitigation measures. If this occurs during a period of high incidence, then the disease transmission will rapidly increase, unless the effective contact rate keeps decreasing, which will be very difficult to achieve once the population is released.","output":"Lifting mobility restrictions and the effect of superspreading events on the short-term dynamics of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic would have particularly affected acute stroke care. However, its impact is clearly inherent to the local stroke network conditions. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on acute stroke care in the Lyon comprehensive stroke center during this period. METHODS: We conducted a prospective data collection of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and/or mechanical thrombectomy (MT) during the COVID-19 period (from 29/02/2020 to 10/05/2020) and a control period (from 29/02/2019 to 10/05/2019). The volume of reperfusion therapies and pre and intra-hospital delays were compared during both periods. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients were included. The volume of IVT significantly decreased during the COVID-period [55 (54.5%) vs 74 (69.2%); p = 0.03]. The volume of MT remains stable over the two periods [72 (71.3%) vs 65 (60.8%); p = 0.14], but the door-to-groin puncture time increased in patients transferred for MT (237 [187C339] vs 210 [163C260]; p < 0.01). The daily number of Emergency Medical Dispatch calls considerably increased (1502 [1133C2238] vs 1023 [960C1410]; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a decrease in the volume of IVT, whereas the volume of MT remained stable although intra-hospital delays increased for transferred patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One-hundred and sixtytwo intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients in a tertiary level hospital in the city of Buenos Aires with COVID-19 diagnosis were included. We hypothesized that COVID-19 related AKI would develop in the period of more severe hypoxemia as an early event and late AKI would be more probably related to intensive care unit complications. For this purpose, we divided subjects into two groups: those with early AKI and late AKI, before and after day 14 from symptom onset, respectively. A stepwise multivariate analysis was conducted to find possible AKI predictors. AKI incidence was 43.2% (n = 70) of the total patients admitted into ICU with severe COVID-19, 11.1% (n = 18) required renal replacement therapy. In-hospital mortality was higher (58.6%) for the AKI group. AKI occurred on a median time of 10 (IQR 5.5-17.5) days from symptom onset. A history of hypertension or heart failure, age and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) requirement were identified as risk factors. Late AKI (n = 25, 35.7%) was associated with sepsis and nephrotoxic exposure, whereas early AKI occurred closer to the timing of IMV initiation and was more likely to have an unknown origin.

This system identifies at minimum 4 orders of contact: first order, the community; second order, prehospital; third order, facility; and fourth order, regional level. Adopting this approach will ensure that disaster response activities will occur in a comprehensive fashion that minimizes the patient care burden at each subsequent order of intervention and reduces the overall need to ration care.

METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using deidentified data from the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (ACCN) open-access Facebook page, January 28 to April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Two major themes were identified: (1) \\"sharing and seeking evidence,\\" that is, nurses used both formal and informal sources to explore evidence supporting evolving clinical practices, and (2) \\"concerns about evidence,\\" that is, nurses expressed concerns about lack of evidence and mistrust of evolving evidence. DISCUSSION: Initially, there was a mismatch in nurses' expectations of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses Facebook page. A major limitation of Facebook is the lack of a repository for quick retrieval of information. Despite these limitations, and fear and mistrust of changing guidelines, social media was used to communicate, collaborate, and share evidence to support clinical practice. Critical care nurses seemed to value evidence to support patient management and their personal safety during this evolving health crisis.

From published data, we calculated estimates for how the following strategies may affect the time to clear the backlog of patients waiting for treatment and the associated waiting list mortality. Interventions: 1) increasing the capacity for the treatment of severe AS, 2) converting proportions of cases from surgery to transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and 3) a combination of these two. Results: In a capacitated system, clearing the backlog by returning to pre-COVID-19 capacity is not possible. A conversion rate of 50% would clear the backlog within 666 (95% CI, 533-848) days with 1419 (95% CI, 597-2189) deaths whilst waiting during this time. A 20% capacity increase would require 535 (95% CI, 434-666) days, with an associated mortality of 1172 (95% CI, 466-1859).

Among these, there is a long history of infectious diseases that have spread from non-human primates (NHP) to humans. For millennia, indigenous groups that depend on wildlife for their survival were exposed to the risk of NHP pathogens' transmission through animal hunting and wild meat consumption. Usually, exposure is of no consequence or is limited to mild infections. In rare situations, it can be more severe or even become a real public health concern. Since the emergence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), nobody can ignore that an emerging infectious diseases (EID) might spread from NHP into the human population. In large parts of Central Africa and Asia, wildlife remains the primary source of meat and income for millions of people living in rural areas. However, in the past few decades the risk of exposure to an NHP pathogen has taken on a new dimension. Unprecedented breaking down of natural barriers between NHP and humans has increased exposure to health risks for a much larger population, including people living in urban areas. There are several reasons for this: (i) due to road development and massive destruction of ecosystems for agricultural needs, wildlife and humans come into contact more frequently; (ii) due to ecological awareness, many long distance travelers are in search of wildlife discovery, with a particular fascination for African great apes; (iii) due to the attraction for ancient temples and mystical practices, others travelers visit Asian places colonized by NHP. In each case, there is a risk of pathogen transmission through a bite or another route of infection. Beside the individual risk of contracting a pathogen, there is also the possibility of starting a new pandemic. This article reviews the known cases of NHP pathogens' transmission to humans whether they are hunters, travelers, ecotourists, veterinarians, or scientists working on NHP. Although pathogen transmission is supposed to be a rare outcome, Rabies virus, Herpes B virus, Monkeypox virus, Ebola virus, or Yellow fever virus infections are of greater concern and require quick countermeasures from public health professionals.","output":"Infectious Disease Risk Across the Growing Human-Non Human Primate Interface: A Review of the Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global value chains (GVCs) have entered a new stage of restructuring characterized by trends towards localization, regionalization and diversification. These trends can be attributed to the evolution of the international division, irrational responses to crisis shocks, and trade protectionism. In this context, China 's industrial and supply chain upgrades face both opportunities and challenges which require navigating the adverse effects of industrial re-shoring, unfair technology competition, and changes in the global industrial layout. Yet, such challenges may create pressures for China to accelerate innovation, overcome the low-end lock-up effect by creating regional value chains, and broaden international cooperation. China needs to explore an effective strategy to defuse risks and seize opportunities. On one hand, China should influence the restructuring of GVCs evolution and strengthen its supply chains by playing an active role in economic globalization and the international division. On the other hand, China should proactively respond to GVCs restructuring amid rising trade protectionism, defuse risks from trade protectionism by opening wider to the outside world, and strive to upgrade industrial and supply chains while enhancing the security and stability of their nation.","output":"Global Value Chain Restructuring: Challenges, Opportunities and Strategies for China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order for the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R(0) of 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22, and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days, and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57%, and it is 2.37% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 vs. 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 vs. 0.57%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing, and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.","output":"A Simulation of a COVID-19 Epidemic Based on a Deterministic SEIR Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is involved in energy dissipation and has been linked to weight loss, insulin sensitivity, and reduced risk of atherosclerotic disease.

PML is caused by the JC virus (JCV), a neurotropic DNA polyomavirus that infects oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, causing inflammation and demyelination which lead to neurological dysfunction. The pathogenesis of PML is poorly understood due to the lack of in vitro or animal models to study mechanisms of disease as the virus most efficiently infects only human cells. We developed a human-derived brain organotypic system (also called brain organoid) to model JCV infection. The model was developed by using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and culturing them in 3D to generate an organotypic model containing neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes which recapitulates aspects of the environment of the human brain. We infected the brain organoids with the JCV MAD4 strain or cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with PML. The organoids were assessed for evidence of infection by qPCR, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy at 1, 2, and 3 weeks post-exposure. JCV infection in both JCV MAD4 strain and PML CSF-exposed brain organoids was confirmed by immunocytochemical studies demonstrating viral antigens and electron microscopy showing virion particles in the nuclear compartment of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. No evidence of neuronal infection was visualized. Infection was also demonstrated by JCV qPCR in the virus-exposed organoids and their media. In conclusion, the brain organoid model of JCV infection establishes a human model suitable for studying the mechanisms of JCV infection and pathogenesis of PML and may facilitate the exploration of therapeutic approaches.","output":"A human-derived 3D brain organoid model to study JC virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors are pivotal in recovery after acute orthopedic traumatic injuries. Addressing psychosocial factors is an important opportunity for preventing persistent pain and disability. We aim to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of psychosocial care within outpatient orthopedic trauma settings using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Proctors taxonomy of implementation outcomes, and to provide implementation strategies derived from qualitative data and supplemented by the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change. METHODS: We conducted live video qualitative focus groups, exit interviews and individual interviews with stakeholders within 3 geographically diverse level 1 trauma settings (N = 79; 20 attendings, 28 residents, 10 nurses, 13 medical assistants, 5 physical therapists/social workers, and 3 fellows) at 3 trauma centers in Texas, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. We used directed and conventional content analyses to derive information on barriers, facilitators, and implementation strategies within 26 CFIR constructs nested within 3 relevant Proctor outcomes of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. RESULTS: Stakeholders noted that implementing psychosocial care within their practice can be acceptable, appropriate, and feasible. Many perceived integrated psychosocial care as crucial for preventing persistent pain and reducing provider burden, noting they lack the time and specialized training to address patients psychosocial needs. Providers suggested strategies for integrating psychosocial care within orthopedic settings, including obtaining buy-in from leadership, providing concise and data-driven education to providers, bypassing stigma, and flexibly adapting to fast-paced clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide a blueprint for successful implementation of psychosocial care in orthopedic trauma settings, with important implications for prevention of persistent pain and disability.

The potential prothrombotic action of the SARS-CoV-2 is supported by the topographical involvement of the lung regions with a predilection for the lower lobe with peripheral involvement.

The nucleocapsid (N) proteins of CoVs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where the viruses replicate, but in some cases the proteins are partially located in the nucleolus. Many studies have investigated the subcellular localization and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals of the CoV N proteins, but little is known about ToV N proteins. Here, we studied the subcellular localization of the bovine ToV (BToV) N protein (BToN) and characterized its nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals. Unlike other CoVs, BToN in infected cells was transported mainly to the nucleolus during early infection but was distributed predominantly in the nucleoplasm rather than in the nucleolus during late infection. Interestingly, a small quantity of BToN was detected in the cytoplasm during infection. Examination of a comprehensive set of substitution or deletion mutants of BToN fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) revealed that clusters of arginine (R) residues comprise nuclear/nucleolar localization signals (NLS/NoLS), and the C-terminal region served as a chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-independent nuclear export signal (NES). Moreover, recombinant viruses with mutations in the NLS/NoLS, but retaining nuclear accumulation, were successfully rescued and showed slightly reduced growth ability, while the virus that lost the NLS/NoLS-mediated nuclear accumulation of BToN was not rescued. These results indicate that BToN uniquely accumulates mainly in nuclear compartments during infection, regulated by an R-rich NLS/NoLS and a CRM1-independent NES, and that the BToN accumulation in the nuclear compartment driven by NLS/NoLS is important for virus growth.IMPORTANCE ToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens detected in many species, including humans. BToV has spread worldwide, leading to economic loss, and there is currently no treatment or vaccine available. Positive-stranded RNA viruses, including ToVs, replicate in the cytoplasm, and their structural proteins generally accumulate in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, BToN accumulated predominantly in the nucleus/nucleolus during all infectious processes, with only a small fraction accumulating in the cytoplasm despite being a major structural protein. Furthermore, we identified unique nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals and demonstrated the importance of NLS/NoLS for virus growth. This study is the first to undertake an in-depth investigation of the subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking signals of BToN. Our findings additionally suggest that the NLS/NoLS-mediated nuclear accumulation of BToN is important for virus replication. An understanding of the unique features of BToV may provide novel insights into the assembly mechanisms of not only ToVs but also other positive-stranded RNA viruses.","output":"Characterization of Localization and Export Signals of Bovine Torovirus Nucleocapsid Protein Responsible for Extensive Nuclear and Nucleolar Accumulation and Their Importance for Virus Growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne particulate matter (PM) pollutants, especially with nanoscale size, have caused serious public health issues.

Individual and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 nurses, and conventional content analysis was used to categorize the data. In the care of COVID-19 patients, CBC consisted of three categories including pro-social behaviors, paying attention to the beliefs and values of patients, and concern for family members. The first category had three subcategories including empathy, altruism, and helping in critical situations. The second category included the subcategories of the spiritual approach to care and respect for cultural aspects. The third category, concern for family members, had one subcategory: the need to consider the patient's family. Our findings may help to develop a comprehensive model in COVID-19 care according to which, in addition to routine patient care, nurses will consider concepts such as empathy, altruism, helping in critical situations, spirituality, cultural values, and the familys needs at the end of the patient's life.

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry mechanisms used by different viruses.","output":"Structure of mouse coronavirus spike protein complexed with receptor reveals mechanism for viral entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ma's research shows N95 masks, medical masks, even homemade masks could block at least 90% of the virus in aerosols(1).

Different studies have been carried out to evaluate experiences of online migration and study its effect on stakeholders in education. This paper is aimed to rationally evaluate the transition to online learning in PNU from the student perspective. Five thousand ten student responses to an online survey were collected. The survey results indicate that the majority of students were satisfied by the quality of the delivered courses during this crisis period as they have received adequate support from instructors, IT, and leaders. Moreover, student satisfaction can be explained by the readiness and preparedness of PNU for such circumstances. Indeed, students and instructors are poised to adopt new learning modalities as they were familiar with new technologies and innovation in learning and teaching so far. ? 2021 IGI Global.

The virus causing COVID-19 was related to a coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The virus caused an epidemic in China and was quickly contained in 2003. Although coming from the same family of viruses and sharing certain transmissibility factors, the local health institutions in China had no experience with this new virus, subsequently named SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on their prior experience with the 2003 SARS epidemic, health authorities in China recognized the need for personal protective equipment (PPE). Existing PPE and protocols were limited and reflected early experience with SARS; however, as additional PPE supplies became available, designated COVID-19 hospitals in Hubei Province adopted the World Health Organization guidelines for Ebola to create a protocol specific for treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This article describes the PPE and protocol for its safe and effective deployment and the implementation of designated hospital units for COVID-19 patients. To date, only two nurses working in China who contracted SARS-CoV-2 have died from COVID-19 in the early period of the epidemic (February 11 and 14, 2020).

The significance of Ct values in epidemiological studies and large cohorts is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To monitor Ct values in a long-term study and compare the results with demographic data of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. STUDY DESIGN: S gene SARS-CoV-2 Ct values were analyzed retrospectively from consecutive patients between March 15th to September 15th 2020 with special regard to age, gender, and in- or outpatient status. RESULTS: In total, 65,878 patients were tested, 1103 (1.7 %) of whom were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-six positive patients were excluded, because the respective PCR runs did not meet the stability requirements (Ct value of the positive controls between 26 and 29). Of the remaining 1077 patients, females (n = 566; 53 %) were significantly older than males (n = 511; 47 %) (50.9 versus 45.1 years; p = 0.006) and had slightly higher mean Ct values than males (25.4 vs. 24.8; p = 0.04).

In a broadest sense, the term IoT encompasses everything connected to the internet, but it is increasingly being used to define objects that \\"talk\\" to each other, creating a network from simple sensors to smartphones and wearables connected. During the recent years this network of communicating devices has been combined with other technological achievements, and particularly with the Virtual Reality (VR)2 and the Artificial Intelligence (AI).3 The emerge of COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, resulted to the poor response and healthcare failures of many countries globally.4 One of the main reasons for such a failure, was the inability of accurate data collection from different sources. Apparently, it was the first time, humanity realized the need for massive amounts of heterogeneous data to be collected, interpreted, and shared. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several innovators and public authorities are looking to leverage IoT tools to reduce the burden on the healthcare systems.5 Mental health is one of the areas that seems to benefit the most of such technologies. A significant decrease of the total amount of ER visits and a dramatic increase of internet access from the patients and care givers along to the development of applications for mental health issues, followed the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.6 Such technologies proved to be efficient to help mentally ill patients and pioneer the path in the future. Probably the most obvious use of these emerged technologies is the improvement of the telehealth options. Patients who suffer from mental illness face significant problems towards the continuity of care during the crisis.7 Nonetheless, they usually have other health problems, that deprive them from an equitable health care provision. Improved telehealth platforms can give them a single point access to address all their problems. The use of electronic health records can reduce the fragmentary health services and improve the outcome.8 However, this is only the beginning. The COVID-19 crisis and the subsequent social isolation, to reduce both the contamination and the spread of the disease, highlighted the necessity for providing accurate and secure diagnoses and treatments from a safe distance. Virtual reality combined with IoT and AI technologies seem to be a reliable alternative to the classic physical and mental examination and treatment in many areas of mental and neurological diseases.2 These novel techniques can spot the early signs and detect mental illnesses with high accuracy. However, caution and more work are required to bridge the space between these recently thrived technologies and mental health care.7 It is worth mentioning, that internet-oriented health care procedures can also help to reduce the gaps caused by the stigma of mental illness. For example, the development of AI chatbots (an application used to chat directly with a human) can alleviate the fears of judgment of the help seeking persons and provide the professionals with a supplemental support toward improved services to their patients.9 A final remark for conclusion.

In medical environments that use traditional hermetic ventilation systems, medical personnel who come in contact with patients are more susceptible to infection compared to regular staff; therefore, the air flow and air quality of hermetic negative pressure isolation wards are highly critical. For this purpose, the study proposes a full-outer-air-intake natural air-conditioning system for negative pressure isolation wards.

SARS-CoV-2 infection of cultured cells is accompanied by elevated glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial function, whereas 2DG represses glycolysis and stimulates respiration, and restricts viral replication. While 2DG has pleiotropic effects on cell metabolism in cultured cells it is not known which of these manifests in vivo. On the other hand, it is known that 2DG given continuously can have severe detrimental effects on the rodent heart. Here, we show that the principal effect of an extended, intermittent 2DG treatment on mice is to augment the mitochondrial respiratory chain proteome in the heart; importantly, this occurs without vacuolization, hypertrophy or fibrosis. The increase in the heart respiratory chain proteome suggests an increase in mitochondrial oxidative capacity, which could compensate for the energy deficit caused by the inhibition of glycolysis. Thus, 2DG in the murine heart appears to induce a metabolic configuration that is the opposite of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, which could explain the compounds ability to restrict the propagation of the virus to the benefit of patients with COVID-19 disease.","output":"2 deoxy-D-glucose augments the mitochondrial respiratory chain in heart"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we investigate the extent to which the presence of a large meatpacking (i.e., beef, pork, and broiler chicken) plant has affected county-level COVID-19 transmission dynamics.

AIM: Conduct a seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies in Irish GP clinics. DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants were 172 staff and 799 patients of 15 general practices in the Midwest region of Ireland. METHODS: This seroprevalence study utilised 2 manufacturers' point-of-care (POC) SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG combined antibody tests, offered to patients and staff in general practice from mid-June to mid-July 2020. RESULTS: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) seroprevalence was 12.6% in patients attending general practice and 11.1% in staff working in general practice, with administrative staff having the lowest seroprevalence at 2.5% and nursing staff having the highest at 17.6%. Previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 and history of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test were associated with higher seroprevalence. IgG antibodies were detected in approximately 80% of participants who had a previous PCR-confirmed infection. Average length of time between participants' positive PCR test and positive IgG antibody test was 83 days. CONCLUSION: Patients and healthcare staff in general practice in Ireland had relatively high rates of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 compared to the national average at the time (1.7%). Four-fifths of participants with a history of confirmed COVID-19 disease still had detectable antibodies an average of 12 weeks post-infection.

Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to filter PHI and GHI articles from the larger biomedical informatics domain. Articles were identified using MEDLINE as well as personal bibliographies from members of the American Medical Informatics Association PHI and GHI working groups. Results: A total of 85 PHI articles and 282 GHI articles were identified. While systems in PHI continue to support surveillance activities, we identified a shift towards support for prevention, environmental health, and public health care services. Furthermore, articles from the U.S. reveal a shift towards PHI applications at state and local levels. GHI articles focused on telemedicine, mHealth and eHealth applications.

Without monitoring, effective control and prevention is difficult. We looked at a software system (a) used in shelters across the United States to determine if it can be used to track URI frequency and risk factors in a population. Reports from the software system (a) were compared to data collected manually. This showed that data currently collected were not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors. However, potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases. ABSTRACT: ObjectiveFeline upper respiratory infection (URI) is a common, multi-factorial infectious disease syndrome endemic to many animal shelters. Although a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in shelter cats, URI is seldom formally monitored in shelter cat populations. Without monitoring, effective control and prevention of this often endemic disease is difficult. We looked at an integrated case management software system (a) for animal care organizations, widely used in shelters across the United States. Shelter staff routinely enter information regarding individual animals and disease status, but do not commonly use the software system to track frequency of disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if the software system (a) can be used to track URI frequency and selected risk factors in a population, and to evaluate the quality and completeness of the data as currently collected in a shelter. Design (type of study)Descriptive Survey. Animals (or Sample)317 cats in an animal shelter. ProceduresReports from the software system (a) containing data regarding daily inventory, daily intake, animal identification, location, age, vaccination status, URI diagnosis and URI duration were evaluated. The reports were compared to data collected manually by an observer (Ann Therese Kommedal) to assess discrepancies, completeness, timeliness, availability and accuracy. Data were collected 6 days a week over a 4 week period. ResultsComparisons between the software system (a) reports and manually collected reports showed that 93% of inventory reports were complete and of these 99% were accurate. Fifty-two percent of the vaccination reports were complete, of which 97% were accurate. The accuracy of the software systems age reports was 76%. Two-hundred and twenty-three cats were assigned a positive or negative URI diagnosis by the observer. The predictive value of the URI status in the software system (a) was below 60% both for positive and negative URI diagnosis. Conclusions and Clinical Relevancedata currently collected and entered into the software systems in the study shelter, was not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors, due to issues with both data quality and capture. However, the potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases.

Despite the importance of NPI, their implementation has been monitored in an ad hoc and uncoordinated manner, mainly through the manual efforts of volunteers. Given the absence of systematic NPI tracking, authorities and researchers are limited in their ability to quantify the effectiveness of NPI and guide decisions regarding their use during the progression of a global pandemic. To address this issue, we propose 3-stage machine learning framework called EpiTopics to facilitate the surveillance of NPI by mining the vast amount of unlabelled news reports about these interventions. Building on topic modeling, our method characterizes online government reports and media articles related to COVID-19 as a mixture of latent topics. Our key contribution is the use of transfer-learning to address the limited number of NPI-labelled documents and topic modelling to support interpretation of the results. At stage 1, we trained a modified version of the unsupervised dynamic embedded topic model (DETM) on 1.2 million international news reports related to COVID-19. At stage 2, we used the trained DETM to infer topic mixture from a small set of 2000 NPI-labelled WHO documents as the input features for predicting NPI labels on each document. At stage 3, we supply the inferred country-level temporal topics from the DETM to the pretrained document-level NPI classifier to predict country-level NPIs. We identified 25 interpretable topics, over 4 distinct and coherent COVID-related themes. These topics contributed to significant improvements in predicting the NPIs labelled in the WHO documents and in predicting country-level NPIs. Together, our work lay the machine learning methodological foundation for future research in global-scale surveillance of public health interventions.

METHODS 30 depressed patients of mean age 23.41 (+/- 5.77) years, and 68 controls patients of mean age 25.08 (+/- 11.42) years, entered the study. In 18 of them, the instrument was re-applied 1-2 days later and the Translation and Back Translation made. Clinical diagnosis was reached with the use of the SCAN v.2.0 and the International Personality Disorders Examination (IPDE). The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and the Zung Depression Rating Scale (ZDRS) were applied for cross-validation purposes. Statistical analysis included ANOVA, the Spearman Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, Principal Components Analysis and the calculation of Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS Sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 and 0.94, respectively, at 26/27. Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was equal to 0.89. The Spearman's rho between MDI and CES-D was 0.86 and between MDI and ZDRS was 0.76. The factor analysis revealed two factors but the first accounted for 54% of variance while the second only for 9%.

Deep learning has a potential to automate this task but requires a large set of high-quality annotations that are difficult to collect. Learning from noisy training labels that are easier to obtain has a potential to alleviate this problem. To this end, we propose a novel noise-robust framework to learn from noisy labels for the segmentation task. We first introduce a noise-robust Dice loss that is a generalization of Dice loss for segmentation and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss for robustness against noise, then propose a novel COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesion segmentation network (COPLE-Net) to better deal with the lesions with various scales and appearances. The noise-robust Dice loss and COPLE-Net are combined with an adaptive self-ensembling framework for training, where an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of a student model is used as a teacher model that is adaptively updated by suppressing the contribution of the student to EMA when the student has a large training loss. The student model is also adaptive by learning from the teacher only when the teacher outperforms the student. Experimental results showed that: (1) our noise-robust Dice loss outperforms existing noise-robust loss functions, (2) the proposed COPLE-Net achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art image segmentation networks, and (3) our framework with adaptive self-ensembling significantly outperforms a standard training process and surpasses other noise-robust training approaches in the scenario of learning from noisy labels for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation.","output":"A Noise-Robust Framework for Automatic Segmentation of COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesions From CT Images."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges to human beings, related to not only health and way of life but also teaching because of the interruption of the standard training at universities imposed by lockdowns.

We conclude with a reconsideration of the appropriate role of academic medicine and journals.","output":"The Decline of the Experimental Paradigm During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Template for the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not available.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 invades the West.

Manual muscle testing, load cell coupled with a signal conditioner, and handheld dynamometry are three widely used techniques for measuring isometric muscle strength. Recently, there is a proliferation of low-cost tools that have potential to be used to measure muscle strength. This study examined both the criterion validity, inter-day reliability and intra-day reliability of a microcontroller-based load cell amplifier for quantifying muscle strength. To do so, a low-cost microcontroller-based load cell amplifier for measuring lower and upper limb maximal voluntary isometric muscular force was compared to a commercial grade signal conditioner and to a handheld dynamometer. The results showed that the microcontroller-based load cell amplifier correlated nearly perfectly (Pearson's R-values between 0.947 to 0.992) with the commercial signal conditioner and the handheld dynamometer, and showed good to excellent association when calculating ICC scores, with values of 0.9582 [95% C.I.: 0.9297-0.9752] for inter-day reliability and of 0.9269 [95% C.I.: 0.8909-0.9533] for session one, intra-day reliability. Such results may have implications for how the evaluation of muscle strength measurement is conducted in the future, particularly for offering a commercial-like grade quality, low cost, portable and flexible option.","output":"Assessing the Validity and Reliability of A Low-Cost Microcontroller-Based Load Cell Amplifier for Measuring Lower Limb and Upper Limb Muscular Force"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, new attention has been given to different acoustic bio-markers of the respiratory disorders. Deep Neural Network (DNN) has become very popular with the audio classification task due to its impressive performance for speech detection, audio event classification etc. This paper presents CoughNet-V2 - a scalable multimodal DNN framework to detect symptomatic COVID-19 cough. The framework was designed to be implemented on point-of-care edge devices to help the doctors at pre-screening stage for COVID-19 detection. A crowd-sourced multimodal data resource which contains subjects' cough audio along with other relevant medical information was used to design the CoughNet-V2 framework. CoughNet-V2 shows multimodal integration of cough audio along with medical records improves the classification performance than that of any unimodal frameworks. Proposed CoughNet-V2 achieved an area-under-curve (AUC) of 88.9% for the binary classification task of symptomatic COVID-19 cough detection. Finally, measurement of the deployment attributes of the CoughNet-V2 model onto processing components of an NVIDIA TX2 development board is presented as a proposition to bring the healthcare system to consumers' fingertips.

METHODS: A total of 344 patients treated with IRD (N = 127) or RD (N = 217) were selected for analysis from the Czech Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies (RMG). Descriptive statistics were used to assess patients characteristics associated with the respective therapy. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS), secondary end points included response rates and overall survival (OS). Survival endpoints were plotted using Kaplan-Meier methodology at 95% Greenwood confidence interval. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effect of treatment regimens and the significance of uneven variables. Statistical tests were performed at significance level 0.05. RESULTS: In the whole cohort, median PFS for IRD was 17.5 and for RD was 11.5 months favoring the all-oral triplet, p = 0.005; in patients within relapse 1C3, the median PFS was 23.1 vs 11.6 months, p = 0.001. The hazard ratio for PFS was 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51C0.89, p = 0.006). The PFS advantage translated into improved OS for patients treated with IRD, median 36.6 months vs 26.0 months (p = 0.008). The overall response rate (ORR) was 73.0% in the IRD group vs 66.2% in the RD group with a complete response rate (CR) of 11.1% vs 8.8%, and very good partial response (VGPR) 22.2% vs 13.9%, IRD vs RD respectively. The IRD regimen was most beneficial in patients 75 years with ISS I, II, and in the first and second relapse. Patients with the presence of extramedullary disease did not benefit from IRD treatment (median PFS 6.5 months). Both regimens were well tolerated, and the incidence of total as well as grade 3/4 toxicities was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis confirms the results of the TOURMALINE-MM1 study and shows benefit of all-oral triplet IRD treatment versus RD doublet. It demonstrates that the addition of ixazomib to RD improves key survival endpoints in patients with RRMM in a routine clinical setting.","output":"Survival benefit of ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRD) over lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients in routine clinical practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is associated with changes in memory.

In the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin the viral glycoproteins were equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition GIc(3)Man(8,9)(GIcNAc)(2) and the yield of virus in the extracellular medium was reduced as a result of a block in the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor (pE2) of the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein. The mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) also inhibited the appearance of virus in the medium and the oligosaccharides on the viral glycoproteins had the composition Man(9)(GIcNAc)(2). However, pE2 was cleaved to E2 under these conditions, and it was found that when the yield of virus from the cells and medium together was considered, there was no difference between untreated and dMM-treated cultures, suggesting the presence of intracellular virus particles in the dMM-treated cultures. When examined by electron microscopy, the dMM-treated cultures were found to contain intracellular virus particles. In addition, nucleocapsids were found lining intracellular membranes. These observations taken together with the plaque test data intimate that Sindbis virus preferentially buds from internal membranes in BHK cells treated with dMM.

A key component of COVID-19 control efforts is serological testing to determine the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and quantify individual immune responses to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Here, we describe a laboratory-developed antibody test that uses readily available research-grade reagents to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patient blood samples with high sensitivity and specificity. We further show that this sensitive test affords the estimation of viral spike-specific IgG titers from a single sample measurement, thereby providing a simple and scalable method to measure the strength of an individuals immune response. The accuracy, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness of this test make it an excellent option for clinical deployment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. IMPORTANCE Serological surveillance has become an important public health tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Detection of protective antibodies and seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination can help guide patient care plans and public health policies. Serology tests can detect antibodies against past infections; consequently, they can help overcome the shortcomings of molecular tests, which can detect only active infections. This is important, especially when considering that many COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic. In this study, we describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based qualitative and quantitative serology test developed to measure IgG and IgA antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The test can be deployed using commonly available laboratory reagents and equipment and displays high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IgG titers in patient samples can be estimated from a single measurement, enabling the assays use in high-throughput clinical environments.","output":"Single-Dilution COVID-19 Antibody Test with Qualitative and Quantitative Readouts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zygotes at the 1-cell stage have been genetically modified by microinjecting the CRISPR/Cas9 components for the generation of targeted gene knockout in mammals. In the avian species, genetic modification of the zygote is difficult because its unique reproductive system limits the accessibility of the zygote at the 1-cell stage. To date, only a few CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockouts have been reported using the chicken as a model among avian species, which requires 3 major processes: isolation and culture of primordial germ cells (PGCs), modification of the genome of PGCs in vitro, and injection of the PGCs into the extraembryonic blood vessel at the early embryonic stages when endogenous PGCs migrate through circulation to the genital ridge. In the present study, the adenoviral CRISPR/Cas9 vector was directly injected into the quail blastoderm in newly laid eggs. The resulting chimeras generated offspring with targeted mutations in the melanophilin (MLPH) gene, which is involved in melanosome transportation and feather pigmentation. MLPH homozygous mutant quail exhibited gray plumage, whereas MLPH heterozygous mutants and wild-type quail exhibited dark brown plumage. In addition, the adenoviral vector was not integrated into the genome of knockout quail, and no mutations were detected in potential off-target regions. This method of generating genome-edited poultry is expected to accelerate avian research and has potential applications for developing superior genetic lines for poultry production in the industry.","output":"Direct delivery of adenoviral CRISPR/Cas9 vector into the blastoderm for generation of targeted gene knockout in quail."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapy for cutaneous melanoma, the deadliest of the skin cancers, is inextricably linked to the immune system.

The current treatment strategy relies on the extensive usage of classical inactivated vaccine which is marred by large doses, short immunization cycles and safety concerns. METHODS: The present study aimed at optimization of RDPV VP2 gene, subcloning the gene into plasmid pET30a, and its subsequent transfer to Escherichia coli with trigger factor 16 for co-expression. The protein thus expressed was purified with ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic chromatography, and endotoxin extraction procedures. VLPs were examined by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and the efficacy of VLPs vaccine was tested in vivo. RESULTS: Results indicated that RDPV VP2 protein could be expressed soluble. Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering results indicated that RDPV VP2 self-assembled into VLPs. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers elicited by Al(OH)(3) adjuvanted RDPV VLPs were comparable with RDPV inactivated vaccines, and the viral loads in the blood of the struck raccoon dogs were greatly reduced. Hematoxylin and eosin and Immunohistochemical results indicated that RDPV VLPs vaccine could protect raccoon dogs against RDPV infections.

Plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major phospholipid of circulating lipoproteins, is synthesized in human liver by two biologically diverse pathways: the cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP):choline and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathways. Here, we used ESI-MS/MS both to characterize plasma PC compositions and to quantify metabolic fluxes of both pathways using stable isotopes in patients with severe ARDS and in healthy controls. Direct incorporation of methyl-D(9)-choline estimated CDP:choline pathway flux, while PEMT flux was determined from incorporations of one and two methyl-D(3) groups derived from methyl-D(9)-choline. The results of MS/MS analysis showed significant alterations in plasma PC composition in patients with ARDS versus healthy controls. In particular, the increased overall methyl-D(9)-PC enrichment and, most importantly, the much lower methyl-D(3)-PC and methyl-D(6)-PC enrichments suggest increased flux through the CDP:choline pathway and reduced flux through the PEMT pathway in ARDS.

Reflection on recent advances in the use of diagnostic testing, as well as the application of diagnostic labels, provides an important perspective to understand how far the specialty of allergy and immunology has come in improving the lives of patients and families. Examples of recent paradigm shifts in anaphylaxis-risk management include approaches to peanut allergy prevention without screening, deferral of corticosteroids to prevent biphasic anaphylaxis reactions, reevaluation of reflex use of emergency medical services for resolved community anaphylaxis, and an approach to penicillin allergy delabeling with direct oral challenge. Routine medical practices to decrease anaphylaxis risk can have lifelong impacts for patients-beyond just preventing anaphylaxis.

Because medicine remains a science of uncertainty and an art of probability, a critical approach to risk mitigation remains necessary to find the often-elusive balance in anaphylaxis prevention.","output":"The Revenge of Unintended Consequences of Anaphylaxis-Risk Overdiagnosis: How Far We Have Come and How Far We Have to Go"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have previously characterized AprESJ4, the major fibrinolytic enzyme from Bacillus subtilis SJ4 (Yao et al, 2019). During the study, we observed a 68 kDa protein with fibrinolytic activity. In this study, we cloned the gene (vprSJ4) encoding the 68 kDa protein, a mature Vpr, a minor protease secreted by Bacillus species. vprSJ4 encodes a preproenzyme consisting of 810 amino acids (aa) including signal sequence (28 aa) and prosequence (132 aa). The mature enzyme (650 aa) has a predicted molecular weight of 68,467.35. Unlike Vprs from other B. subtilis strains, VprSJ4 has 4 additional amino acids (DEFA) at the C-terminus. vprSJ4 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. PreproVprSJ4 was localized in inclusion bodies, and subjected to in vitro renaturation and purification by an affinity column. SDS-PAGE and western blot showed that autoprocessing of preproVprSJ4 occurred and 68 kDa and smaller proteins were produced. The optimum pH and temperature of the recombinant VprSJ4 was pH 7.0 and 40C, respectively. Kinetic parameters of recombinant VprSJ4 were measured by using an artificial substrate, N-succinyl-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroanilide. Coexpression of vprSJ4 and aprESJ4 using pHY300PLK increased the fibrinolytic activity further (117%) when compared with aprESJ4 single expression using the same vector in B. subtilis WB600.","output":"Cloning of a Novel vpr Gene Encoding a Minor Fibrinolytic Enzyme from Bacillus subtilis SJ4 and the Properties of Vpr"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canine circovirus (CanineCV) is a canine virus, whose pathogenetic role is still uncertain. Based on recent data suggesting its role as entheropathogen, a case-control study was conducted between 2013 and 2016 to investigate the association of CanineCV with gastroenteritis in dogs, alone or in combination with other viral pathogens, including canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine distemper virus (CDV). A total of 219 dogs suffering from acute gastroenteritis disorders and 67 controls randomly recruited among healthy dogs or patients presenting without enteric signs were screened by a panel of real-time (RT-)PCR assays for CanineCV, CPV, CCoV and CDV. A high prevalence of viral infections was detected in dogs with gastroenteritis (77.16%), with CPV representing the most frequently detected enteropathogen, followed by CanineCV and CCoV. While CPV and CCoV infections displayed a strong association with occurrence of acute gastroenteritis (p < 0.00001), detection of CanineCV in control dogs (28.35%) occurred with prevalence comparable to that of clinical cases (32.42%), so that its correlation with gastrointestinal disease was not statistically supported (p = 0.530988). Different from the clinical cases, where co-infections were frequently observed, all positive samples from the control group contained single infections. Noteworthy, a significant association was calculated between co-infections with CanineCV and occurrence of acute gastroenteritis (p < 0.00001).

Momentum then started to build toward understanding how antibodies could recognize the vast universe of potential antigens and how antibody-combining sites could be tailored to engage antigens with high specificity and affinity through recombination of germline genes (V, D, J) and somatic mutation. Equivalent groundbreaking structures in the cellular immune system appeared some 15 to 20 years later and illustrated how processed protein antigens in the form of peptides are presented by MHC molecules to T cell receptors. Structures of antigen receptors in the innate immune system then explained their inherent specificity for particular microbial antigens including lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, small molecules, and specific proteins. These two sides of the immune system act immediately (innate) to particular microbial antigens or evolve (adaptive) to attain high specificity and affinity to a much wider range of antigens. We also include examples of other key receptors in the immune system (cytokine receptors) that regulate immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, these antigen receptors use a limited set of protein folds to accomplish their various immunological roles. The other main players are the antigens themselves. We focus on surface glycoproteins in enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV-2 that enable entry and egress into host cells and are targets for the antibody response.

The pathogen responsible for COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), invades its host through the interaction of its spike (S) protein with a host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In addition to ACE2, heparan sulfate (HS) on the surface of host cells also plays a significant role as a co-receptor. Our previous studies demonstrated that sulfated glycans, such as heparin and fucoidans, show anti-COVID-19 activities. In the current study, rhamnan sulfate (RS), a polysaccharide with a rhamnose backbone from a green seaweed, Monostroma nitidum, was evaluated for binding to the S-protein from SARS-CoV-2 and inhibition of viral infectivity in vitro. The structural characteristics of RS were investigated by determining its monosaccharide composition and performing two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. RS inhibition of the interaction of heparin, a highly sulfated HS, with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (from wild type and different mutant variants) was studied using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In competitive binding studies, the IC(50) of RS against the S-protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to immobilized heparin was 1.6 ng/mL, which is much lower than the IC(50) for heparin (~750 ng/mL). RS showed stronger inhibition than heparin on the S-protein RBD or pseudoviral particles binding to immobilized heparin.

When caring for patients with tracheostomy, speech-language pathologists have significant exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This tutorial provides guidance on practices for safely performing patient evaluation and procedures, thereby reducing risk of infection. Method Data were collated through review of literature, guidelines, and consensus statements relating to COVID-19 and similar high-consequent infections, with a focus on mitigating risk of transmission to health care workers. Particular emphasis was placed on speech-language pathologists, nurses, and other allied health professionals. A multinational interdisciplinary team then analyzed findings, arriving at recommendations through consensus via electronic communications and video conference. Results Reports of transmission of infection to health care workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic and previous outbreaks substantiate the need for safe practices. Many procedures routinely performed by speech-language pathologists have a significant risk of infection due to aerosol generation. COVID-19 testing can inform level of protective equipment, and meticulous hygiene can stem spread of nosocomial infection. Modifications to standard clinical practice in tracheostomy are often required. Personal protective equipment, including either powered air-purifying respirator or N95 mask, gloves, goggles, and gown, are needed when performing aerosol-generating procedures in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Speech-language pathologists are often called on to assist in the care of patients with tracheostomy and known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Appropriate care of these patients is predicated on maintaining the health and safety of the health care team.

Data were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS Information on 370 patients aged between 1 and 91 years was included. 16.2% (n = 60) of patients reported ?hav?ing experienced an oral health problem for which they requested timely dental treatment. Within this group, the most frequent complaints were pain or tooth hypersensitivity (42.4%, n = 26), insufficient restorations (28.8%, n = 17) and gingival or periodontal problems (23.7%, n = 14). Associations between the type of treatment pending and the report of an oral health problem were considerable for patients awaiting treatment under full anesthesia, surgical procedures and endodontic treatment (p = 0.001; 0.003 and 0.048, respectively). Problems were reported most frequently in these treatment groups, ranging from 27.7% to 100%, compared to 12.6% among patients scheduled for routine check-ups. Overall, 8.6% (n = 32) were experiencing pain, of whom 5 patients experienced constant pain. However, only 1.9% (n = 7) of patients made use of emergency dental services.

New concepts under the term Smart Cities are developed globally to face these challenges. The application of information and communication technology can be used as a driver for new innovative and more efficient processes supporting citizens in smart cities. An example is the optimization of everyday life processes like routine medical examinations of seniors during epidemic outbreaks like COVID-19. In this work we propose a novel standards-based IT system to enable evidence-based decision support for seniors, based on the integration of health and public transport data. The system supports seniors to take a safe path with the public transport in a smart city for their routine medical examinations during epidemic outbreaks like COVID-19. Furthermore, we describe the standardized integration of public transport data in the system as the first implementation step of the project. The requirements for the system were defined by a use case described through a sequence diagram, which was subsequently used to define the proposed system's IT architecture. As a first step of the prototype implementation, the integration of public transport data in the system was done using medical interoperability standards. Conformance tests were performed by applying the HL7 FHIR specification 3.0.1 through the official HL7 FHIR validator. The used standards could successfully be applied in the pilot. Semantic interoperability was supported through definition of code lists. The next steps of the prototype implementation include an update to HL7 FHIR 4.0.1 specification, the integration of the telemonitoring branch and the integration of the data from the Epidemiologic Reporting System based on HL7 FHIR. ? 2020 ACM.","output":"Integration of Health and Public Transport Data to Enable Decision Support for Seniors to Reduce Risk of Infection with Communicable Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent events related to the measures taken to control the spread of the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) reduced human mobility (i.e. anthropause), potentially opening connectivity opportunities for wildlife populations. In the Italian Alps, brown bears have recovered after reintroduction within a complex anthropogenic matrix, but failed to establish a metapopulation due to reduced connectivity and human disturbance (i.e. infrastructure, land use, and human mobility). Previous work from Peters et al. (2015, Biol. Cons. 186, 123-133) predicted the main corridors and suitable hot spots for road network crossing for this population across all major roads and settlement zones, to link most suitable habitats. Bears used the identified hot spots for road network crossing over the years, but major barriers such as main motor roads were not overcome, possibly due to functional anthropogenic disturbance, specifically human mobility. By analyzing 404 bear occurrences reported to local authorities (as bear-related complaints) collected between 2016 and 2020 (March 9(th) - May 18(th)), hence including the COVID-19 related lockdown, we tested the effect of human presence on brown bears' use of space and hot spots for road network crossing. Animals occupied human-dominated spaces and approached hot spots for crossing at a higher rate during the lockdown than in previous years, suggesting that connectivity temporarily increased with reduced human mobility for this population. As a result of their increased use of hot spots, bears expanded their use of suitable areas beyond the population core area. Movement of animals across structural barriers such as roads and human settlements may therefore occur in absence of active disturbance. We also showed the value of predictive models to identify hot spots for animal barrier crossing, the knowledge of which is critical when implementing management solutions to enhance connectivity. Understanding the factors that influence immigration and emigration across metapopulations of large mammals, particularly carnivores that may compete indirectly with humans for space or directly as super-predators, is critical to ensure the long-term viability of conservation efforts for their persistence. We argue that dynamic factors such as human mobility may play a larger role than previously recognized.","output":"Animal movements occurring during COVID-19 lockdown were predicted by connectivity models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of this descriptive article is to share the experience in Ege University, Turkey with favipiravir in the treatment of severe SARS CoV-2 pneumonia.

declared in China at the beginning of 2020. Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the 'universal' increase of the mortality rate with age observed in different countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil both unknowns. We test these results with an analogous antibody rate survey in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, showing a good agreement. We also argue that the official number of deaths over 70 years old might be importantly underestimated in most of the countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by how much. Using this information, we estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar increase of the fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly exponential increase of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions, with numbers that range from 1.82% in Italy, to 0.62% in China or even 0.14% in middle Africa.","output":"A scaling approach to estimate the age-dependent COVID-19 infection fatality ratio from incomplete data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Veneto region of northern Italy, which has about 5 million inhabitants, was the second area of the country, after Lombardy, to face the spread of COVID\\\\19.

However, policy makers and planners are not prioritizing long-term planning strategies for urban green and do not attempt to engage citizens in relevant decision-making and urban planning processes. In this context, a web-based public survey was conducted in the city of Thessaloniki (Greece) during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to identify citizens attitudes, satisfaction levels, actual behaviour and future expectations about urban green spaces (UGS). It also aimed to measure the effect of COVID-19 (mobility) restrictions on UGS visitation. All these issues were explored through a spatial lens, by developing measurable and mappable results suitable for future urban planning decisions. According to these results, citizens tend to report a very low satisfaction level about the current state of UGS (in terms of their adequacy and quality), and they tend to travel a great distance to reach an urban park (about 2 km on average). Moreover, the results indicate that spatial differences are very significant in terms of UGS availability and accessibility. Another important outcome of this study is that, unlike in other cities, the frequency of visiting green spaces in Thessaloniki did not increase during the pandemic. On the contrary, a slight downward trend was observed, maybe due to the combined effect of restriction measures and the lack of proximity/availability of UGS to local population groups.

Most importantly, SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological complications in children, such as shortness of breath, myalgia, stroke, and encephalopathy.

OBJECTIVES To measure changes in patients' utilization of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain and related outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A pre-post study was conducted within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation (PRECISION Pain Research Registry) using data in the 3 months before and 3-6 months after the declaration of a national emergency related to COVID-19. Participants 21-79 years old with chronic low back pain were included in the study and provided self reported data at relevant quarterly encounters. Use of exercise therapy, yoga, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and opioids for low back pain was measured. The primary outcomes were low back pain intensity and back related functioning measured with a numerical rating scale and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respectively. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life scales measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, including scales for physical function, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance, participation in social roles and activities, and pain interference with activities. RESULTS A total of 476 participants were included in this study. The mean age of participants at baseline was 54.0 years (standard deviation, 13.2 years; range, 22-81 years). There were 349 (73.3%) female participants and 127 (26.7%) male participants in the study. Utilization of exercise therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.57), massage therapy (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.83), and spinal manipulation (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93) decreased during the pandemic. A reduction in NSAID use was also observed (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99). Participants reported a significant, but not clinically relevant, improvement in low back pain intensity during the pandemic (mean improvement, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; Cohen's d, 0.11). However, White participants reported a significant improvement in low back pain intensity (mean improvement, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.46), whereas Black participants did not (mean improvement, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.19; p for interaction=0.03). Overall, there was a significant and clinically relevant improvement in pain interference with activities (mean improvement, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.20-2.02; Cohen's d, 0.20). The use of NSAIDs during the pandemic was associated with marginal increases in low back pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS Overall, decreased utilization of treatments for chronic low back pain did not adversely impact pain and functioning outcomes during the first 6 months of the pandemic.

To date, most concentration methods were developed for non-enveloped viruses, and limited studies have directly compared the recovery efficiency of both types of viruses. In this study, the effectiveness of two different concentration methods (Concentrating Pipette Select?

The most effective concentration method varied by microbial analyte. For SARS-CoV-2, the estimated mean recovery efficiencies were statistically significantly greater (p < 0.05) by as much as 5.46 times, using the CP methodthan the AE method amended with MgCl2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA recovery was greater for samples with higher titer seeds regardless of the method, and the estimated mean recovery efficiencies using the CP method were 25.1  11% across ten WWTPs when wastewater samples were seeded with 5  104 gene copies (GC) of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, the AE method significantly (p < 0.05) yielded greater concentrations of indigenous HAdV 40/41 and Lachno3 from wastewater compared to the CP eluate method. Finally, no statistically significant (p > 0.05) differences in indigenous EV concentrations were identified in comparing the AE and CP eluate methods. These data indicate that the most effective concentration method varies by microbial analyte and that the priorities of the surveillance or monitoring program should be considered when choosing the concentration method.","output":"Comparative analysis of rapid concentration methods for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 and quantification of human enteric viruses and a sewage-associated Lachno3 marker gene in untreated wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical research we do to improve our understanding of disease and to develop new therapies has temporarily been delayed as the global health-care enterprise has focused its attention on those impacted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Although rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are decreasing in many areas, many locations continue to have a high prevalence of infection Nonetheless, research must continue and institutions are considering approaches to restarting non-COVID-related clinical investigation Those restarting respiratory research must navigate the added planning challenges that take into account outcome measures that require aerosol-generating procedures Such procedures potentially increase risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to research staff, use limited personal protective equipment, and require conduct in negative-pressure rooms One must also be prepared to address the potential for COVID-19 resurgence With research subject and staff safety and maintenance of clinical trial data integrity as the guiding principles, here we review key considerations and suggest a step-wise approach for resuming respiratory clinical research","output":"Restarting Respiratory Clinical Research in the Era of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic's impact on vascular procedural volumes and outcomes has not been fully characterized. METHODS: Volume and outcome data before (1/2019 - 2/2020), during (3/2020 - 4/2020), and following (5/2020 - 6/2020) the initial pandemic surge were obtained from the Vascular Quality Initiative?. Volume changes were determined using interrupted Poisson time series regression. Adjusted mortality was estimated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The final cohort comprised 57,181 patients from 147 US and Canadian sites. Overall procedure volumes fell 35.2% (95% CI 31.9%, 38.4%, p < 0.001) during and 19.8% (95% CI 16.8%, 22.9%, p < 0.001) following the surge, compared with presurge months. Procedure volumes fell 71.1% for claudication (95% CI 55.6%, 86.4%, p < 0.001) and 15.9% for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) (95% CI 11.9%, 19.8%, p < 0.001) but remained unchanged for acute limb ischemia (ALI) when comparing surge to presurge months. Adjusted mortality was significantly higher among those with claudication (0.5% vs 0.1%; OR 4.38 [95% CI 1.42, 13.5], p = 0.01) and ALI (6.4% vs 4.4%; OR 2.63 [95% CI 1.39, 4.98], p = 0.003) when comparing postsurge with presurge periods.

As such, there is a public health interest in social distancing compliance. The available evidence on distancing practices in public space is limited, however, by the lack of observational data. Here, we apply video observation as a method to examine to what extent members of the public comply with social distancing directives. DATA: Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of interactions in public was collected in inner-city Amsterdam, the Netherlands. From the footage, we observed instances of people violating the 1.5-meter distance directives in the weeks before, during, and after these directives were introduced to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We find that people complied with the 1.5-meter distance directives when these directives were first introduced, but that the level of compliance started to decline soon after. We also find that violation of the 1.5-meter distance directives is strongly associated with the number of people observed on the street and with non-compliance to stay-at-home directives, operationalized with large-scale aggregated location data from cell phones. All three measures correlate to a varying extent with temporal patterns in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, temperature, COVID-19 related Google search queries, and media attention to the topic. CONCLUSION: Compliance with 1.5 meter distance directives is short-lived and coincides with the number of people on the street and with compliance to stay-at-home directives. Potential implications of these findings are that keep- distance directives may work best in combination with stay-at-home directives and place-specific crowd-control strategies, and that the number of people on the street and community-wide mobility as captured with cell phone data offer easily measurable proxies for the extent to which people keep sufficient physical distance from others at specific times and locations.","output":"Social distancing compliance: A video observational analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Diabetes is a lifestyle disease and it has become an epidemic worldwide in recent decades.

Results Overall, the Ag-RDT showed high sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 90.0%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 98.1%, respectively, as well as high or almost perfect agreement (93.3%), reliability assessed by Cohen's  coefficient (0.86), and accuracy assessed by Youdens J index (90%) to detect SARS-CoV-2. The analytical performances of the Ag-RDT remained high in the event of significant viral excretion (i.e., N gene Ct values  33 by reference rtRT-PCR), while the sensitivity of the Ag-RDT dropped to 69.6% with low or very low viral shedding (Ct> 33). Conclusions The SIENNA?

Blood group ABO glycoproteins can influence the binding of the virus to ACE2. The role of ABO blood system in the susceptibility to infection as well as in the clinical outcome of infected patients is still controversial and needs to be clarified. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 167 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who underwent nasopharyngeal swab, and of a control group represented by 891 subjects negative for SARS-CoV-2, to assess the association between ABO and Rh blood system and occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical presentation, and outcome of disease. RESULTS: In the cohort of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, no statistically significant difference in the distribution of ABO blood types compared with controls was observed. Patients with blood type A had a higher risk of developing symptomatic disease (p = 0.002; odds ratio [OR = 3.592]; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.576-8.187) compared to patients with blood types B, AB, and O. Patients with blood types B (p = 0.021; OR = 0.293; 95%CI = 0.099-0.869) and O (p = 0.018; OR = 0.417; 95%CI = 0.199-0.871) showed a lower risk in comparison to the other groups. The clinical progression to mild/moderate and severe/critical disease and the mortality showed no association. Moreover, no relationship with Rh blood type was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a role of ABO blood type in the development of symptomatic disease with a higher risk in subjects with blood type A and a protective effect of blood types B and O.

In the face of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, what direction should the CSR strategy pursue? In the electronics industries in Korea and China, are there any differences in CSR attributes? In this study, we start with some of these basic questions. Considering the promotional and actual costs incurred from CSR activities, CSR strategy are not an issue that can be easily determined from the corporate perspective. However, now it is essential for companies to carry out CSR and sustainable development goals (SDGs) activities, and businesses cannot overlook social issues either. Companies cannot pursue only growth through corporate interests without social value. In this study, we derive three attributes of CSR fit, CSR sustainability, and CSR impact to verify the authenticity of CSR activities. Moreover, we demonstrated the impact of these three attributes on CSR authenticity for the electronics industries in Korea and China. As a result of empirical testing, most of three attributes above mentioned (i.e., CSR fit, CSR sustainability, and CSR impact) produce meaningful results for CSR authenticity. However, CSR sustainability was rejected for the Korea sample, and CSR fit was rejected for the Chinese sample, showing some differences between the two countries. Meanwhile, the digital transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution had strong partial mediating effects between CSR attributes and CSR authenticity. This means that digital transformation can be an important pathway to achieve CSR authenticity and suggests that important mediating effects can eventually lead to a firms competitiveness.","output":"The Effect of CSR Attributes on CSR Authenticity: Focusing on Mediating Effects of Digital Transformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early December 2019, a number of pneumonia cases associated with unknown coronavirus infection were identified in Wuhan, China, and many additional cases were identified in other regions of China and in other countries within 3 months.

The epidemic is spreading to the rest of the world, posing a grave challenge to prevention and control. On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization officially named the novel coronavirus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively. According to the recent research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus mainly infects the respiratory system but may cause damage to other systems. In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"New understanding of the damage of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside the respiratory system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The endotracheal tube (ETT) is an essential interface between the patient and ventilator in mechanically ventilated patients. However, a microbial biofilm is formed gradually on this tube and is associated with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The bacteria present in the biofilm are more resistant to antibiotics, and current medical practices do not make it possible to eliminate. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading pathogens that cause biofilm infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Poly-l-lysine (pLK) is a cationic polypeptide possessing antibacterial properties and mucolytic activity by compacting DNA. Here, we explored the antibiofilm activity of pLK to treat P. aeruginosa biofilms on ETTs while taking into consideration the necessary constraints for clinical translation in our experimental designs. First, we showed that pLK eradicates a P. aeruginosa biofilm formed in vitro on 96-well microplates. We further demonstrated that pLK alters bacterial membrane integrity, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy, and eventually eradicates biofilm formed either by reference or clinical strains of P. aeruginosa biofilms generated in vitro on ETTs. Second, we collected the ETT from patients with P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia. We observed that a single dose of pLK is able to immediately disrupt the biofilm structure and kills more than 90% of bacteria present in the biofilm. Additionally, we did not observe any lung tolerance issue when the pLK solution was instilled into the ETT of ventilated pigs, an animal model particularly relevant to mimic invasive mechanical ventilation in humans. In conclusion, pLK appears as an innovative antibiofilm molecule, which could be applied in the ETT of mechanically ventilated patients.","output":"Treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Present in Endotracheal Tubes by Poly-l-Lysine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than a decade has passed since the triple crises of food, energy and finance in the period 2007-2008.

The aim of this study is not only to address this literature gap but also to explore whether problematic use and well-being differ between Facebook and Instagram users in relation to the number of received likes and Facebook friends/Instagram followers, as well as the importance of these likes and friends/followers. Sixty-nine Facebook users and 66 Instagram users completed an online questionnaire, including self-esteem, loneliness, depression, and problematic Internet use items. Overall, Instagram users exhibited significantly higher problematic use behaviour compared to Facebook users. Age and importance of followers were negatively associated with problematic use of Instagram, whilst only the importance of likes was negatively associated with Facebook. The number of Facebook friends was positively associated with depressive symptoms, but this was not the case for the number of Instagram followers. It is important to note that the number of likes was only negatively associated with self-esteem, but there was no association with loneliness. A potential explanation between the differences in the two platforms and well-being might be related to their different functionalities, for example, Instagram is an image-oriented platform that may boost users self-esteem through post likes but only when the users are strongly connected.","output":"Differences between Facebook and Instagram Usage in Regard to Problematic Use and Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is becoming a leading cause of mortality throughout the world, and few effective therapies are currently available.

The primary outcome was unintended discrepancies (errors) between the physicians' admission medication orders and a comprehensive medication history obtained through interview. We also evaluated the potential seriousness of these discrepancies. All discrepancies were reviewed with the medical team to determine if they were intentional or unintentional. All unintended discrepancies were rated for their potential to cause patient harm. RESULTS After screening 523 admissions, 151 patients were enrolled based on the inclusion criteria. Eighty-one patients (53.6%; 95% confidence interval, 45.7%-61.6%) had at least 1 unintended discrepancy. The most common error (46.4%) was omission of a regularly used medication.

METHODS aSAH patients who underwent clipping surgery within 72 hours from bleeding were included. The patient in the ANH group received 400 mL autologous blood collection, and the blood was returned as needed during surgery. The relationships between ANH and perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, postoperative outcome, complications were analyzed. RESULTS 62 aSAH patients were included between December 2019 and June 2020, 20 in ANH group and 42 in non-ANH group. ANH did not reduce the need of perioperative blood transfusion (3 [15%] vs 5 [11.9%], P = 0.734). However, ANH significantly increased serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (11.5  2.5 g/dL vs 10.3  2.0 g/dL, P = 0.045) and day 3 (12.1  2.0 g/dL vs 10.7  1.3 g/dL, P = 0.002). Multivariable analysis indicated that serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (OR =0.895, 95% CI = 0.822-0.973, P = 0.010) was an independent risk factors for unfavorable outcome, and ROC curve analysis showed that it had a comparable predictive power as WFNS grade (Z =0.275, P > 0.05).

It remains unknown whether circulating vascular markers are sufficient to predict clinical outcomes, are unique to COVID-19, and if vascular permeability can be therapeutically targeted. Methods: Evaluating the prevalence of circulating inflammatory, cardiac and EC activation markers, and the development of a microRNA atlas in 241 patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowed their prognostic value to be assessed by a Random Forest model machine learning approach. Subsequent ex vivo experiments assessed EC permeability responses to patient plasma and were used to uncover modulated gene regulatory networks from which rational therapeutic design was inferred. Findings: Multiple inflammatory and EC activation biomarkers were associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients and in severity-matched SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, while dysregulation of specific microRNAs at presentation was specific for poor COVID-19-related outcomes and revealed disease-relevant pathways. Integrating the datasets using a machine learning approach further enhanced clinical risk prediction for in-hospital mortality. Exposure of ECs to COVID-19 patient plasma resulted in severity-specific gene expression responses and EC barrier dysfunction which was ameliorated using angiopoietin-1 mimetic or recombinant Slit2-N.

SOURCES: A search was conducted in PubMed, Lilacs, and SciELO databases, between the years 2002 and 2013, using the following descriptors: asthma exacerbation, virus, child, and acute respiratory infection. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: A total of 42 original articles addressing the identification of respiratory viruses during episodes of asthma exacerbation were selected, mostly cross\\\\sectional studies. There was a wide variation in the methodology of the assessed studies, particularly in relation to the children's age and methods of collection and viral detection. The results indicate that, in up to 92.2% of exacerbations, a viral agent was potentially the main triggering factor, and human rhinovirus was the most frequently identified factor. The pattern of viral circulation may have been responsible for the seasonality of exacerbations. The association between viral infections and allergic inflammation appears to be crucial for the clinical and functional uncontrolled asthma, but few studies have evaluated other triggering factors in association with viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are present in the majority of asthmatic children during episodes of exacerbation. The involved physiopathological mechanisms are yet to be fully established, and the synergism between allergic inflammation and viral infection appears to determine uncontrolled disease.

From 1983 to 1990, we have necropsied 45 well preserved carcasses out of a total of 120 beluga whales reported dead over this period. Of these 45 animals, nine were affected by 10 malignant neoplasms. Fifteen animals (33%) were affected by pneumonia. Milk production was compromised in eight of 17 mature females (41%), by inflammatory changes (seven animals) and cancer (one animal) which affected the mammary glands. Opportunistic bacteria were found in pure culture, and/or in significant amounts in at least two organs in 20 belugas (44%). The concentrations of both total PCBs and highly chlorinated PCB congeners were much higher in St. Lawrence animals than in Arctic beluga whales.

Results Pregnant participants were significantly less likely to report taking an antidepressant (p<0.01) or anxiolytic medication (p<0.001), to have a prior diagnosis of depression (p<0.01), were more likely to cite COVID-19 as a top stressor (p<0.001) and overall were less likely to practice stress-relieving activities during the first surge. Conclusion Women pregnant following infertility treatment cited the pandemic as their top stressor and were more distressed about the pandemic than their non-pregnant counterparts but were less likely to be engaging in stress-relieving activities. Given the ongoing impact of the pandemic, infertility patients pregnant after treatment should be counseled and encouraged to practice specific stress-reduction strategies.","output":"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Women Pregnant Following Infertility Treatment: A Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, there was a supply shortage of hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate. This problem with medication access and the life changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may predispose patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or lupus erythematosus (LE) to disease flares. Objective: This study aims to investigate self-reported symptoms of disease flares among patients with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus erythematosus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: . A total of 512 completed online surveys from patients with LE or RA were collected. The gathered data included sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported physical symptoms, health service utilization, and availability of hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate. Results: . Seventy-nine percent of respondents had lupus, while 21% had RA. One-third of the cohort had contact with their attending physician during the two-month quarantine period prior to the survey. Eighty-two percent were on hydroxychloroquine and 23.4% were on methotrexate;but 68.6% and 65%, respectively, of those prescribed had irregular intake of these medicines due to unavailability. The current health status was reported as good by 66.2%;24% had no symptoms during the two-week period prior to the survey. The most common symptoms experienced were joint pain (67.4%), muscle pain (46.3%), headache (35.4%), and skin rash (25.4%). Five percent had a combination of these four most common symptoms. There was a higher proportion of patients with irregular supply of hydroxychloroquine with joint pains (54.9% versus 41.7%, p=0.012) and rash (24.7% versus 9.8%, p<0.001, Table 3). Conclusion: In our cohort of RA or LE, the majority reported at least one symptom that may indicate disease flare.

Yet, many US adults expressed reluctance. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare persons willing and unwilling to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and to estimate the effects of vaccination attributes on uptake: proof of vaccination, vaccination setting, effectiveness, duration of immunity, and risk of severe side effects. METHOD: Between 9 and 11 November 2020, 1153 US adults completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) on Phase 2 of the CDC Vaccination Program (August 2021). Each of its eight choice tasks had three vaccination alternatives and \\"no vaccination for 6 months.\\" An opt-out inflated logit model was estimated to test for respondent differences and attribute effects. RESULTS: Respondent demographics were unrelated to one's willingness to be vaccinated (p value 0.533), but those with less education were more likely to be unwilling (p < 0.001). Among those willing, uptake ranged from 61.70 to 97.75%, depending on the vaccination attributes. Effectiveness and safety had the largest effects. Offering proof of vaccination and a choice of setting increased uptake as much as increasing immunity from 3 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize uptake, the CDC Program should standardize proof of vaccination and offer a choice of setting, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. If the first-generation vaccines are efficacious, widely available, and free, overall predicted uptake is 68.81% by the end of Phase 2 (August 2021), which is well below the 75-90% needed for herd immunity.

Participants completed baseline (100%), 1-month follow-up (T2; 73.3%), and 2-month follow-up (T3; 64.4%) surveys. Among intervention participants, 55.8% downloaded and played the game. Of those who played, 46.2% reported a desire to play it again, and 50.8% would recommend it. Game acceptability exceeded hypothesized benchmarks, wherein participants reported high positive affect (M = 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.13, 2.58), low negative affect (M = 2.75; 95% CI: 2.55, 2.95), low tension/annoyance (M = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.98, 3.39), and high competence (M = 2.23; 95% CI: 2.04, 2.43) while playing the game.

Previously, we demonstrated that deletion of either the PL2 core domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 180) or the immediate downstream region (aa 181 to 323) is lethal to the virus. In this study, the PL2 domain was found to encode an active enzyme that mediates efficient processing of nsp2-3 in CHO cells. The PL2 protease possessed both trans- and cis-cleavage activities, which were distinguished by individual point mutations in the protease domain. The minimal size required to maintain these two enzymatic activities included nsp2 aa 47 to 240 (Tyr(47) to Cys(240)) and aa 47 to 323 (Tyr(47) to Leu(323)), respectively. Introduction of targeted amino acid mutations in the protease domain confirmed the importance of the putative Cys(55)- His(124) catalytic motif for nsp2/3 proteolysis in vitro, as were three additional conserved cysteine residues (Cys(111), Cys(142), and Cys(147)). The conserved aspartic acids (e.g., Asp(89)) were essential for the PL2 protease trans-cleavage activity. Reverse genetics revealed that the PL2 trans-cleavage activity played an important role in the PRRSV replication cycle in that mutations that impaired the PL2 protease trans function, but not the cis activity, were detrimental to viral viability. Lastly, the potential nsp2/3 cleavage site was probed.

Oesophageal probes or specific arterial catheters are invasive methods used in this setting. A new noninvasive device based on zero-heat-flux (ZHF) technique (SpotOn) seems promising but has been poorly investigated during rapid core temperature changes (RCTC). OBJECTIVE To assess the accuracy of a SpotOn sensor vs. an oesophageal probe or specific arterial catheter during a slow change in core temperature of less than 1 C within 30 min and RCTC  1 C within 30 min. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Operating rooms at the University Hospital of Poitiers, France. PATIENTS Fifty patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled from June 2015 to March 2016. Data from 49 patients were finally analysed. Among these, 15 patients were treated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. INTERVENTION Each patient had a ZHF sensor placed on the skin surface of the forehead (TempZHF) and an oesophageal probe (TempEso) used as a reference method. Twenty-two patients also had a thermodilution arterial catheter (TempArt) placed in the axillary artery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Core temperature was continuously recorded from the three devices after induction of anaesthesia. Comparison of temperature measurements between methods was made using the Bland and Altman method during two separate periods according to the speed of core temperature changes. RESULTS Compared with TempEso, bias and limits of agreement for TempZHF were 0.1  0.5 C during slow core temperature changes periods and 0.6  1.8 C during RCTC periods (P = 0.0002).

Because mask-wearing is often considered a social contract, it is important to understand the psychosocial factors that influence people's mask-wearing behavior in order to implement the necessary steps to respond to the pandemic. Based on the protection motivation theory (PMT), this study examined the cognitive factors (threat and coping appraisals) that contribute to mask-wearing behavior and the intention to engage in health protective behavior until the end of the pandemic. Furthermore, we examined the roles of social (perceived social norm) and affective (fear) factors in mask-wearing behavior and intention. The sample included 981 voluntary adults in the United States who completed an online survey for this study between 15 October 2020 and 28 November 2020. The results of hierarchical multiple regressions showed that all PMT variables (severity, susceptibility, response efficacy, and self-efficacy) were associated with mask-wearing behavior and intention to engage in health protective behavior until the end of the pandemic. Perceived social norm and fear provided unique, additive contributions to the predictability of mask-wearing behavior and intention. Overall findings suggest the importance of considering cognitive, social, and affective factors altogether in order to better understand an individual' intention and behavior toward mask wearing during the pandemic.","output":"Psychosocial factors associated with mask-wearing behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work examines the impact of the SARS-CoV2 epidemic and the organizational recommendations that have been issued since March 16 on tumor boards (TB) activity.

The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians' attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72,070 files (including 30,127 first submissions). There was a moderate decrease of 8 % in the number of meetings after March 16, 2020. The number of files examined decreased by 23 % in the following month and even more by 33 % in the third period. The physicians' number who attended MTM also decreased by 25 %. The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part of the region. This first study of tumor board activity, covering a large region but little affected by the pandemic, shows that its impact on the participation to the MTM has been moderate. In addition, tumor boards have followed the recommendations for optimizing quorum. However, the decrease in average MTM activity, particularly for first submissions, suggests a potential delay in patient management.

Methods: This was a two-visit prospective, randomized, controlled, same-day crossover study in participants with SS. Inclusion criteria were assessed at a baseline screening visit and included an Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score 13, and a Schirmer with anesthesia 10 mm/5 min (in at least one eye), with a cotton swab stimulation induced increase of 4 mm in the same eye. Participants returned for the application visit, where they received intranasal and extranasal applications of the ITN in random sequence, separated by at least 60 min. Schirmer scores were measured in both eyes after each application and compared to baseline values. Generalized linear models were performed to compare the change in Schirmer scores from baseline, and generalized estimating equations were used to account for correlations from repeated measurements in the same eye and measurements from two eyes of the same patient. Results: Fifty-five participants were screened and 35 were enrolled (all female), ranging in age from 31 to 72 years (mean, 57 years). The baseline OSDI score ranged from 14 to 91 (mean, 50.5), and the baseline Schirmer score had a mean (SD) of 6.4 (3.5) ranging from 0 to 20 (mm/5min). Improvement in Schirmer scores was significantly greater for intranasal device application (13.5 mm/5min, 95% CI: 10.4, 16.5) compared to extranasal device application (0.8mm/5min, 95% CI: -0.9, 2.4) (p<0.0001). The effects of the intranasal device application were significant regardless of the participant's baseline Schirmer score and systemic SS medication usage (p<0.05). Conclusion: Intranasal application of the ITN device significantly increased tear production in a subset of SS patients compared to baseline and was more effective than extranasal application. While production of the ITN device was recently discontinued, our findings suggest that other therapies that neurostimulate the lacrimal function unit may be effective in a subset of SS patients.","output":"Efficacy of an Intranasal Tear Neurostimulator in Sj?gren Syndrome Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The preeminent target of present study is to reveal the speed characteristic of ongoing outbreak COVID\\\\19 due to novel coronavirus.

In mice subjected to ARDS by airway exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, there was marked loss of MCU expression in AT2. The ability of mice to survive ARDS depended on the extent to which the MCU expression recovered, indicating that the viability of Ca2+ buffering by AT2 mitochondria critically determines ARDS severity.

Among all norovirus genotypes, GII.3 is particularly prevalent in the pediatric population. Here we report the identification of two distinct blockade antibody epitopes on the GII.3 capsid. We generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from mice immunized with virus-like particle (VLP) of a GII.3 cluster 3 strain. Two of these mAbs, namely 8C7 and 8D1, specifically bound the parental GII.3 VLP but not VLPs of GII.4, GII.17, or GI.1. In addition, 8C7 and 8D1 efficiently blocked GII.3 VLP binding with its ligand, histo-blood group antigens (HBGA). These data demonstrate that 8C7 and 8D1 are GII.3-specific blockade antibodies. By using a series of chimeric VLPs, we mapped the epitopes of 8C7 and 8D1 to residues 385C400 and 401C420 of the VP1 capsid protein, respectively. These two blockade antibody epitopes are highly conserved among GII.3 cluster 3 strains. Structural modeling shows that the 8C7 epitope partially overlaps with the HBGA binding site (HBS) while the 8D1 epitope is spatially adjacent to HBS.

However, the interplay between this disease, changes in pollution, climate, and aversion to activation of emergency medical services represents a challenging conundrum. We aimed at appraising the impact of COVID-19, weather, and environment features on the occurrence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in a large Italian region and metropolitan area. METHODS AND RESULTS: Italy was hit early on by COVID-19, such that state of emergency was declared on January 31, 2020, and national lockdown implemented on March 9, 2020, mainly because the accrual of cases in Northern Italy. In order to appraise the independent contribution on changes in STEMI and NSTEMI daily rates of COVID-19, climate and pollution, we collected data on these clinical events from tertiary care cardiovascular centers in the Lazio region and Rome metropolitan area. Multilevel Poisson modeling was used to appraise unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates for the daily incidence of STEMI and NSTEMI cases. The sample included 1448 STEMI and 2040 NSTEMI, with a total of 2882 PCI spanning 6 months. Significant reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI were evident already in early February 2020 (all p<0.05), concomitantly with COVID-19 spread and institution of national countermeasures. Changes in STEMI and NSTEMI were inversely associated with daily COVID-19 tests, cases, and/or death (p<0.05). In addition, STEMI and NSTEMI incidences were associated with daily NO2, PM10, and O3 concentrations, as well as temperature (p<0.05). Multi-stage and multiply adjusted models highlighted that reductions in STEMI were significantly associated with COVID-19 data (p<0.001), whereas changes in NSTEMI were significantly associated with both NO2 and COVID-19 data (both p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI in the COVID-19 pandemic may depend on different concomitant epidemiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms. In particular, recent changes in STEMI may depend on COVID-19 scare, leading to excess all-cause mortality, or effective reduced incidence, whereas reductions in NSTEMI may also be due to beneficial reductions in NO2 emissions in the lockdown phase.","output":"Interplay between COVID-19, pollution, and weather features on changes in the incidence of acute coronary syndromes in early 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has become one of the most widely talked about topics on social media.

The expression analysis revealed that both mRNA and protein levels of ACE2 had increased in colon cancer samples than normal group. Next, the prognosis analysis has indicated that the upregulation of ACE2 was not correlated with patient survival outcomes. Further assessment displayed the hypomethylation of the ACE2 gene promoter in COAD patients. This methylation status has a strong negative correlation with ACE2 gene expression.

Finally, we found that ACE2 gene expression had a significant association with the immune cell infiltration levels in COAD patients. In conclusion, it has plausible that COAD patients are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and experience severe injuries. Moreover, COVID-19 would bring unfavorable survival outcomes for patients with colon cancer by way of immune cell infiltration linked process. The present study highlights the importance of preventive actions for COAD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"ACE2 correlates with immune infiltrates in colon adenocarcinoma: Implication for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated pneumonia has emerged in Wuhan, China.

METHODS: In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled ambulatory outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by a molecular method who received hydroxychloroquine. The patients were divided into low- and moderate-risk groups based on the Tisdale risk score for drug-associated QT prolongation, and the QT interval was corrected for heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc). The QTc interval was measured by electrocardiography both pretreatment (QTc1) and 4 h after the administration of hydroxychloroquine (QTc2). The difference between the QTc1 and QTc2 intervals was defined as the QTc. The QTc1 and QTc2 intervals and QTc values were compared between the two risk groups. RESULTS: The median and interquartile range (IQR) age of the patients was 47.0 (36.2C62) years, and there were 78 men and 74 women. The median (IQR) QTc1 interval lengthened from 425.0 (407.2C425.0) to 430.0 (QTc2; 412.0C443.0) milliseconds (ms). However, this was not considered an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QTc interval requiring drug discontinuation, because none of the patients had a QTc of >60 ms or a QTc2 of >500 ms. Moreover, the median (quartiles; minimum-maximum) QTc value was higher in patients in the moderate-risk group than those in the low-risk group (10.0 [?4.0C18.0; ?75.0C51.0] vs. 7.0 [?10.5C23.5; ?53.0C59.0 ms]) (p = 0.996). Clinical improvement was noted in 91.4% of the patients, the exceptions being 13 patients who presented with non-serious adverse drug reactions or who had severe COVID-19 and were hospitalized. Adverse effects related to hydroxychloroquine were non-serious and occurred in 52.8% (n = 80) of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that hydroxychloroquine is safe for COVID-19 and not associated with a risk of ventricular arrhythmia due to drug-induced QTc interval prolongation. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine was well tolerated, and there were no drug-related non-serious adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients who were stable and did not require hospitalization.","output":"Safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in 152 outpatients with confirmed COVID-19: A pilot observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic requires a range of healthcare services to meet the needs of society The objective was to explore what is known about the roles and services performed by frontline pharmacists during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic A scoping review was conducted of frontline pharmacists roles and services during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic A medical librarian conducted comprehensive searches in five bibliographic databasesMEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection for articles published between December 2019 and December 2020 The initial search retrieved 3269 articles After removing duplicates, 1196 articles titles and abstracts were screened, 281 full texts were reviewed for eligibility, and 63 articles were included This scoping review presents a conceptual framework model of the different layers made visible by COVID-19 of pharmacist roles in public health, information, and medication management It is theorized that there is an invisible layer of change representing evolving professional role identity that may influence permanent role change following the pandemic Thus, the pharmacy profession needs to build upon the lessons and experiences of this global pandemic and not let the momentum of the visible and invisible changes go to waste","output":"COVID the Catalyst for Evolving Professional Role Identity?

Cholesterol depletion from the cellular membrane by Methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) is known as one of the processes initiating NET formation. Since neutrophils mainly act in an inflammatory environment with decreased, so-called hypoxic, oxygen conditions, we aimed to study the effect of oxygen and the oxygen stress regulator hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 on cholesterol-dependent NET formation. Thus, murine bone marrow-derived neutrophils from wild-type and HIF-knockout mice or human neutrophils were stimulated with MCD under normoxic (21% O(2)) compared to hypoxic (1% O(2)) conditions, and the formation of NETs were studied by immunofluorescence microscopy. We found significantly induced NET formation after treatment with MCD in murine neutrophils derived from wild-type as well as HIF-1 KO mice at both hypoxic (1% O(2)) as well as normoxic (21% O(2)) conditions. Similar observations were made in freshly isolated human neutrophils after stimulation with MCD or statins, which block the HMG-CoA reductase as the key enzyme in the cholesterol metabolism.

As replication of many viruses - including MERS-CoV - is supported by enhanced aerobic glycolysis, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 replication in host cells (especially airway cells) is reliant upon altered glucose metabolism. This metabolism is similar to the Warburg effect well studied in cancer. Counteracting two main pathways (PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling) sustaining aerobic glycolysis inhibits MERS-CoV replication and thus, very likely that of SARS-CoV-2, which shares many similarities with MERS-CoV. The Warburg effect appears to be involved in several steps of COVID-19 infection. Once induced by hypoxia, the Warburg effect becomes active in lung endothelial cells, particularly in the presence of atherosclerosis, thereby promoting vasoconstriction and micro thrombosis. Aerobic glycolysis also supports activation of pro-inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and M1 macrophages. As the anti-inflammatory response and reparative process is performed by M2 macrophages reliant on oxidative metabolism, we speculated that the switch to oxidative metabolism in M2 macrophages would not occur at the appropriate time due to an uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cascade. Aging, mitochondrial senescence and enzyme dysfunction, AMPK downregulation and p53 inactivation could all play a role in this key biochemical event. Understanding the role of the Warburg effect in COVID-19 can be essential to developing molecules reducing infectivity, arresting endothelial cells activation and the pro-inflammatory cascade.","output":"The key role of Warburg effect in SARS-CoV-2 replication and associated inflammatory response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Virus epidemics may be mitigated if people comply with directives to stay at home and keep their distance from strangers in public. As such, there is a public health interest in social distancing compliance. The available evidence on distancing practices in public space is limited, however, by the lack of observational data. Here, we apply video observation as a method to examine to what extent members of the public comply with social distancing directives. DATA: Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of interactions in public was collected in inner-city Amsterdam, the Netherlands. From the footage, we observed instances of people violating the 1.5-meter distance directives in the weeks before, during, and after these directives were introduced to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We find that people complied with the 1.5-meter distance directives when these directives were first introduced, but that the level of compliance started to decline soon after. We also find that violation of the 1.5-meter distance directives is strongly associated with the number of people observed on the street and with non-compliance to stay-at-home directives, operationalized with large-scale aggregated location data from cell phones. All three measures correlate to a varying extent with temporal patterns in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, temperature, COVID-19 related Google search queries, and media attention to the topic. CONCLUSION: Compliance with 1.5 meter distance directives is short-lived and coincides with the number of people on the street and with compliance to stay-at-home directives. Potential implications of these findings are that keep- distance directives may work best in combination with stay-at-home directives and place-specific crowd-control strategies, and that the number of people on the street and community-wide mobility as captured with cell phone data offer easily measurable proxies for the extent to which people keep sufficient physical distance from others at specific times and locations.","output":"Social distancing compliance: A video observational analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of any proper clinical solution, human civilization is only left with sophisticated intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.

This exploratory study examines experiences of work-related psychosocial stressors, psychological distress, and mental health diagnoses among mental health researchers. METHODS: This international cross-sectional study involved 207 mental health researchers who were post-graduate students or employed in research institutes or university settings. Work-related psychosocial stressors were measured by the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire III (COPSOQ III). Psychological distress was assessed using the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Thoughts of suicide was assessed using an adaptation of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). History of mental health diagnoses was assessed through a custom questionnaire. Pearsons chi-square test of independence was used to compare mental health diagnoses and suicidal ideation across career stages. The association between work-related psychosocial stressors and psychological distress was conducted using multivariate linear regression controlling for key demographic, employment-related and mental health factors. RESULTS: Differences in demands at work and the work-life balance domain were lowest among support staff (p = 0.01). Overall, 13.4% of respondents met the threshold for severe psychological distress, which was significantly higher in students compared to participants from other career stages (p = 0.01). Among the subgroup of participants who responded to the question on mental health diagnoses and suicidal ideation (n = 152), 54% reported a life-time mental health diagnosis and 23.7% reported suicidal ideation since their academic career commencement. After controlling for key covariates, the association between the interpersonal relations and leadership domain and psychological distress was attenuated by the mental health covariates included in model 3 ( = ?0.23, p = 0.07). The association between the remaining work-related psychosocial stressors and psychological distress remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Despite working in the same environment, research support staff report experiencing significantly less psychosocial stressors compared to postgraduate students, early-middle career researchers and senior researchers.

When infected, children generally remain asymptomatic or develop mild disease. A small number of pediatric cases required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory support with a mechanical ventilation and additional life-saving interventions. Even if rarely, death can occur. Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the risk factors associated with severe outcome among pediatric patients with COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: Early identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected children at risk of developing severe COVID-19 is vital for service planning, as severely affected pediatric patients require high-quality care and should be followed only where an adequately structured PICU is available. However, early identification of children who must be carefully monitored for substantial risk of severe COVID-19 remains difficult. An underlying comorbidity and heart involvement are frequently observed in severe paediatric cases. Reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction < 60%; diastolic dysfunction; and arrhythmias, including ST segment changes, QTc prolongation, and premature atrial or ventricular beat, are the earliest manifestations of heart involvement. Inclusion of heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function among predictive markers could lead to a more effective evaluation of children at risk with proper selection of those to admit to the PICU and with more adequate treatment in case of more severe clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: To appropriately manage severe pediatric COVID-19 cases, greater attention should be paid to risk factors in children and adolescents, especially to cardiovascular alterations (e.g., heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function).

ENS is a network of neurons and glia found in the gut wall which controls gastrointestinal function independently from the central nervous system. Moreover, two types of epithelial cells are crucial in the creation of an interface between the lumen and the ENS: they are the tuft cells and the enteroendocrine cells (EECs). In addition, the abundant enteric glial cells (EGCs) in the intestinal mucosa play a key role in controlling the intestinal epithelial barrier. Our aim was to localize and characterize the presence of -syn in the normal human jejunal wall. Surgical specimens of proximal jejunum were collected from patients submitted to pancreaticoduodenectomy and intestinal sections underwent immunohistochemical procedure. Alpha-syn has been found both at the level of the ENS and the epithelial cells. To characterize -syn immunoreactive epithelial cells, we used markers such as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), useful for the identification of tuft cells. Then we evaluated the co-presence of -syn with serotonin (5-HT), expressed in EECs. Finally, we used the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75NTR), to detect peripheral EGCs. The presence of -syn has been demonstrated in EECs, but not in the tuft cells. Additionally, p75NTR has been highlighted in EECs of the mucosal layer and co-localized with -syn in EECs but not with ChAT-positive cells. These findings suggest that -syn could play a possible role in synaptic transmission of the ENS and may contribute to maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier of the small intestine through EECs.","output":"Distribution of -synuclein in normal human jejunum and its relations with the chemosensory and neuroendocrine system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To retrospectively analyze the thin-section computed tomographic (CT) features in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the authors' institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS From March 11, 2003, to April 2, 2003, 74 patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of SARS underwent CT of the thorax; all underwent thin-section CT except for one patient who underwent conventional CT. Group 1 (n = 23) patients had symptoms of SARS in keeping with criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a positive chest radiograph. Group 2 (n = 17) patients had a high clinical suspicion of SARS but a normal radiograph. Group 3 (n = 34) patients had minor symptoms and a normal chest radiograph. The thin-section CT images were analyzed for ground-glass opacification or consolidation, lesion size in each lung segment, peripheral or central location, interstitial thickening, and other abnormalities. RESULTS Thin-section CT scans were abnormal only for patients in groups 1 and 2. The patient with only conventional CT scans was in group 3; scans for group 3 patients were normal. Affected segments were predominantly in the lower lobes (91 of 149 affected segments). Common findings included ground-glass opacification, sometimes with consolidation, and interlobular septal and intralobular interstitial thickening. The size of each lesion and the total number of segments involved were smaller in group 2 patients. A majority of patients in group 1 (14 of 23) had mixed central and peripheral lesions. In group 2, however, peripheral lesions were more common (10 of 17). In both groups, a purely central lesion was uncommon (one of 23 in group 1 and two of 17 in group 2). CONCLUSION Common thin-section CT features of SARS are ground-glass opacification and lower lobe and peripheral distribution.","output":"Thin-section CT of severe acute respiratory syndrome: evaluation of 73 patients exposed to or with the disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionClozapine is an effective antipsychotic used in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. One of the serious complications of clozapine therapy is agranulocytosis, therefore regular monitoring of the level of white blood cells (WBC) in plasma is necessary. During acute inflammatory infections, including the COVID-19 infection, levels of clozapine may increase, by the CYP 450 system, leading to adverse effects such as sedation, hypersalivation and consequently to aspiration pneumonia.ObjectivesThe aim of the study is to assess the validity of continuing clozapine treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsBrief literature review, based on research of scientific articles published in PubMed, using as keywords the terms clozapine and COVID-19.ResultsResearch studies indicate that SARS-COV2 infection in patients treated with clozapine does not significantly reduce the level of neutrophils, despite commonly observed leucopenia with lymphopenia. Due to pandemic, existing WBC scheme has been modified with a trend towards less frequent measurements. To minimize the side effects of clozapine during infection, it is recommended to reduce the dose of clozapine by half and continue lower dose until 3 days after fever has subsided. Additionally, there have been reports of psychosis recurrence after discontinuation of clozapine causing difficulties in treatment COVID-19 as also comorbid mental disease.ConclusionsTreatment of clozapine is associated with higher risk of COVID-19 complications and at the same time COVID-19 infection may increase clozapine toxicity. Therefore, the risks of COVID-19 infection present a challenge for safe clozapine use. Further research will be needed to assess these dependencies and strategies.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","output":"Clozapine treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children continue to be poorly prepared and informed about clinical procedures, despite increased evidence of the worth of preparation and the availability of information resources.

The findings indicate that many children (70%, n = 28) and their parents (65%, n = 26) have low procedural knowledge levels. The majority of children (85%, n = 36) reported not receiving or seeking information about their procedure, despite identifying a desire and preference for more information. This study shows a mismatch between the current provision of procedural information and children and parents expectations that information will be provided directly to them by health professionals.

We conducted a study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness and potential cost savings resulting from the implementation of a protocol guiding the transition to CPAP in OSA patients previously treated with APAP. METHODS: This prospective study included patients with OSA under APAP who were followed up at the Sleep Medicine outpatient clinic of a tertiary referral hospital between January 2019 and January 2021. Treatment was switched to CPAP in patients who met the following criteria: satisfactory adaptation and adherence to APAP, residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of < 5/hour, and no relevant air leaks. APAP and CPAP outcomes were compared and an estimate of the savings obtained by the transition from APAP to CPAP was calculated. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were included in the study. APAP and CPAP were both effective in correcting obstructive events and improving daytime sleepiness. No significant differences were found regarding treatment adherence and tolerance between both PAP modalities. The selection of fixed-pressure CPAP through 90(th) or 95(th) percentile APAP pressure proved to be effective and an alternative strategy to titration polysomnography.

Firstly, I explore strangeness as an intra-subjective and intersubjective condition. The intra-subjective mode conceives of strangeness in relation to an internal other, while the intersubjective usually highlights interactions with strangers who are othered because of their ethnic, racial, sexual, gender and religious identity. Secondly, I consider the recent universalization thesis that speaks to a general existential/ontological condition of otherness. Finally, I investigate the scholarship on the stranger that contends that the experience of strangeness brings with it greater insights.

Some of these relevant biological mechanisms include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, protein and hormone synthesis, energy generation, and regulation of gene transcription. Moreover, relative vitamin deficiencies in plasma are common during sepsis and vitamin therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in some adult and pediatric studies. High-dose intravenous vitamin C has been the vitamin therapy most extensively studied in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock. This includes three randomized control trials (RCTs) as monotherapy with a total of 219 patients showing significant reduction in organ dysfunction and lower mortality when compared to placebo, and five RCTs as a combination therapy with thiamine and hydrocortisone with a total of 1134 patients showing no difference in clinical outcomes. Likewise, the evidence for the role of other vitamins in sepsis remains mixed. In this narrative review, we present the preclinical, clinical, and safety evidence of the most studied vitamins in sepsis, including vitamin C, thiamine (i.e., vitamin B(1)), and vitamin D. We also present the relevant evidence of the other vitamins that have been studied in sepsis and critical illness in both children and adults, including vitamins A, B(2), B(6), B(12), and E.

We sought to define the etiology, clinical presentation, time course and outcomes of children presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with cutaneous manifestations shortly after the first pandemic peak of COVID-19 in Spain. METHODS: Prospective, observational study in children <15 years of age evaluated for skin lesions in the ED of three pediatric hospitals. Children underwent a comprehensive work-up including SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and PCR, and serology and PCR tests for other viruses and bacteria. A one-month follow-up visit was conducted. RESULTS: From April 14 through May 8, 2020 we enrolled 62 children. Of those 34 had acro-ischemic skin lesions and 28 a variety of skin rashes. Overall 40% of children had mild systemic symptoms. Children with chilblains were older, had pain more frequently and more prolonged duration of skin lesions, while those with non-specific rashes had fever more frequently. Lesions were resolved in 75% of children at follow-up. Five patients demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and none tested positive by PCR. Three additional patients tested positive by PCR for rhinovirus, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The number of ED visits for chilblains, which are rare in pediatrics, was high soon after the first peak of COVID-19 in Spain.

In free fatty acids-induced hepatocytes, POL and Myr significantly down-regulated the expression of PTGS2, decreased the number of lipid droplets, and regulated the mRNA expression of lipid synthesis and homeostasis genes, including FASN, CPT1a, SERBP1c, ACC1, and SCD1. In lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophages, POL and Myr significantly reduced the expression of PTGS2 and blocked the secretion of inflammatory mediators TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1.

Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) were used to model effects of lifestyle and PRS on risk of CVD and all-cause mortality, stroke and MI. New CVD (n = 364) and all-cause (n = 2408) deaths, and stroke (n = 748) and MI (n = 1140) events were observed during a 7.8 year mean follow-up. An unfavourable lifestyle (0C1 healthy behaviours) was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.73, 2.45), CVD mortality (HR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.64, 3.76), MI (HR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.65, 2.72) and stroke (HR:1.74; 95% CI: 1.25, 2.43) compared to a favourable lifestyle (4 healthy behaviours). PRS was associated with MI (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.27, 1.43). There was evidence of a lifestyle-genetics interaction for stroke (p = 0.017). Unfavourable lifestyle behaviours predicted higher risk of all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, MI and stroke, independent of genetic risk.","output":"Unhealthy Lifestyle, Genetics and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality in 76,958 Individuals from the UK Biobank Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nocardia asteroides is the main causative agent responsible for nocardiosis disease in immunocompromised patient viz.

We explored the acceptance of HIV self-testing (HIVST) service among PrEP recipients. Methods: : MSM were recruited for the PrEP demonstration in four major cities in China from December 2018 to September 2019, provided with regimens of both daily and on-demand PrEP. Facility-based HIV testing was provided quarterly at clinic visits. Previous HIV testing history and acceptance of free HIVST kits to use between each quarterly clinic visit was collected. Correlates of levels of acceptance were analysed using multivariable ordinal logistic regression. Results: : We recruited 1,222 MSM. among which 48.5% preferred daily PrEP and 51.5% preferred on-demand PrEP. There was 26.8% (321/1222) had never been to any facility-based HIV testing previously, and the self-reported major reason was that they had already routinely used HIVST. A quarter of the participants (74.5%, 910/1222) had used HIVST previously. There were 1184 MSM (96.9%) accepted to use HIVST between each quarterly clinic visits during PrEP usage, composing 947 ( 77.5%) very willing to, 23719.4%willing to, 29 (2.4%) unwilling to, and 9 (0.7%) very unwilling to. Participants preferred daily PrEP (vs. on-demand PrEP, aOR=1.8, 95% CI:1.3-2.4) and had less than 2 times of facility-based HIV testing in the past year (vs. 32, aOR=1.4,95% CI:1.1-1.9) were more likely to have higher level of acceptance of HIVST. Conclusions: : MSM had high acceptance of HIVST, especially among those preferred daily PrEP and with less facility-based HIV testing in the previous year. Offering HIVST services PrEP recipients is feasible and necessary. Above result is of great significance for promoting HIVST among PrEP users during COVID-19, improving awareness of their HIV infection status and ensuring compliance with medication.

Some of these people had never engaged in such behaviors prior to the lockdown. Linear regression showed that higher values of a composite (lockdown) index of self-medication-related behaviors occurring during lockdown were predicted by greater religiosity and the presence of children in a household. Also, independent samples t-tests showed that people who were afraid for their financial future and people who feared for their health obtained higher lockdown index scores than people not having such worries.

Behavioral dimensions of executive function appear to be linked to situational anxiety experience. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between self-related skills of executive functions before the outbreak of COVID-19 and the level of physical and mental anxiety in children during this pandemic. Also, the secondary goal of this study is to predict the level of anxiety based on self-related skills of executive functions. Methods: Information were obtained from Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS), which was collected from 300 healthy children over two months before the COVID-19 outbreak. The children anxiety was measured based on parents reposes to an online anxiety scale when the disease outbreak. Results: The results showed that the total score of self-related skills of executive functions was negatively and significantly related to the anxiety level (r =- .53). In general, the results also demonstrated that self-related skills of executive functions can predict 28% of anxiety. The subscales of self-management (p<0.015, t= 5.56), self-regulation (p<0.011, t= 6.37), self-restraint (p<0.035, t = 4.29) and emotional self-organization (p <0.042, p=0.222) predicted coronavirus anxiety, except self-motivation (p<0.05, p = 0.894).

We aimed to evaluate the evidence and contemporary use of the mucolytic medication dornase alfa for non-cystic fibrosis conditions in the PICU. METHODS: (1) We performed a systematic review with searches in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Study selection: for quality assessment and data synthesis, we included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared dornase alfa to standard care or placebo in critically-ill paediatric patients (<18 years of age) in the PICU. However, non-randomised controlled studies and case series are also discussed. Data extraction: data were extracted independently by multiple reviewers using data extraction forms. The primary outcome was duration of mechanical ventilation. Data synthesis: The GRADE approach was used for quality assessment. No meta-analysis could be performed. (2) A national cross-sectional survey among all seven PICUs in the Netherlands was also performed. RESULTS: The systematic review yielded only one RCT, comparing dornase alfa with normal saline in children after cardiac surgery. In this study, dornase alfa led to a reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation by approximately 1 day (36% reduction). In addition, we found nine retrospective observational and case studies. The survey revealed high current use of dornase alfa in Dutch PICUs: 42% of the respondents reported prescribing dornase alfa at least once every week.

METHODS: Drawing from collective experience within pragmatic pain clinical trials networks, and synthesizing relevant literature, our multidisciplinary working group examined challenges related to integrating justice and equity into pragmatic pain management research conducted in large, integrated health systems. Our analysis draws from military and veteran health system contexts but offers strategies to consider throughout the lifecycle of pragmatic research more widely. RESULTS: We found that PCTs present a unique opportunity to address major influences on health inequities by occupying a space between research, healthcare delivery, and the complexities of everyday life. We highlight key challenges that require attention to support complementary advancement of justice and equity via pragmatic research, offering several strategies that can be pursued. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts are needed to engage diverse stakeholders broadly and creatively in PCTs, such as through dedicated health equity working groups and other collaborative relationships with stakeholders, to support robust and inclusive approaches to research design and implementation across study settings.

Here, an infectious cDNA clone of IBV was used to address the importance of the S protein trafficking signals to virus infection. We constructed infectious cDNA clones lacking the ER retrieval signal, the endocytosis signal, or both. The virus lacking the ER retrieval signal was viable. However, this virus had a growth defect at late times postinfection and produced larger plaques than IBV. Further analysis confirmed that the mutant S protein trafficked though the secretory pathway faster than wild-type S protein. A more dramatic phenotype was obtained when the endocytosis signal was mutated. Recombinant viruses lacking the endocytosis signal (in combination with a mutated dilysine signal or alone) could not be recovered, even though transient syncytia were formed in transfected cells.

Each year these viruses are responsible for recurrent epidemics, frequently in association with genetic variation. There is a requirement for sensitive and rapid diagnostic techniques in order to improve both the diagnosis of infections and the quality of surveillance systems. A new three-dimensional biochip platform (Flow-Thru Chip; MetriGenix) was used to develop a rapid and reliable molecular method for the typing and subtyping of influenza viruses. Oligonucleotide probes immobilized in microchannels of a silicon wafer were selected to recognize multiple fragments of the influenza A virus matrix protein gene; the influenza B virus NS gene; the H1, H3, and H5 hemagglutinin genes; and the N1 and N2 neuraminidase genes. Biotinylated amplicons resulting from either multiplex or random reverse transcription-PCR were hybridized to arrayed oligonucleotides on the influenza virus chip before they were stained with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and were imaged by use of a chemiluminescent substrate. The chip analysis procedure, from the time of pipetting of the sample into the chip cartridge to the time of analysis of the results, was performed in less than 5 h.

METHODS: Between 19 July and 14 August 2020, 4487 households were selected using a random sample stratified by region and citizenship of the head of household (UAE citizen or non-citizen). A cluster sample of 40 labour camps was selected. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were collected. Each participant was first tested by Roche Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, followed, when reactive, by the LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay. RESULTS: Among 8831 individuals from households, seroprevalence was 104% [95% confidence intervals (CIs) 95-114], with higher seroprevalence in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain regions compared with those in Al Dhafra. In households, we found no sex difference and UAE citizens had lower seroprevalence compared with those of other nationalities.

In period 1, forced arterial suction thrombectomy with a Penumbra reperfusion catheter was performed, even in difficult cases; in period 2, forced arterial suction thrombectomy was initially performed, with switching to Solitaire in difficult cases. METHODS We analyzed 135 consecutive patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy with acute large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, 61 from period 1 and 74 from period 2. We defined difficult case for both periods as 3 failed attempts at recanalization. RESULTS Period 2 showed a trend for better angiographic outcome of Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3 (73.8%, period 1 versus 85.1%, period 2; P=0.10). In interperiod subgroup analysis of difficult cases, switching significantly outperformed nonswitching in Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3 recanalization (52.7% versus 82.9%; P=0.030). Differences in puncture-to-recanalization time, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage incidence, and procedure-related complications were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS A switching strategy using 2 mechanical thrombectomy techniques (forced arterial suction thrombectomy to Solitaire) may harbor better angiographic outcomes than a 1 technique only strategy (forced arterial suction thrombectomy).","output":"Switching strategy for mechanical thrombectomy of acute large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently overwhelmed by fighting a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) Within just a few months, the virus has spread all over the country causing many deaths Although some guidelines have been proposed to prevent more casualties, the transmission rate remains high One clinical spectrum that was initially being an underdog for its ability to widely spread COVID-19 is asymptomatic cases Subtle clinical manifestations with the same transmission potential as in symptomatic cases make asymptomatic cases worth to be considered Transmission of asymptomatic cases, commonly in family clusters, will also be a new problem considering some family members have a high risk of COVID-19 The asymptomatic cases remain a problem in developed and former countries infected with COVID-19, and also for Indonesia as a developing country with various uniqueness Indonesia's authorities are struggling to win this battle with COVID-19 with all the available resources, and until now the stressing is still on symptomatic cases while asymptomatic cases can be a silent thread if not recognized and handled properly A better and deeper understanding of various aspects of asymptomatic cases may be a consideration for better health policies ? 2020 EManuscript Technologies All rights reserved","output":"The hidden vulnerability of COVID-19 observed from asymptomatic cases in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing more than a million deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and represent the main target for antibody responses. Humoral responses were shown to be important for preventing and controlling infection by coronaviruses. A promising approach to reduce the severity of COVID-19 is the transfusion of convalescent plasma. However, longitudinal studies revealed that the level of antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines rapidly after the resolution of the infection. Study Design and Methods To extend this observation beyond the RBD domain, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the persistence of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the plasma from 15 convalescent donors. We generated a 293T cell line constitutively expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and used it to develop a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific antibodies in the plasma of convalescent donors. Results and Conclusion We found that the level of antibodies targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike declines gradually after the resolution of the infection. This decline was not related to the number of donations, but strongly correlated with the decline of RBD-specific antibodies and the number of days post-symptom onset. These findings help to better understand the decline of humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and provide important information on when to collect plasma after recovery from active infection for convalescent plasma transfusion.","output":"High-throughput detection of antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in longitudinal convalescent plasma samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bryophytes produce rare and bioactive compounds with a broad range of therapeutic potential, and many species are reported in ethnomedicinal uses. However, only a few studies have investigated their potential as natural anti-inflammatory drug candidate compounds. The present study investigates the anti-inflammatory effects of thirty-two species of bryophytes, including mosses and liverworts, on Raw 264.7 murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or recombinant human peroxiredoxin (hPrx1). The 70% ethanol extracts of bryophytes were screened for their potential to reduce the production of nitric oxide (NO), an important pro-inflammatory mediator. Among the analyzed extracts, two moss species significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO production without cytotoxic effects. The bioactive extracts of Dicranum majus and Thuidium delicatulum inhibited NO production in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 1.04 and 1.54 g/mL, respectively. The crude 70% ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts were then partitioned with different solvents in increasing order of polarity (n-hexane, diethyl ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol). The fractions were screened for their inhibitory effects on NO production stimulated with LPS at 1 ng/mL or 10 ng/mL. The NO production levels were significantly affected by the fractions of decreasing polarity such as n-hexane and diethyl ether ones. Therefore, the potential of these extracts to inhibit the LPS-induced NO pathway suggests their effective properties in attenuating inflammation and could represent a perspective for the development of innovative therapeutic agents.","output":"Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Bryophytes Extracts in LPS-Stimulated RAW264.7 Murine Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Racist and discriminatory federal, state, and local housing policies significantly contribute to disparities in cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality for individuals that self-identify as Black or African American. Here we highlight three key housing policies C redlining, zoning, and the construction of highways C which have wrought a powerful, sustained, and destructive impact on cardiovascular health in Black/African American communities. Redlining and highway construction policies have restricted access to quality health care, increased exposure to carcinogens such as PM(2.5), and increased exposure to extreme heat. At the root of these policy decisions are longstanding, toxic societal factors including racism, segregation, and discrimination, which also serve to perpetuate racial inequities in cardiovascular health. Here, we review these societal and structural factors and then link them with biological processes such as telomere shortening, allostatic load, oxidative stress, and tissue inflammation. Lastly, we focus on the impact of inflammation on the immune system and the molecular mechanisms by which the inflamed immune microenvironment promotes the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. We propose that racial residential segregation and discrimination increases tissue inflammation and cytokine production, resulting in dysregulated immune signaling, which promotes plaque formation and cardiovascular disease. This framework has the power to link structural racism not only to cardiovascular disease, but also to cancer.","output":"Impact of Federal, State, and Local Housing Policies on Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease in Black/African American Men and Women: From Policy to Pathways to Biology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study investigated the contributions of dissocial traits and experience with the police to police perception.

It examines the behavior of a subindex reflecting bank shares' prices against the main WIG index WIG and 14 sector subindices. The authors identify groups of banks with different investors' responses. They also classify banks into separate groups on the basis of changes in the fundamental indicators describing their economic and financial performance. The study concentrates mainly on the verification of the stability of this attribution, explaining reasons for its modifications over time. Purpose of the article: To identify the characteristics of bank clusters determining different capital market responses to their listed shares and to explain the reasons for volatility in investors' behavior within the analyzed period. Methods: The methodology of the research can be described in three areas. The first is the statistical analysis with the emphasis on the use of a quarter range to capture changes in the volatility of share prices. the second area is the clustering k-means method based on the interpolated from quarterly to daily - measures of the hank's financial condition. This mathematical approach is a novelty in finance and economics. The last, third, area is forecasting with the use of linear regression analysis, which is the key factor in determining the abnormal rate f return. The indicated areas are combined through a generally understood correlation analysis. Findings & value added: Large retail banks have been less affected compared to medium-sized ones with relatively rich corporate portfolios. The initial market reaction reflected concern about the resistance to the crisis of poorly capitalized banks with mean liquidity buffers. Upon the announcement of government support, investors' approach to the shares of banks of differentiated economic and financial performance conformed accordingly. These findings are valuable in the long term especially from the perspective of supervision authorities' policy during external shocks. The presented study suggests designing flexible and tailor-made regulatory approach aligned with the defined bank clusters. Its value added also consists in proposing a new method of analysis, combining interpolation and automatic clustering, which has proved to be adequate for the study of a bank's financial condition based on daily frequency data. Furthermore. assuming the same length of the estimation window, a close relationship is shown between the results of clustering and the forecasts based on different measures of rates of return.","output":"The banking sector as the absorber of the COVID-19 crisis' economic consequences: perception of WSE investors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China recently.

There are more than 5.6 million Venezuelan migrants globally and almost 80% reside throughout Latin America. Given the growing number of Venezuelan migrants and COVID-19 vulnerability, this rapid scoping review examined how Venezuelan migrants are considered in Latin American COVID-19 vaccination strategies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a three-phased rapid scoping review of documents published until June 18, 2021: Peer-reviewed literature search yielded 142 results and 13 articles included in analysis; Gray literature screen resulted in 68 publications for full-text review and 37 were included; and official Ministry of Health policies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru were reviewed. Guided by Latin American Social Medicine (LASM) approach, our analysis situates national COVID-19 vaccination policies within broader understandings of health and disease as affected by social and political conditions. RESULTS: Results revealed a heterogeneous and shifting policy landscape amid the COVID-19 pandemic which strongly juxtaposed calls to action evidenced in literature. Factors limiting COVID-19 vaccine access included: tensions around terminologies; ambiguous national and regional vaccine policies; and pervasive stigmatization of migrants. CONCLUSIONS: Findings presented underscore the extreme complexity and associated variability of providing access to COVID-19 vaccines for Venezuelan migrants across Latin America. By querying the timely question of how migrants and specifically Venezuelan migrants access vaccinations findings contribute to efforts to both more equitably respond to COVID-19 and prepare for future pandemics in the context of displaced populations.

RESULTS: The gynecologists expect telemedicine to be used in gynecology and obstetrics. 76.4% (365/478) of the respondents rated their knowledge of telemedicine as insufficient. The majority of respondents (437/478, 91.6%) said they did not currently use telemedicine, although 67.3% (321/478) would like to do so. Obstacles to the introduction of telemedicine include the purchase of technical equipment (325/478, 68.1%), administration (305/478, 64.0%) and poor reimbursement (233/478, 48.9%). Gynecologists surveyed would prefer telemedicine to communicate directly with other doctors (388/478, 81.2%) rather than to communicate with patients (228/478, 47.8%). In the treatment phases, 73.2% (349/478) of the respondents would use telemedicine during follow-up. Half of the respondents would choose tele counseling as a specific approach to improving care (246/478, 51.5%). CONCLUSION: Telemedicine in gynecology finds little use but high acceptance. The absence of a structured framework is an obstacle to effective implementation. Training courses should be introduced to improve the limited knowledge in the use of telemedicine. More research in tele-gynecology is needed. These include large-scale randomized controlled trials, economic analyses and the exploration of user preferences.","output":"Digitization in gynecology and obstetrics in times of COVID-19: Results of a national survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Laparoscopic myomectomy is the uterus-preserving surgical approach of choice in case of symptomatic fibroids. However, it can be a difficult procedure even for an experienced surgeon and can result in excessive blood loss, prolonged operating time and postoperative complications. A combined approach with laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion and simultaneous myomectomy was proposed to reduce these complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combined laparoscopic approach in women with symptomatic \\"large\\" intramural uterine fibroids, compared to the traditional laparoscopic myomectomy alone. METHODS Prospective nonrandomized case-controlled study of women who underwent a conservative surgery for symptomatic \\"large\\" ( 5 cm in the largest diameter) intramural uterine fibroids. The \\"study group\\" consisted of women who underwent the combined approach (laparoscopic uterine artery bipolar coagulation and simultaneous myomectomy), while women who underwent the traditional laparoscopic myomectomy constituted the \\"control group\\". A comparison between the two groups was performed, and several intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS No significant difference in the overall duration of surgery between women of the \\"study group\\" and \\"control group\\" emerged; however, a significantly shorter surgical time for myomectomy was observed in the \\"study group\\". The intraoperative blood loss and the postoperative haemoglobin drop were significantly lower in the \\"study group\\". No difference in the postoperative pain between groups emerged, and the postoperative hospital stay was similar in the two groups.

Wearable devices including inertial measurement units (IMUs) can overcome these limitations by quantifying digital mobility outcomes (DMOs) both during supervised structured assessments and in real-world conditions. The validity of IMU-based methods in the real-world, however, is still limited in patient populations. Rigorous validation procedures should cover the device metrological verification, the validation of the algorithms for the DMOs computation specifically for the population of interest and in daily life situations, and the users' perspective on the device. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol was designed to establish the technical validity and patient acceptability of the approach used to quantify digital mobility in the real world by Mobilise-D, a consortium funded by the European Union (EU) as part of the Innovative Medicine Initiative, aiming at fostering regulatory approval and clinical adoption of DMOs.After defining the procedures for the metrological verification of an IMU-based device, the experimental procedures for the validation of algorithms used to calculate the DMOs are presented. These include laboratory and real-world assessment in 120 participants from five groups: healthy older adults; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, proximal femoral fracture and congestive heart failure. DMOs extracted from the monitoring device will be compared with those from different reference systems, chosen according to the contexts of observation. Questionnaires and interviews will evaluate the users' perspective on the deployed technology and relevance of the mobility assessment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study has been granted ethics approval by the centre's committees (London-Bloomsbury Research Ethics committee; Helsinki Committee, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Centre; Medical Faculties of The University of Tbingen and of the University of Kiel).

Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is an efficient screening technique via which lung infections can be detected. This paper aims to distinguish COVID-19 positive cases from the other four classes, including normal, tuberculosis (TB), bacterial pneumonia (BP), and viral pneumonia (VP), using CXR images. The existing COVID-19 classification researches have achieved some successes with deep learning techniques while sometimes lacking interpretability and generalization ability. Hence, we propose a two-stage classification method MANet to address these issues in computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis. Particularly, a segmentation model predicts the masks for all CXR images to extract their lung regions at the first stage. A followed classification CNN at the second stage then classifies the segmented CXR images into five classes based only on the preserved lung regions. In this segment-based classification task, we propose the mask attention mechanism (MA) which uses the predicted masks at the first stage as spatial attention maps to adjust the features of the CNN at the second stage. The MA spatial attention maps for features calculate the percentage of masked pixels in their receptive fields, suppressing the feature values based on the overlapping rates between their receptive fields and the segmented lung regions. In evaluation, we segment out the lung regions of all CXR images through a UNet with ResNet backbone, and then perform classification on the segmented CXR images using four classic CNNs with or without MA, including ResNet34, ResNet50, VGG16, and Inceptionv3. The experimental results illustrate that the classification models with MA have higher classification accuracy, more stable training process, and better interpretability and generalization ability than those without MA. Among the evaluated classification models, ResNet50 with MA achieves the highest average test accuracy of 96.32 % in three runs, and the highest one is 97.06 % . Meanwhile, the attention heat maps visualized by Grad-CAM indicate that models with MA make more reliable predictions based on the pathological patterns in lung regions. This further presents the potential of MANet to provide clinicians with diagnosis assistance.","output":"MANet: A Two-stage Deep Learning Method for Classification of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing strategies against the SARS-CoV-2 is currently a main research subject.

RESULTS Clinical data was available for 95% (126/136) of the critically ill cases of influenza. Median age was 44 years, and major co-morbidities were present in 41%. Respiratory support strategies were studied among the 110 adult patients. Supplementary oxygen was sufficient in 15% (16), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) only was used in 20% (22), while transition from NIV to invasive ventilation (IV) was seen in 41% (45). IV was initiated directly in 24% (26). Patients initially treated with NIV had a higher arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of oxygen in inspired gas ratio compared with those primarily treated with IV.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCM assisted in conventional treatment in the treatment of mild and common COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMbase, MEDLINE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, WANFANG DATA, and VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials of TCM assisted in conventional treatment. The RCT research quality was evaluated by Cochrane 5.1.0 bias risk scale and the non-randomized controlled trial research quality was evaluated by Newcastle Ottawa scale, and the statistical analysis was conducted by Revman 5.3 and R software. The bias and sensitivity of the statistical results were analyzed by STATA 14.0. Registration number: CRD42020210619. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included with 7 RCT studies and 8 retrospective cohort studies, involving a total of 1623 patients. Compared with the control group, TCM can improve the main index clinical effective rate (odds ratio [OR] = 2.64, 95% Confidence interval (CI) [1.94,3.59], P < .00001). The results of Begg test (Pr > z = 0.266) and sensitivity analysis showed that the results were relatively stable. Toujie Quwen (OR = 4.9, 95%CI [1.9,14.0]), Shufeng Jiedu (OR = 2.9, 95%CI [1.5,5.7]), and Lianhua Qingwen (OR = 2.4, 95%CI [1.6,3.6]) were with the best. It can also improve the main clinical symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, and the regression time of the 3 symptoms), severe conversion rate, and computed tomography improvement rate. Its safety was not significantly compared with conventional treatment.

Both active site recognition and catalytic function are examined using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamic (QM/MM MD) simulations of camostat and its active metabolite, 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetate (GBPA).

The SARS Surveillance Project (SARS-SP) was established to rapidly implement multiregional SARS surveillance in emergency departments (EDs) by using existing Internet-based tools. OBJECTIVES The objectives of SARS-SP were to 1) disseminate and update SARS screening forms for ED triage, 2) establish surveillance for SARS syndrome elements by using Regional Emergency Medicine Internet (REMI), 3) expand surveillance to multiple regions, and 4) evaluate the usefulness of Internet tools for agile surveillance during a rapidly emerging global epidemic. METHODS SARS-SP developed, distributed, and updated an Internet-based triage form to identify patients for infection control and public health reporting. EDs then were invited to report visit frequencies with various SARS syndrome elements to local public health authorities by using the REMI Internet application (first in one metropolitan area, and later in four). After pilot-testing in one metropolitan area, the surveillance system was implemented in three others. RESULTS Active syndromic surveillance was established by health departments in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Denver, Colorado; Akron, Ohio; and Fort Worth, Texas. A total of 27 EDs reported syndrome frequencies from >146,000 patient encounters.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, neutralising activity and T cell responses were assessed at baseline and 3 weeks after revaccination and also evaluated seprarately in rituximab (RTX) and non-RTX exposed patients. RESULTS: 66 non-responders were recruited, 33 treated with RTX, and 33 non-exposed to RTX. Overall, 49.2% patients seroconverted and 50.0% developed neutralising antibody activity. Seroconversion (78.8% vs 18.2%) and neutralising activity (80.0% vs 21.9%) was higher in non-RTX than RTX-treated patients with IMID, respectively.

However, previous studies have indicated that methodological problems are frequent in PDSA-based QI projects. Furthermore, it has been difficult to establish an association between the use of PDSA and improvements in clinical practices and patient outcomes. The aim of this systematic review was to examine whether recently published PDSA-based QI projects show self-reported effects and are conducted according to key features of the method. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase and CINAHL databases. QI projects using PDSA published in peer-reviewed journals in 2015 and 2016 were included. Projects were assessed to determine the reported effects and the use of the following key methodological features; iterative cyclic method, continuous data collection, small-scale testing and use of a theoretical rationale. RESULTS Of the 120 QI projects included, almost all reported improvement (98%). However, only 32 (27%) described a specific, quantitative aim and reached it. A total of 72 projects (60%) documented PDSA cycles sufficiently for inclusion in a full analysis of key features. Of these only three (4%) adhered to all four key methodological features. CONCLUSION Even though a majority of the QI projects reported improvements, the widespread challenges with low adherence to key methodological features in the individual projects pose a challenge for the legitimacy of PDSA-based QI.

METHODS: We reviewed cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis reported to the US National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System in 2020. For each STD, we compare the number of 2020 cases reported for a given Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) week to the number of 2019 cases reported in the same week, expressing 2020 cases as a percentage of 2019 cases. We also calculated the percent difference between 2020 and 2019 cumulative case totals as of MMWR week 50 (week of December 9). RESULTS: During MMWR weeks 1 to 11 (week of December 29, 2019CMarch 11, 2020), the weekly number of cases of STDs reported in 2020 as a percentage of the cases in the same week in 2019 was similar.

After panning, a specific clone RFL11 was isolated for characterization in advance. The binding activity and specificity of RFL11 to IgG Fc fragment were comparable to those of RFs previously isolated. The analysis with existed RF-Fc complex structures indicated the homology model of RFL11 is similar to IgM RF61 complex with high binding affinity of about 6  10(?8) M. This effect resulted from longer complementarity-determining region (CDR) combining key somatic mutations. In the RFL11-Fc interfaces, the CDR-H3 loop forms a finger-like structure extending into the bottom of Fc pocket and resulting in strong ion and cation-pi interactions. Moreover, a process of antigen-driven maturation was proven by somatically mutated VH residues on H2 and H3 CDR loops in the interfaces. Taken together, these results suggested that high affinity IgG RFs can be generated in patients with Sj?gren's syndrome and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease.","output":"Isolation, Characterization, and Molecular Modeling of a Rheumatoid Factor from a Hepatitis C Virus Infected Patient with Sj?gren's Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advanced age, male sex and chronic comorbidities are associated with severe COVID-19. However, these general risk factors cannot explain why critical illness occurs in young and apparently healthy individuals. In the past months, several publications have identified susceptibility loci and genes using comprehensive GWAS studies or genome, exome or candidate genes analysis. A recent study reported rare, loss-of-function TLR7 variants in otherwise healthy young brother pairs from two families with severe COVID-19. We aimed to prospectively study the prevalence of rare X-chromosomal TLR7 genetic variants in our cohort of young male patients with severe COVID-19. We recruited 13 patients []50 years who had no risk factors known to be associated with severe disease. We studied the entire TLR7 coding region and identified two missense variants (p.Asn215Ser, c.644A>G and p.Trp933Arg, c.2797T>C) in two out of 13 cases (15.4%). These variants were not previously reported in population control databases (gnomAD) and were predicted to be damaging by all in silico predictors. The male index patients were between 25 and 30 years old and had no apparent comorbidities. The TLR7 p.Asn215Ser co-segregated in 2 first-degree relatives severely affected by COVID-19, in a younger previously healthy the variant was found in hemizygous state , and in an older than 60 was in heterozygous state. No family members were available for testing the segregation of the p.Trp933Arg variant. These results further support that susceptibility to severe COVID-19 could be determined by inherited rare genetic variants in TLR7. Understanding the causes and mechanisms of life-threatening COVID-19 is crucial and could lead to novel preventive and therapeutic options. This study supports a rationale for the genetic screening for TLR7 variants in young men with severe COVID-19 in the absence of other relevant risk factors. A diagnosis of TLR7 deficiency could not only inform on treatment options for the patient, but it also enables for pre-symptomatic testing of at-risk male relatives with the possibility of instituting early preventive and therapeutic interventions.","output":"Genetic screening for TLR7 variants in young and previously healthy men with severe COVID-19: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments installed measures to contain the disease.

Tissue mobilization was evaluated via ultrasound images of LDT and backfat thickness (BFT) at 21 and 7 d BEC as well as at 0, 10, 30, and 60 DIM. Plasma concentrations of 3-methylhistidine (3-MH), creatinine (CRE), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and -hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were evaluated weekly.

Between 35 and 21 d BEC, LM cows gained LDT, whereas HM cows gained BFT. HM cows mobilized more muscle from 21 d BEC to 30 DIM, as reflected by a greater loss of LDT, greater 3-MH concentrations (532 vs. 438  30 ng/mL), and a greater 3-MH:CRE ratio (0.164 vs. 0.131  0.008) in the first three weeks postpartum.

The relationship between poverty and race is complex, with a diverse set of structural and systemic factors driving higher rates of poverty among minority populations. The factors that specifically contribute to the disproportionate rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, are not clearly understood. METHODS: We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 test results from community-based testing sites in Los Angeles, California, between June and December, 2020. We used tester zip code data to link those results with United States Census report data on average annual household income, rates of healthcare coverage, and employment status by zip code. RESULTS: We analyzed 2 141 127 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 245 154 (11.4%) were positive. Multivariable modeling showed a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among Hispanic communities than among other races. We found an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 positivity among individuals from zip codes with an average annual household income <US$65 000 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72 to 1.82), as well as from zip codes with <85% of individuals with health insurance (aOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33), and <60% of individuals employed (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.44).

To adapt to late spring arrival at northern latitudes, a lower photoperiodic sensitivity and therefore a higher critical photoperiod for reproductive onset is necessary in northern species to arrest reproductive development until spring onset. Temperature-photoperiod relationships, and hence food availability-photoperiod relationships, are highly latitude dependent. Therefore, we predict PNES sensitivity characteristics to be latitude-dependent. Here, we investigated photoperiodic responses at different times during development in northern- (tundra/root vole, Microtus oeconomus) and southern vole species (common vole, Microtus arvalis) exposed to constant short (SP) or long photoperiod (LP). M. oeconomus grows faster under LP, whereas no photoperiodic effect on somatic growth is observed in M. arvalis. Contrastingly, gonadal growth is more sensitive to photoperiod in M. arvalis, suggesting that photoperiodic responses in somatic and gonadal growth can be plastic, and might be regulated through different mechanisms. In both species, thyroid-stimulating-hormone- subunit (Tsh) and iodothyronine-deiodinase 2 (Dio2) expression is highly increased under LP, whereas Tshr and Dio3 decreases under LP. High Tshr levels in voles raised under SP may lead to increased sensitivity to increasing photoperiods later in life. The higher photoperiodic induced Tshr response in M. oeconomus suggests that the northern vole species might be more sensitive to TSH when raised under SP. Species differences in developmental programming of the PNES, which is dependent on photoperiod early in development, may form part divergent breeding strategies evolving as part of latitudinal adaptation. Summary statement Development of the neuroendocrine system driving photoperiodic responses in gonadal and somatic growth differ between the common and the tundra vole, indicating that they use a different breeding strategy.","output":"Gonads or body?

There are no data on critically ill patients with COVID-19 who did not meet criteria for ICU admission. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed patients admitted to the ICU and those ineligible for ICU admission in a large COVID-19-dedicated hospital, during the first 3 months of the pandemic in Poland. Data from 67 patients considered for ICU admissions due to COVID-19 infection, treated between 10 March and 10 June 2020, were reviewed. Following exclusions, data on 32 patients admitted to the ICU and 21 patients ineligible for ICU admission were analyzed. RESULTS In 38% of analyzed patients, symptoms of COVID-19 infection occurred during a hospital stay for an unrelated medical issue. The mean age of ICU patients was 62.4 (10.4) years, and the majority of patients were male (69%), with at least one comorbidity (88%). The mean admission APACHE II and SAPS II scores were 20.1 (8.1) points and 51.2 (15.3) points, respectively. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and Clinical Frailty Scale were lower in ICU patients compared with those disqualified: 5.9 (4.3) vs. 9.1 (3.5) points, P=0.01, and 4.7 (1.7) vs. 6.9 (1.2) points, P<0.01, respectively. All ICU patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation. ICU mortality was 67%. Hospital mortality among patients admitted to the ICU and those who were disqualified was 70% and 79%, respectively.

Nutritional assessment should identify those patients at high nutritional risk, determined by both disease severity and nutritional status. For such patients if they are unable to maintain volitional intake, enteral access should be attained and enteral nutrition (EN) initiated within 24-48 h of admission. Orogastric or nasogastric feeding is most appropriate when starting EN, switching to post-pyloric or deep jejunal feeding only in those patients who are intolerant of gastric feeds or at high risk for aspiration. Percutaneous access should be used for those patients anticipated to require EN for >4 weeks. Patients receiving EN should be monitored for risk of aspiration, tolerance, and adequacy of feeding (determined by percent of goal calories and protein delivered). Intentional permissive underfeeding (and even trophic feeding) is appropriate temporarily for certain subsets of hospitalized patients. Although a standard polymeric formula should be used routinely in most patients, an immune-modulating formula (with arginine and fish oil) should be reserved for patients who have had major surgery in a surgical ICU setting. Adequacy of nutrition therapy is enhanced by establishing nurse-driven enteral feeding protocols, increasing delivery by volume-based or top-down feeding strategies, minimizing interruptions, and eliminating the practice of gastric residual volumes. Parenteral nutrition should be used in patients at high nutritional risk when EN is not feasible or after the first week of hospitalization if EN is not sufficient.

Drawing causal inferences from the measures of association reported in ecological studies is fraught with challenges given biases arising from an outcome whose ascertainment is incomplete, varies by region, time, and across sociodemographic characteristics, and cannot account for clustering or within-area heterogeneity. Through a series of analyses, we illustrate the dangers of using ecological studies to assess whether ambient air pollution increases the risk of dying from, or transmitting, COVID-19. Methods: We performed an ecological analysis in the continental United States using county-level ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) between 2000 and 2016 and cumulative COVID-19 mortality counts through June 2020, December 2020, and April 2021. To show that spurious associations can be obtained in ecological data, we modeled the association between PM2.5 and the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We fitted negative binomial models, with a logarithmic offset for county-specific population, to these data. Natural cubic splines were used to describe the shape of the exposure-response curves. Results: Our analyses revealed that the shape of the exposure-response curve between PM2.5 and COVID-19 changed substantially over time. Analyses of COVID-19 mortality through June 30, 2021, suggested a positive linear relationship. In contrast, an inverse pattern was observed using county-level concentrations of PM2.5 and the prevalence of HIV.

Three of 7 patients (29%) had 3 prior therapies. The median time on treatment was 22 days (range 8-1361 days). The most common adverse events of any grade were: constipation, fatigue, nausea (each 3/7 pts, 43%) and abdominal pain, diarrhea, lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease, skin infection, tumor pain, and vomiting (each 2/7 pts, 29%). Most were Grade 1 and Grade 2. The Grade 3 adverse events were fatigue, lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease (each 1/7 pts, 14%) and tumor pain (2/7 pts, 29%). One Grade 4 lymphocyte count decrease was reported. Two patients had a serious adverse event (Grade 3 syncope and Grade 3 tumor pain). Two patients had dosing held for an adverse event;however, no patient withdrew from treatment due to any adverse events. One death occurred due to disease progression. Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis showed significant reduction of MYC, PCNA, and MCL-1 mRNA in all patients across multiple timepoints. Antitumor activity consisted of 2 complete metabolic responses in 7 patients (29%) based on investigator-assessed FDG-PET scans. Due to the COVID pandemic, the patients withdrew consent after 3.7 and 2.3 years, respectively, of treatment. Both patients were in complete metabolic response. Conclusions: VIP152 had a manageable safety profile, on-target pharmacodynamic activity and signs of durable monotherapy antitumor activity in patients with DHL. These encouraging results warrant further evaluation of VIP152 in patients with MYCdriven lymphoma and solid tumors.","output":"Safety and efficacy of VIP152, a CDK9 inhibitor, in patients with double-hit lymphoma (DHL)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mammalian chromosomes are organized into megabase-sized compartments that are further subdivided into topologically associated domains (TADs). While the formation of TADs is dependent on Cohesin, the mechanism behind compartmentalization remains enigmatic. Here, we show that the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family scaffold protein BRD2 promotes spatial mixing and compartmentalization of active chromatin after Cohesin loss. This activity is independent of transcription but requires BRD2 to recognize acetylated targets through its double bromodomain and interact with binding partners with its low complexity domain. Notably, genome compartmentalization mediated by BRD2 is antagonized on one hand by Cohesin and on the other by the BET homolog protein BRD4, both of which inhibit BRD2 binding to chromatin. Polymer simulation of our data supports a BRD2-Cohesin interplay model of nuclear topology, where genome compartmentalization results from a competition between loop extrusion and chromatin state-specific affinity interactions.","output":"BRD2 Compartmentalizes the Accessible Genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the understanding of community to families living in insecure housing in one Australian state during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Five female\\\\headed families were interviewed during the pandemic and asked to identify what community meant to them. All participants were referred by an agency caring for families experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity. Community was defined using Bourdieu's concept of social capital, allowing for both bonding and bridging relationships to be explored. Bonding relationships refer to close emotional ties with family and friends, while bridging ties establish networks that provide individuals with access to resources. Two themes emerged that shed light on how community is understood during times of crisis: The first suggests that for families experiencing housing insecurity, particularly women escaping family violence, their links with community were primarily maintained by welfare and church agencies. These organisations provided bridging social capital during the pandemic that allowed the women and their children to cope with the isolation and to maximise opportunities. The second themes point to traditional notions of community as family and geographical space. Here the findings are mixed. Resources provided by government, and mediated through the welfare agency, allowed these families to create a safe and comfortable space. However, for First Nations women, the lockdown meant that it was difficult to maintain community obligations, while children who appeared to identify community with attendance at school found the lockdown confusing because of the disruption to their normal social space.","output":"Where is community during COVID\\\\19?

For the period 1990-2017, EU-Japan security cooperation is mapped for a broad range of security domains. During this period, cooperation has increased notably in domains such as economic security, cyber-security and civil protection. In other areas, such as military, regional, energy and human security as well as terrorism, the scope of cooperation lags behind.

A questionnaire was prepared and distributed among students participating in both educational systems to conduct this descriptive study. The data extracted from 400 returned questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistical methods using SPSS and MATLAB software. The paper results showed that the scores obtained by students in IoT-based tests were higher than traditional tests.

More information on duration and prevalence of these symptoms in non-hospitalized populations is needed. MethodsWe conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study including 152 880 individuals aged 15-years or older, consisting of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases between September 2020-April 2021 (N=61 002) and a corresponding test-negative control group (N=91 878). Data were collected 6, 9 or 12 months after the test using web-based questionnaires. The questionnaire covered acute and post-acute symptoms, selected diagnoses, sick leave and general health, together with demographics and life style at baseline. Risk differences (RDs) between test-positives and -negatives were reported, adjusted for age, sex, single comorbidities, Charlson comorbidity score, obesity and healthcare-occupation. FindingsSix to twelve months after the test date, the risks of 18 out of 21 physical symptoms were elevated among test-positives and one third (29.6%) of the test-positives experienced at least one physical post-acute symptom. The largest risk differences were observed for dysosmia (RD = 10.92%, 95%CI 10.68-11.21%), dysgeusia (RD=8.68%, 95%CI 8.43-8.93%), fatigue/exhaustion (RD=8.43%, 95%CI 8.14-8.74%), dyspnea (RD=4.87%, 95%CI 4.65-5.09%) and reduced strength in arms/legs (RD=4.68%, 95%CI 4.45-4.89%). More than half (53.1%) of test-positives reported at least one of the following conditions: concentration difficulties (RD=28.34%, 95%CI 27.34-28.78%), memory issues (RD=27.25%, 95%CI 26.80-27.71%), sleep problems (RD=17.27%, 95%CI 16.81-17.73%), mental (RD=32.58%, 95%CI 32.11-33.09%) or physical exhaustion (RD=40.45%, 95%CI 33.99-40.97%), compared to 11.5% of test-negatives. New diagnoses of anxiety (RD=1.15%, 95%CI 0.95-1.34%) or depression (RD=1.00%, 95%CI 0.81-1.19%) were also more common among test-positives. InterpretationAt the population-level, where the majority of test-positives (96.0%) were not hospitalized during acute infection, a considerable proportion experience post-acute symptoms and sequelae 6-12 months after infection. FundingNone Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before the studyC_ST_ABSTo identify existing studies on the epidemiology and clinical nature of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, we searched PubMed for articles published until January 4, 2022 using the search string (((SARS-CoV-2[Title/Abstract]) OR (COVID-19[Title/Abstract]) OR (coronavirus[Title/Abstract])) AND ((post-acute[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"post acute\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"long haul*\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"long-term symptoms\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"long-term disease\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"long-term illness\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"persistent symptoms\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"persistent disease\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"persistent illness\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"prolonged symptoms\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"prolonged disease\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"prolonged illness\\"[Title/Abstract]))) OR (long-covid[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"Post-COVID-19 syndrome\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"Post-COVID-19 condition\\"[Title/Abstract]) OR (\\"Post-COVID-19 symptoms\\"[Title/Abstract]). This resulted in 870 articles. When screening these, we focused on articles covering symptoms comprehensively or a broader area, e.g. mental health problems, rather than in-depth studies of symptoms within a single area, case stories or studies focusing on clinical management. A very wide range of post-acute symptoms originating from many different organ systems have been reported. This includes pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematologic, gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, dermatologic, neurological and cognitive symptoms, as well as more general health problems, in particular fatigue. Based on two systematic reviews covering the period December 2019-March 2021, the majority of studies of persistent COVID-19 symptoms had until then been conducted among hospitalized patients and thus were not representative of the general population, where the majority will only have suffered mild or moderate disease. Since then some larger register-based studies as well as some smaller questionnaire- or interview-based studies have been conducted among non-hospitalized patients. Both types of studies offer advantages and disadvantages in relation to obtaining the full overview of long-term effects. Register-based studies are best suited for capturing more severe conditions confirmed by a trained physician and defined by diagnostic classification schemes, whereas questionnaires including self-reported symptoms are able to capture symptoms and health outcomes that do not easily confirm to disease diagnoses, but which are nevertheless critical to our understanding of the burden of post-acute symptoms. The number of sstudies of post-acute conditions among non-hospitalized patients with a follow-up time of more than 6 months is still limited. Some of the major remaining knowledge gaps regarding post-acute symptoms are: 1) What is the prevalence and variety of post-acute symptoms in the general population of infected persons, where the majority will only have suffered mild or moderate disease, 2) For how long do post-acute symptoms persist, and 3) Which subgroups of individuals, if any, are at higher risk of post-acute symptoms. Added value of this studyThe present nationwide questionnaire-study is based on a large, mainly adult study population (N=152 880), where all individuals in Denmark, who tested positive during the study period, were invited to participate along with comparable test-negative controls. Marked levels of post-acute symptoms and conditions were reported with changes in sense of smell and taste being the most frequently reported single physical symptoms. As many as half (53.1%) of the participants report having experienced general health problems in the form of either mental or physical exhaustion, sleep problems or cognitive problems, compared to 11.5% of control persons 6 to 12 months after the test. Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of the general population, who did not experience severe disease, are still affected 6 to 12 months after infection and that post-acute symptoms are more often experienced by females and middle-aged individuals. Implications of all available evidenceDiverse post-acute symptoms following infection with SARS-CoV-2 occur frequently. Even up to 12 months after the onset of infection, a considerable proportion of individuals, who did not experience severe disease, continue to experience symptoms. Post-acute symptoms are generally more often reported by females than males, whereas the influence of age remains unclear.","output":"Post-acute symptoms, new onset diagnoses and health problems 6 to 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection: a nationwide questionnaire study in the adult Danish population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Poor sleep may contribute to chronic kidney disease (CKD) through several pathways, including hypoxia-induced systemic and intraglomerular pressure, inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. However, few studies have investigated the association between multiple objectively measured sleep dimensions and CKD. METHODS We investigated the cross-sectional association between sleep dimensions and CKD among 1895 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Sleep Ancillary Study participants who completed in-home polysomnography, wrist actigraphy and a sleep questionnaire. Using Poisson regression models with robust variance, we estimated separate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% CIs for moderate-to-severe CKD (glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria >30 mg/g) among participants according to multiple sleep dimensions, including very short (5 hours) sleep, Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index and sleep apnoea-specific hypoxic burden (SASHB) (total area under the respiratory event-related desaturation curve divided by total sleep duration, %min/hour)). Regression models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviours and clinical characteristics. RESULTS Of the 1895 participants, mean age was 68.29.1 years, 54% were women, 37% were white, 28% black, 24% Hispanic/Latino and 11% Asian. Several sleep metrics were associated with higher adjusted PR of moderate-to-severe CKD: very short versus recommended sleep duration (PR=1.40, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.83); SASHB (Box-Cox transformed SASHB: PR=1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.12); and for participants in the highest quintile of SASHB plus sleep apnoea: PR=1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.63.

Although these patients typically report relatively high pain intensity, the clinical course of their pain and disability remains unclear. Our objective was to review the literature and describe the clinical course of non-specific low back pain after an ED visit. METHODS: Electronic searches were conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE from inception to March 2019. We screened for cohort studies or randomised trials investigating pain or disability in patients with non-specific low back pain presenting to EDs. We excluded studies that enrolled participants with minimal pain or disability scores at baseline. Two reviewers independently screened the full texts, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias and quality of evidence. Estimates of pain and disability were converted to a common 0-100 scale. We estimated pooled means and 95% CIs of pain and disability as a function of time since ED presentation. RESULTS: Eight studies (nine publications) with a total of 1994 patients provided moderate overall quality evidence of the expected clinical course of low back pain after an ED visit. Seven of the eight studies were assessed to have a low risk of bias. At the time of the ED presentation, the pooled estimate of the mean pain score on a 0-100 scale was 71.0 (95% CI 64.2-77.9). This reduced to 46.1 (95% CI 37.2-55.0) after 1 day, 41.8 (95% CI 34.7 to 49.0) after 1 week and 13.5 (95% CI 5.8-21.3) after 26 weeks. The course of disability followed a similar pattern.

Of 408 patients with CAP, pathogens were detected in 263 patients (64.5%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza A virus were the most frequently identified bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively. Age had a significant effect on the prediction of aetiology (P = 0.054), with an increase in the relative contribution of viruses with advancing age. Multivariate analyses further showed that the presence of cough increased the likelihood of detecting a viral pathogen [odds ratio (OR) 5.536, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.130-14.390], the presence of immunodeficiency decreased the likelihood of detecting a bacterial pathogen (OR 0.595, 95 % CI 0.246-1.437) and an increase in pneumonia severity index score increased the likelihood of detecting a pathogen in general.

However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID).

Because coagulopathy caused by COVID-19 has been difficult to control, it is important to have a better understanding of what therapies have been studied thus far and what therapies have demonstrated better outcomes for hospitalized patients. This review is focused on literature, research, and expert clinical judgments published in 2020 with a few references to articles published earlier. The review introduces the interim guidelines of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) for management of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy, discusses the efficacy of these guidelines in clinical settings, and summarizes the response of the scientific community to these guidelines and their clinical implications. Due to the failure of patients to respond to the prophylactic doses of heparin recommended by ISTH, higher doses of heparin may be necessary to achieve adequate anticoagulation. Patients resistance to prophylactic doses of heparin could be due to low levels of anti-thrombin and high levels of fibrinogen, which would reinforce the use of therapeutic doses of heparin in the early stages of hospitalization. The review also compares low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) as anticoagulant choices for COVID-19 patients. Given the complications specific to COVID-19, UFH may be a better choice of anticoagulant. Outpatient anticoagulation options are also reviewed. Changing qualified patients from vitamin K antagonists (VKA) to direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for the convenience of less frequent monitoring may be appropriate. New anticoagulant, nafamostat, used in Japan is also discussed as a possible potentiate for heparin therapy.","output":"Anticoagulation Options for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Induced Coagulopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Constructing photocatalytic materials into three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) is considered an effective strategy for improving mass transfer behaviors and shortening the electron migration path. However, this strategy is challenging for ternary semiconductors because they cannot be directly synthesized by traditional thermal decomposition methods. Ternary systems need to face the structural instability caused by the construction of macroporous morphology, which limits the application of the ordered macroporous structure. In this work, we designed a novel and efficient two-step crystal nucleation strategy for constructing a highly stable ternary ordered macroporous structure. Here, 3DOM NaTaO3 was reported as a promising candidate. Compared with nonporous NaTaO3, which has no catalytic activity in pure water, 807.9 and 280.1 mol g-1h-1 of H2 and H2O2 production rates were first achieved on the 3DOM NaTaO3. Furthermore, the rate of photocatalytic H2 evolution over the 3DOM NaTaO3 improved sharply to 3.9 mmol g-1h-1 in methanol aqueous solution, which was 139 times that of nonporous NaTaO3. The construction of 3DOM NaTaO3 enables the participation of the bulk interior in photochemical reaction and provides more options for later decoration. This work opens a new door for constructing more 3DOM ternary semiconductors for catalytic reactions.","output":"Three-dimensionally ordered Macroporous perovskite sodium tantalum for robust hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The case is presented of a 29-year-old primiparous woman who was COVID-19-positive at 34a?weeks of gestation and who developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Materials and Methods: Ten lymphoma patients with pneumonia and 12 patients with COVID-19 infections were enrolled from January 15 to March 14, 2020. The clinical features were recorded. All pulmonary lesions on chest CT were assessed for location, shape, density and diffusion degree. Other typical CT features were also evaluated. Results: The most commonly observed patchy lesions were ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and mixed GGOs in both groups. Regarding the diffusion degree, 82% (92/112) of the lesions in the COVID-19 group were relatively limited, while 69% (52/75) of those in the lymphoma group were diffuse (p < 0.001). The proportions of interlobular septal thickening, vascular thickening, pleural involvement and fibrous stripes observed in the lymphoma cases were statistically compatible with those observed in the COVID-19 cases (p > 0.05). Air bronchograms were observed more frequently in COVID-19 patients (45%, 50/112) than in lymphoma patients with pneumonia (5%, 4/75) (p < 0.001). Halo sign (6%) and reversed halo sign (1%) were observed in several COVID-19 patients but not in lymphoma-associated pneumonia patients. Conclusion: Both lymphoma-associated pneumonia and COVID-19 generally manifested as patchy GGOs and mixed GGOs in more than one lobe. Compared to COVID-19, lymphoma-associated pneumonia tended to be relatively diffuse, with fewer air bronchograms, and no halo or reversed halo signs observed on chest CT.","output":"Comparison of Chest CT Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Pneumonia Associated with Lymphoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new 501Y.V2 variant of COVID-19 has led to a rapid increase in the number of persons infected with the virus in South Africa, and state and private hospitals are having to turn patients away.

In recent years, AGNHW has been commonly used for the treatment of ischemic stroke, but the mechanism by which AGNHW relieves stroke has not been clearly elucidated. In the current study, we developed a multiple systems pharmacology-based framework to identify the potential antistroke ingredients in AGNHW and explore the underlying mechanisms of action (MOA) of AGNHW against stroke from a holistic perspective. Specifically, we performed a network-based method to identify the potential antistroke ingredients in AGNHW by integrating the drug-target network and stroke-associated genes. Furthermore, the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was used to validate the anti-inflammatory effects of the key ingredients by determining the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-. The antiapoptotic effects of the key ingredients were also confirmed in vitro. Integrated pathway analysis of AGNHW revealed that it might regulate three biological signaling pathways, including IL-17, TNF, and PI3K-AKT, to play a protective role in stroke. Moreover, 30 key antistroke ingredients in AGNHW were identified via network-based in silico prediction and were confirmed to have known neuroprotective effects. After drug-like property evaluation and pharmacological validation in vitro, scutellarein (SCU) and caprylic acid (CA) were selected for further antistroke investigation. Finally, systems pharmacology-based analysis of CA and SCU indicated that they might exert antistroke effects via the apoptotic signaling pathway and inflammatory response, which was further validated in an in vitro stroke model. Overall, the current study proposes an integrative systems pharmacology approach to identify antistroke ingredients and demonstrate the underlying pharmacological MOA of AGNHW in stroke, which provides an alternative strategy to investigate novel traditional Chinese medicine formulas for complex diseases.","output":"In Silico Identification and Mechanism Exploration of Active Ingredients against Stroke from An-Gong-Niu-Huang-Wan (AGNHW) Formula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease has taken a toll on everyone's lives either physically or emotionally throughout the world.

Considering that macrophages are essential for tissue homeostasis and inflammation, we sought to examine the functional impact of NAMPT in inflammatory macrophages, particularly in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, we show that mice with NAMPT deletion within the myeloid compartment (Namptf/fLysMCre+/-, Nampt mKO) have more pronounced colitis with lower survival rates, as well as numerous uncleared apoptotic corpses within the mucosal layer. Nampt-deficient macrophages exhibit reduced phagocytic activity due to insufficient NAD+ abundance, which is required to produce NADPH for the oxidative burst. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) treatment rescues NADPH levels in Nampt mKO macrophages and sustains superoxide generation via NADPH oxidase. Consequently, Nampt mKO mice fail to clear dead cells during tissue repair, leading to substantially prolonged chronic colitis. Moreover, systemic administration of NMN, to supply NAD+, effectively suppresses the disease severity of DSS-induced colitis. Collectively, our findings suggest that activation of the NAMPT-dependent NAD+ biosynthetic pathway, via NMN administration, is a potential therapeutic strategy for managing inflammatory diseases.","output":"NAMPT mitigates colitis severity by supporting redox-sensitive activation of phagocytosis in inflammatory macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of studies on intermittent fasting in Saudi Arabia outside of Ramadan. The aim of this research was to study and describe the practice of intermittent fasting outside of Ramadan among Saudi people. METHODS: A web-based survey that focused on intermittent fasting practicesspecifically the use of intermittent fasting applications, goal setting, and the effects of fasting on an individuals state of healthwas administered, collected, and analyzed. RESULTS: The study revealed that 58% (298/514) of the respondents practiced intermittent fasting for a duration of less than 3 months. The most-practiced pattern of intermittent fasting was a 16/8 fasting pattern (43.8%, 225/514). About 88.3% (454/514) of those who followed intermittent fasting drank fluids while fasting. Additionally, the amount of weight loss after intermittent fasting was less than 2.2 kg for 35% (180/514) of the participants. The primary goal of intermittent fasting for 44.9% (231/514) of the respondents was to lose weight. The majority of the participants (84.6%, 435/514) did not use any fasting applications.

The objective of this study was to estimate to what extent the increased risk among people with diabetes could impact the secondary care costs of COVID-19 throughout Europe during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from January to June 2020. METHODS Applying a health care cost model based on inputs from data published in international peer-reviewed journals, identified via a rapid literature review this study aimed to estimate the total secondary sector costs of COVID-19. Estimates of unit costs were based on data from Denmark, France, Spain and the UK. We calculated average costs per patient without diabetes and according to four diabetes categories based on risk of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit, ventilator support and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The estimated cost per hospital admission during the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe ranged between EUR 25,018 among people with type 2 diabetes in good glycaemic control to EUR 57,244 among people with type 1 diabetes in poor glycaemic control, reflecting higher risk of intensive care, ventilator support and longer hospital stay according to diabetes category, while the corresponding cost for people without diabetes was estimated at EUR 16,993. The total direct costs of secondary care of COVID-19 in Europe were estimated at EUR 13.9 billion. Thus, 23.5% of the total costs accounted for treating people with diabetes.

During the last two decades, three outbreaks of coronavirus-associated pneumonia, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome, and the ongoing Coronavirus Infectious Disease-2019 (COVID-19) were reported. The rate of diagnosis of viral pneumonia is increasingly approaching 60% among children identified as having community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Clinical presentation ranges from mild to severe pneumonitis complicated by respiratory failure in severe cases. The most vulnerable patients, the elderly and those living with cancer, report a relevant mortality rate. No clinical characteristics can be useful to conclusively distinguish the different etiology of viral pneumonia. However, accessory symptoms, such as anosmia or ageusia together with respiratory symptoms suggest COVID-19. An etiologic-based treatment of viral pneumonia is possible in a small percentage of cases only. Neuraminidase inhibitors have been proven to reduce the need for ventilatory support and mortality rate while only a few data support the large-scale use of other antivirals. A low-middle dose of dexamethasone and heparin seems to be effective in COVID-19 patients, but data regarding their possible efficacy in viral pneumonia caused by other viruses are conflicting. In conclusion, viral pneumonia is a relevant cause of CAP, whose interest is increasing due to the current COVID-19 outbreak.

Although some of these measures have proven efficacious, many bring with them adverse effects on fundamental rights and liberties which necessitate regulatory and policy monitoring. This project is interested in scrutinizing and critically evaluating the discriminatory consequences of adopted COVID control measures on vulnerable groups in society, thereby positively influencing anti-discrimination policy outcomes and resilience-building across communities.The project suggests that early risk prediction (and response activation) based on identifiable pre-existing social and economic vulnerabilities will reduce the necessity for constrained control responses. Prompt predictive intervention by the State will lessen the associated discriminatory outcomes that arise from pre-existing societal neglect of vulnerable populations and the infliction of intrusive control measures as a regressive policy/regulatory alternative. By further scrutinizing the control measures employed within our various jurisdictions of interest, the project aims to shed light on the interplay between discriminatory State responses and the exacerbation of pre-existing vulnerability features. Through this mapping exercise, the research will facilitate the promotion of more appropriate, ethical and equitable control strategies. The flattening of these pandemic healthcare inequalities will have positive ramifications for human dignity, autonomy, and rights across numerous vulnerable communities including migrant workers, the elderly, and racial minorities. Additionally, the economic benefits in maintaining productivity and reducing intervention costs can be significant. The amelioration of discriminatory outcomes will also enhance and restore public confidence and trust in their respective State authorities leading to more effective pandemic containment. This project will be broken down into several distinct parts. This opening paper applies a theoretical understanding of vulnerability and the vulnerable human condition to a specific use-case. Migrant construction workers living and working in Singapore form the subject of our first empirical exercise. After evaluating the distinct features of Singapore migrant workers pre-existing vulnerabilities, the paper examines government control responses directed to this community and discusses potential discriminatory impacts.

SARS-CoV-2 was found to cause the severe respiratory syndrome, and on January 22, 2020 first human-to-human transmission was reported. We aimed to reveal the complete genomes of 19 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Denizli province and identify Turkish patients' genetic similarities. METHODOLOGY: 15 samples with the highest viral loads resulting from RT-PCR were selected for NGS analysis. Fifteen SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis and uploaded to the GISAID database. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method using MEGAX software. RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA samples revealed 32 missense, 21 synonymous, and 4 non-coding alleles. In all samples c.1-25C>T (5'UTR), c.14144C>T (ORF1ab), c.2772C>T (ORF1ab) and c.1841A>G(S) mutations were detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the present study's genomes are in 20B clade while the two are in 20A. The phylogenetic tree constructed with all complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of Turkey showed that the viruses were spread nearly homogenous on eastern (around Kars) and western (around Istanbul) sides. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we reported the viral genomes in Denizli comprehensively for the first time. We identified 11 rare missense mutations in the virus compared to the reference genome.

METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted in anonymous province located in the southwestern part of China. A total of 1624 primary school students aged 7 to 14 years were recruited through a random sampling technique. Subsequently, anonymous survey responses were taken from all students. Multiple serial mediation analysis was performed by using AMOS 21.0 software to attain the primary aim of the study. RESULT: According to the total sample model result, SES has a significant direct effect on the parentCchild relationship ( = 0.47, p < 0.001), childrens participation in VAA1 ( = 0.197, p < 0.001) and VAA2 ( = 0.269, p < 0.001). Moreover, the mediation model result indicates that SES has a stronger indirect effect on the parentCchild relationship through a mediating role of VAA1 ((girl) = 0.08, p < 0.01; (boys) = 0.04, p < 0.01) for female than male samples. However, the mediating effect of VVA2 between SES and the parentCchild relationship in the female ( = 0.08, p < 0.001) and male ( = 0.08, p < 0.01) models is equal, although female gender is highly significant. Ultimately, the serial mediation analysis result affirms that the serially mediating role of VAA1 and VAA2 between SES and the parentCchild relationship was equal across genders ((boys) = 0.001, p < 0.001; (girls) = 0.001, p < 0.001).

METHODS: We have searched databases like PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for articles related to natural products and viral diseases, with a specific focus on coronaviruses, as well as other RNA viruses and recent updates on COVID-19 pandemic, and collected articles and reviewed comprehensively. RESULTS: Scientific studies clarified the viral pathogenesis that involved viral entrance into host cells, and antiviral response inside the cells, which can be effectively targeted by numerous natural compounds from different sources. Many of these compounds can potentially target viral genomic material or protein machinery. Natural products which were found effective against other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (which emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively) might be effective against SARS-CoV-2 due to their structural similarities; however, it needs time to establish the clinical success of these drugs.

In this communication, we report the case of a 56-year-old male, a chronic alcoholic who presented during the lockdown period, with acute bilateral loss of vision following ingestion of ABHR. The handrub was found to be a nonstandardized sanitizer with no labels mentioning its constituents. Typically, the ingestion of ABHR solutions results in isopropanol or ethanol poisoning, both of which have low toxicity. Based on the clinical history and findings in our patient, a diagnosis of optic neuropathy due to accidental ingestion of sanitizer containing methyl alcohol as an unlisted ingredient was made.

We employed a two-wave design with a five-month interval. Data were obtained from 275 employees in Taiwan. The results of latent moderated structural equations (LMS) revealed that long working hours were positively associated with presenteeism, which in turn was negatively related to employees well-being and job performance. Furthermore, the negative indirect effect of working long hours on job performance via presenteeism was weaker for those with a higher intrinsic work value orientation. The negative indirect effect of working long hours on well-being via presenteeism was weaker for those with a higher extrinsic work value orientation. We demonstrated that the long-term impact of presenteeism behavior could be understood by viewing work value orientations as resource gains to compensate resource depletion in a demanding work context. This resource dynamism is pivotal to realizing the functional or dysfunctional outcomes of presenteeism behavior.

Although guidelines specify either Bayesian software or first-order equations may be used to estimate AUC24 , there are currently no large studies directly comparing these methods. OBJECTIVE: To compare calculated vancomycin AUC24 using first-order equations with two drug concentrations at steady state to Bayesian two- and one-concentration estimations. METHODS: This was a single center, retrospective cohort study of 978 adult hospitalized patients receiving intravenous vancomycin between 2017-2019. Patients were included if they received at least 72 hours of vancomycin and had two serum drug concentrations obtained. AUC24 was calculated using first-order analytic (linear), Bayesian two-concentration, and Bayesian one-concentration methods for each patient. The InsightRxTM software platform was used to calculate Bayesian AUC24 . Pearson's correlation and clinical agreement (based on AUC24 classified as subtherapeutic, therapeutic, or supratherapeutic) were used to assess agreement between methods. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess mean difference (MD) and 95% limits of agreement (LOA). RESULTS: Excellent agreement was observed between linear and Bayesian two-concentration methods (r=0.963, clinical agreement=87.4%) and Bayesian two-concentration and one-concentration methods (r=0.931, clinical agreement=88.5%), however, a degree of variability was noted with 95% LOA -99 to 76 (MD=-11.5 mg*hr/L) and -92 to 113 (MD=-10.4 mg*hr/L), for the respective comparisons. The agreement between linear and Bayesian one-concentration approaches was less than prior comparisons (r=0.823, clinical agreement=76.8%), and demonstrated the greatest amount of variability with 95% LOA -197 to 153 (MD=-21.9 mg*hr/L). CONCLUSIONS: Linear and Bayesian two-concentration methods demonstrated high-level agreement with acceptable variability and may be considered comparable to estimate vancomycin AUC24 . As linear and Bayesian one-concentration methods demonstrated significant variability and suboptimal agreement, concerns exist surrounding the interchangeability of these methods in clinical practice, particularly at higher extremes of AUC24 .","output":"Comparison of Bayesian-derived and first-order analytic equations for calculation of vancomycin area under the curve"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine storm and hyperinflammation are associated with increased mortality in COVID-19.

Access to clinical experts is limited and technology screening and assessment methods are thus appealing. However, as traditionally implemented patients were deprived of the benefit of personalized connection with a clinician, which is particularly critical for the prescription and to ensure the adherence to and ultimate success of therapeutic interventions.

However, how MXYG acts against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not known. We investigated the active ingredients and the therapeutic targets of MXYG decoction against COVID-19. METHODS A network pharmacology strategy involving drug-likeness evaluation, prediction of oral bioavailability, network analyses, and virtual molecular docking were used to predict the mechanism of action of MXYG against COVID-19. RESULTS Thirty-three core COVID-19-related targets were identified from 1023 gene targets through analyses of protein- protein interactions. Eighty-six active ingredients of MXYG decoction hit by 19 therapeutic targets were screened out by analyses of a compound-compound target network. Via network topology, three \\"hub\\" gene targets (interleukin (IL-6), caspase-3, IL-4) and three key components (quercetin, formononetin, luteolin) were recognized and verified by molecular docking. Compared with control compounds (ribavirin, arbidol), the docking score of quercetin to the IL-6 receptor was highest, with a score of 5. Furthermore, the scores of three key components to SARS-CoV-2 are large as 4, 5, and 5, respectively, which are even better than those of ribavirin at 3. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that MXYG could prevent and treat COVID-19 through anti-inflammatory and immunity-based actions involving activation of T cells, lymphocytes, and leukocytes, as well as cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, and chemokine signaling pathways.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the teaching offer for oral and maxillofacial surgery at our university during the pandemic and to investigate the students perceptions of the current situation. Methods: : A 38-item questionnaire with five sections (demographic information, lectures, internships, e-learning, and pandemic-related solutions/effects) was created online. Most questions were answered on a 10-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating fully agree/positive and 10 indicating totally disagree/negative. The remaining questions were either answered with yes/no, percent value, or open-ended text responses. All 3 rd -5 th year dental students were invited to voluntarily participate and were sent an anonymous link by email. Results: : A total of 63.7% of the participants had no prior experience with online courses before the pandemic. The students stated that the change from face-to-face to online teaching worked very well in the last two semesters (mean = 2.73, standard deviation = 2.05). Overall, the pandemic had a rather positive influence on the acquisition of theoretical skills and a negative influence on the acquisition of practical skills (p < 0.0001).

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions, and general hesitancy to travel has drastically reduced these missions, thus putting a pause on the exchange of surgical skills and training between countries. Augmented reality (AR) technology can mitigate some of these obstacles. AR technology allows mentors and mentees to work together virtually during a live surgical case. Introduction of AR into surgical mission partnerships allows for the continuation of teamwork mentorship, and learning between international teams. We hypothesize that global urologic surgical training can be successfully undertaken through augmented reality. METHODS: In order to evaluate this, members of our team performed several surgical cases while using the Proximie virtual reality system. The Proximie system includes a console with a camera, display monitor, and supported computer system that allows the mentor to visualize the procedure that is being undertaken in the mentee's home country and provide guidance, both visually and through auditory means, during the operation. RESULTS: Multiple procedures were accomplished with this technology. In this video, we will demonstrate endoscopic as well as open cases with a mentee in Benin and mentors in the United Kingdom and the United States. Mentors were able to guide mentees through entire procedures using the AR technology. The audio capabilities of Proximie permitted real time conversation for direct verbal feedback. Proximie technology's visual component allowed mentors to see multiple views simultaneously including the procedure itself as well as endoscopic, fluoroscopic, and sonographic images. Visual feedback was possible through touch screen capability enabling the mentor to mark and circle specific anatomical locations.

Results: We included 117 studies. The pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress disorder (40% (95%CI 39 to 41%)), followed by anxiety (30%, (30 to 31%)), burnout (28% (26 to 31%)), depression (24% (24 to 25%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13% (13 to 14%)). We identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high-risk environment, specific occupational roles, and lower levels of specialised training and job experience) factors. Four studies reported interventions for frontline HCW: two educational interventions increased confidence in pandemic self-efficacy and in interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty), whereas one multifaceted intervention improved anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty).

Frequencies were analyzed through a paired-sample t-test, and open-ended responses were thematically analyzed. Results revealed, first, that social isolation did not represent a significant change in the composition of the participants social network, but family bonds became the main connection during the period, and other sources of social interaction were kept due to the possibility of interaction through virtual means. Although the frequency of social interactions reduced, their significance increased.

Severe disease following H5N1 influenza infection is often associated with dysregulated host innate immune response also known as cytokine storm but the virological and cellular basis of these responses has not been clearly described. We rescued a series of 6:2 reassortant viruses that combined a PR8 HA/NA pairing with the internal gene segments from human adapted H1N1, H3N2, or avian H5N1 viruses and found that mice infected with the virus with H5N1 internal genes suffered severe weight loss associated with increased lung cytokines but not high viral load. This phenotype did not map to the NS gene segment, and NS1 protein of H5N1 virus functioned as a type I IFN antagonist as efficient as NS1 of H1N1 or H3N2 viruses. Instead we discovered that the internal genes of H5N1 virus supported a much higher level of replication of viral RNAs in myeloid cells in vitro, but not in epithelial cells and that this was associated with high induction of type I IFN in myeloid cells. We also found that in vivo during H5N1 recombinant virus infection cells of haematopoetic origin were infected and produced type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines.

The information used is from databases PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Roses have beneficial healing properties due to their richness of beneficial components, the secondary metabolites as flavonoids (e.g., flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins), fragrant components (essential oils, e.g., monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes), and hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Rose essential oils and extracts with their therapeutic propertiesas respiratory antiseptics, anti-inflammatories, mucolytics, expectorants, decongestants, and antioxidantsare able to act as symptomatic prophylactics and drugs, and in this way alleviate dramatic sufferings during severe diseases.","output":"Rose FlowersA Delicate Perfume or a Natural Healer?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients in Germany are free to seek care from any office-based physician and can always ask for multiple opinions on a diagnosis or treatment. The high density of physicians and the freedom to choose among them without referrals have led to a need for better coordination between the multiple health professionals treating any given patient. The objectives of this study are to (1) identify informal networks of physicians who treat the same patient population, (2) provide these physicians with feedback on their network and patients, using routine data and (3) give the physicians the opportunity to meet one another in facilitated network meetings. METHODS: The Accountable Care Deutschland (ACD) study is a prospective, non-blinded, cluster-randomised trial comprising a process and economic evaluation of informal networks among 12,525 GPs and office-based specialists and their 1.9 million patients. The units of allocation are the informal networks, which will be randomised either to the intervention (feedback and facilitated meetings) or control group (usual care). The informal networks will be generated by identifying connections between office-based physicians using complete datasets from the Regional Associations of Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) Physicians in Hamburg, Schleswig Holstein, North Rhine and Westphalia Lip, as well as data from three large statutory health insurers in Germany. The physicians will (a) receive feedback on selected indicators of their own treatment activity and that of the colleagues in their network and (b) will be invited to voluntary, facilitated network meetings by their Regional Association of SHI physicians. The primary outcome will be ambulatory-care-sensitive hospitalisations at baseline, at the end of the 2-year intervention period, and at six months and at 12 months after the end of the intervention period. Data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle. A pilot study preceded the ACD study. DISCUSSION: Cochrane reviews show that feedback can improve everyday medical practice by shedding light on previously unknown relationships. Providing physicians with information on how they are connected with their colleagues and what the outcomes are of care delivered within their informal networks can help them make these improvements, as well as strengthen their awareness of possible discontinuities in the care they provide.

Consensus statements were developed to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (n = 17), thoracic radiologists (n = 5), and thoracic surgeons (n = 2), was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss and then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A predefined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. RESULTS: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (n = 2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (n = 5), evaluation of intermediate and high-risk lung nodules (n = 4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (n = 1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements according to the voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations in which it was believed to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize nonurgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is appropriate to defer enrollment in lung cancer screening and modify the evaluation of lung nodules due to the added risks from potential exposure and the need for resource reallocation. There are multiple local, regional, and patient-related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.","output":"Management of Lung Nodules and Lung Cancer Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic: CHEST Expert Panel Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the SARS CoV2 Coronavirus pandemic is believed to have originated in Wuhan in 2019 as a zoonotic spread from bats to humans. It is a highly communicable infection-causing rapid human to human transmission of the virus by virtue of its infectious and pleomorphic nature. The virus has affected millions of people worldwide, with numbers still rising with each passing day. Depleting oxygen saturation levels is amongst the prime concerns in the majority of infected patients. Nasal prongs, face masks, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) are the commonly used modes of oxygen delivery in such patients. These methods though mostly successful, at times fail to restore the depleting oxygen levels to normal. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves the administration of 100% O2 in a special chamber whose pressure is maintained at a level greater than 1 ATP. The main purpose for raising the pressure within the chamber is that as the atmospheric pressure increases, the saturation levels of oxygen in the blood also increase, which eventually result in increased overall tissue oxygenation. This article provides a systematic and wholesome review on the basic principle of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, its effects on the body at a microscopic and macroscopic level, its various uses and its suitability as an adjuvant for the treatment of select COVID-19 infected patients.","output":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy and its suitability as an adjuvant for treatment of covid-19 patients: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of H1N1 2009 influenza A, in a previously fit woman at 24 weeks of gestation, who presented atypically with abdominal pain.

We sought to assess if these modalities lead to increased aerosol dispersal compared to the use of non-humidified low-flow nasal cannula oxygen treatment (LFNC). METHODS: Aerosol dispersal from 20 healthy volunteers using HFNC, LFNC and NIV oxygen treatment was measured in a controlled chamber. We investigated effects related to coughing and using a surgical facemask in combination with the oxygen delivering modalities. An aerodynamic particle sizer measured aerosol particles (APS3321, 0.3C20 m) directly in front of the subjects, while a mesh of smaller particle sensors (SPS30, 0.3C10 m) was distributed in the test chamber. RESULTS: Non-productive coughing led to significant increases in particle dispersal close to the face when using LFNC and HFNC but not when using NIV. HFNC or NIV did not lead to a statistically significant increase in aerosol dispersal compared to LFNC. With non-productive cough in a room without air changes, there was a significant drop in particle levels between 100 cm and 180 cm from the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that using HFNC and NIV does not lead to increased aerosol dispersal compared to low-flow oxygen treatment, except in rare cases.

Recent studies have discussed the fact that the presence of T. gondii cysts in the brain and the resulting biochemical and immunological mechanisms could be linked to neurobehavioral disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential impact of chronic toxoplasmosis on sleepiness and on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity in OSA obese patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case control study on obese patients screened for OSA was performed. According to the sleep disorder and matched based on gender, age and body mass index (BMI), two groups of obese patients were selected from our sample collection database. All patients were tested for toxoplasmosis serological status measuring anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM levels. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to assess the impact of chronic toxoplasmosis on sleepiness and OSA severity. RESULTS: 107 obese patients suffering from OSA were included in the study (median age: 53.3 years Interquartile range (IQR): [41.9-59.9]; median BMI: 39.4 kg/m2 IQR: [35.5-44.1], apnea-hypopnea index = 27.5 events/h [10.7-49.9]). Chronic toxoplasmosis was present in 63.4% and 70.7% of patients with or without sleepiness (p = 0.48), respectively and was not associated either to sleepiness (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: [0.52; 2.33], p = 0.64) or OSA severity (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: [0.51; 5.98] p = 0.37).

We used data from 11 Arab countries (N = 2732), including Egypt (N = 831), and included measures for COVID-19 stressors (COVID-fear, economic, lockdown, and grief stressors), WTELS, resilience, religiosity, spirituality, social support, and PTG. We conducted ANOVA on the main sample to explore the differences between Arab countries, hierarchical regressions, and path analysis on the Egyptian subsample to test a model of the effects on WTELS. In the path model, WTELS was the independent variable. Other coping strategies were mediating variables, and COVID-19 stressor types were outcome variables. ANOVA on the main sample indicated that Egypt was the highest on COVID-19 stressors (infection fears, economic, lockdown, and grief stressors), actual infection, and WTELS. Hierarchical regression indicated that social support, resilience, and WTELS were positive predictors of PTG, with WTELS had the highest effect size ( = .41) and WTELS being a negative predictor of COVID-19 stressors, while resilience and social support were not. Path analysis indicated that WTELS predicted higher religiosity, spirituality, social support, resilience, and lower COVID-19 stressors. Religiosity predicted higher spirituality, social support, and resilience and lower COVID-19 stressors. Interfaith spirituality predicted higher resilience and lower COVID-19 grief stressors.

Those antibodies exert a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, whose evolution overtime after COVID-19 as well as efficiency against novel variants are however poorly characterized. METHODS: In this prospective study, sera of 107 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were collected at 3- and 6-months post-infection. We performed quantitative neutralization experiments on top of high-throughput serological assays evaluating anti-Spike (S) and anti-Nucleocapsid (NP) IgG. FINDINGS: Levels of sero-neutralization and IgG rates against the ancestral strain decreased significantly over time. After 6 months, 2.8% of the patients had a negative serological status for both anti-S and anti-NP IgG. However, all sera had a persistent and effective neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV-2. IgG levels correlated with sero-neutralization and this correlation was stronger for anti-S than for anti-NP antibodies. The level of sero-neutralization quantified at 6 months correlated with markers of initial severity, notably admission in intensive care units and the need for mechanical invasive ventilation. In addition, sera collected at 6 months were tested against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and showed efficient neutralizing effects against D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants but a significantly weaker activity against B.1.351 variant. INTERPRETATION: Decrease of IgG rates and serological assays becoming negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the ancestral strain and the D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants for at least 6 months in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19.

Its ability to recognize large panoply of viruses and virus-infected cells, and trigger the effector pathways, results in neutralization of viruses and killing of the infected cells.

These include targeting the recognition molecules for the avoidance of detection, targeting key enzymes and complexes of the complement pathways like C3 convertases and C5b-9 formation C either by encoding complement regulators or by recruiting membrane-bound and soluble host complement regulators, cleaving complement proteins by encoding protease, and inhibiting the synthesis of complement proteins. Additionally, viruses also exploit the complement system for their own benefit. For example, they use complement receptors as well as membrane regulators for cellular entry as well as their spread.

We report the very late (>1 year) thrombosis of PED constructs in 2 patients. RESULTS Two patients with very large fusiform basilar trunk aneurysms underwent parent artery reconstruction with the PED. Both patients were maintained on dual antiplatelet therapy throughout the first year following treatment. Follow-up conventional angiography, performed 12 months after treatment, demonstrated, in both patients, thrombosis of most of the aneurysm with minimal residual flow through the construct and into the aneurysm fundus. In response to the residual filling, clopidogrel was discontinued (aspirin therapy was maintained). Both patients presented with symptomatic acute occlusions of the PED constructs within 14 days of clopidogrel discontinuation. DISCUSSION Patient 1 presented with constitutional symptoms that progressed to severe headache without other neurologic signs or symptoms. Occlusion of the PED construct was confirmed with conventional angiography. MR imaging demonstrated no evidence of infarction or parenchymal injury. The headaches were managed successfully with steroid therapy. Patient 2 presented with a syndrome of acute basilar occlusion with brain stem stroke. Complete occlusion was confirmed on angiography. Emergent thrombolysis with mechanical revascularization was performed successfully; however, the patient ultimately succumbed to the infarction. CONCLUSIONS It appears that flow-diverting constructs built across large circumferential aneurysms may remain thrombogenic for much longer than conventional intracranial or peripheral bare metal stents. Constructs in these patients may remain susceptible to very late thrombosis, >1 year after implantation. These patients likely require long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (>1 year) to provide adequate prophylaxis against thrombosis. If these types of aneurysms demonstrate persistent residual filling months after PED reconstruction, operators should consider the placement of additional devices as an alternative to the discontinuation of 1 of the antiplatelet medications.","output":"Very late thrombosis of flow-diverting constructs after the treatment of large fusiform posterior circulation aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The critical period for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in China, in response to requirements for accelerating the modernization of the disease prevention and control system, we analyzed and summarized the current situation, existing problems, and deficiencies in China's modernization of disease prevention and control system.

The same procedure was performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments and both outcomes were compared. Methods Twenty-four animals were equally and randomly divided into a minilaparoscopic group (group A) and a 5-mm conventional laparoscopic group (group B). A high-definition NIR imaging system and a 30 ICG endoscope were used. First, ICG (0.5 mL) was injected in the paracervical region. The SLN coloring time was recorded. An extraperitoneal approach to the SLN was executed with the same CO2 retropneumoperitoneum pressures (10 mm Hg). In both groups, the times for SLN localization and excision, as well as complications, were registered. Finally, a laparotomy was then done to evaluate whether any stained SLN still remained. The same surgical team performed all experiments. Results SLNs were identified and extraperitoneally excised in all animals without major complications. The SLN localization varied between animals from external iliac to preaortic regions. The surgical times were shorter with minilaparoscopy (39.3  13 minutes) than with conventional 5-mm instruments (51.3  14.17 minutes; P = .042).

Access to surgical care was restored in a recovery phase but backlogs and societal shifts are hypothesized to impact surgical access. METHODS: Adults with electronic health record orders for procedures (\\"procedure requests\\"), from March 16 to August 25, 2019 and March 16 to August 25, 2020, were included. Logistic regression was performed for requested procedures that were not scheduled. Linear regression was performed for wait time from request to scheduled or completed procedure. RESULTS: The number of patients with procedure requests decreased 20.8%, from 26,789 in 2019 to 21,162 in 2020. Patients aged 36-50 and >65a??years, those speaking non-English languages, those with Medicare or no insurance, and those living >a??100 miles away had disproportionately larger decreases. Requested procedures had significantly increased adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of not being scheduled for patients with primary languages other than English, Spanish, or Cantonese (aOR 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.28); unpartnered marital status (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.37); uninsured or self-pay (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.53-2.70).

As part of the country's prevention-based health policy, substantial efforts have been made to control and prevent malaria transmission. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria and the associated factors in the community of Mizan-Aman and its catchment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September to October 2021, a community-based cross-sectional survey was undertaken among the communities of Mizan-Aman town and its catchment area in Southwest Ethiopia. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data, as well as a capillary blood sample from each study participant. Epi-data manager (v4.0.2.101) was used to enter the data and analyzed by SPSS version 25.0. A statistical significance was set at a P value of <0.05. RESULT: The study comprised a total of 412 people, of which 87 (21.1%) tested positive for malaria parasites, with a greater prevalence reported among those aged 25 to 34 years (5.8%). Individuals who lived near stagnant water were more likely to become infected with the malaria parasite (AOR = 8.996, 95% CI: 5.087-15.908) compared to those who lived further away, in warm climates, and those who did not use insecticide-treated bed nets were more susceptible to malaria parasite infection (AOR = 4.647, 95% CI: 1.257-17.184) compared to those who did use ITN and With (AOR = 0.466, 95% CI: 0.218-0.996 and AOR = 0.352, 95% CI: 0.206-0.604); participants with a history of antimalarial medication appear to have a protective function against malaria infection, respectively.

The challenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections are compounded by the geographic heterogeneity of the population. To address this problem, we propose to account for the differences between rural and urban settings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the pandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SEIR models. The setting of the model parameters takes into account the fact that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs mostly via human-to-human contact, and that the frequency of contact among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may change over time. Moreover, the probability that the virus spreads into an uninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from other communities where the infection is present. To account for these important aspects, each node of the network is characterized by the frequency of contact between its members and by its level of connectivity with other nodes. Census and cell phone data can be used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network, which can, in turn, be modified to account for different levels of mitigation measures. In order to make the network SEIR model that we propose easy to customize, it is formulated in terms of easily interpretable parameters that can be estimated from available community level data. The models parameters are estimated with Bayesian techniques using COVID-19 data for the states of Ohio and Michigan. The network model also gives rise to a geographically distributed computational model that explains the geographic dynamics of the contagion, e.g., in larger cities surrounded by suburban and rural areas.","output":"Metapopulation network models for understanding, predicting and managing the coronavirus disease COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have developed a reverse genetics system for the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in which a full-length cDNA corresponding to the IBV genome is inserted into the vaccinia virus genome under the control of a T7 promoter sequence.

This remote diagnosis offers patients the benefit of receiving advanced medical care without having to travel long distances. The provision of a remote diagnosis will provide elderly patients in rural areas with an earlier diagnosis without burdening patients in Japan where the aging population and the uneven distribution of doctors are increasing. However, the system will increase the burden on specialists by expanding the doctor's catchment area. As a solution to that problem, deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to reduce the burden on doctors. In order to realize 5G- and AI-based real-time diagnostic support, diagnostic imaging using AI and an AI model that provides instructions are required. This is because ultrasonography and endoscopy, which can be used for remote diagnosis, do not acquire data on fixed areas like a CT or MRI scan. The AI model needs to instruct the doctor at the patient's home in order to collect appropriate information in accordance with the patient's symptoms and status. In order to build an interactive AI model, the interactions between doctors who are making a remote diagnosis should be recorded as training data and a 5G-based remote diagnosis system should be created.

METHODS: Following the Model for Improvement QI methodology, a standardised process was developed for monitoring forced expiratory volume in 1 s with HS during multidisciplinary telemedicine visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. INTERVENTION: (1) HSs were distributed to eligible patients and (2) Home spirometry was monitored in eligible patients with each telemedicine visit and results were used for clinical care decisions. RESULTS: Both specific aims were achieved ahead of expected date. In March 2020, the beginning of the pandemic, 37% (49/131) of patients owned an HS and 50% (9/18) of patients seen via telemedicine performed spirometry at home.

Previous studies have shown a relationship between ABO blood groups and coronavirus. Some vaccination side effects, such as muscle pain at the injection site and fatigue, may impair an individual's ability to perform tasks that require fine motor skills, such as those performed by a general surgeon. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the association between ABO blood groups and the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines among general surgeons in Saudi Arabia. Method A cross-sectional online survey-based study regarding the side effects following COVID-19 vaccination was conducted among Saudi and non-Saudi general surgeons working in public and private hospitals in Saudi Arabia who had received one or two doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Results A total of 612 surgeons responded. Approximately, 74.7% of the respondents reported side effects after receiving vaccines. Tiredness was the most commonly reported side effect of the vaccine, followed by severe local pain at the site of injection. Approximately, 16.2% of the participants started showing side effects 12 hours after receiving the vaccine. There was a significant relationship between the type of vaccine administered and the appearance of side effects (p = 0.004). The rate of appearance of side effects was higher in participants who received the Pfizer vaccine. However, there was no significant relationship between the appearance of side effects and age, gender, blood group, number of doses, and past history of COVID-19 infection (p > 0.05). Of the total participants, 256 (41.8%) stated that the side effects of the vaccine affected their work performance. Moreover, there was no significant difference in side effects, symptoms appearing after vaccination, the onset of symptoms, and duration of symptoms between the participants who received one dose and those who received two doses of the vaccine. In addition, there was no significant relationship between the severity of side effects and age, past history of COVID-19 infection, number of doses, and blood type (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant relationship between the severity of side effects and gender and type of vaccine (p = 0.000 and 0.004, respectively). A high percentage of females and those who received the AstraZeneca vaccine stated that their side effects affected their work performance. Conclusion Three-quarters of the participants reported side effects after the COVID-19 vaccination, which affected the work performance of 41% of participating general surgeons. There was no significant relationship between the appearance of symptoms and age, gender, blood group, number of doses, and past history of COVID-19 infection. However, there was a significant relationship between the severity of side effects and gender and type of vaccination.

Although some reports have been found in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few reports have focused on the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). This study retrospectively investigated the relationship between the erector spinae muscle area measured from CT images and ADL at the time of hospital discharge in patients with COVID-19. Methods Among patients aged 40 years or older, 271 patients (median age, 65 years; 180/271 male patients) who had CT cross-sectional images of the 12th thoracic vertebral level on admission were included. The Katz index was used to assess ADLs, and patients who were not completely independent were defined as dependent. Multivariate logistic and Poisson regression analyses were applied to examine the relationship between the cross-sectional area of the erector spinae muscles and the onset of ADL dependence at discharge. Results A total of 75 (27.7%) patients became dependent on ADL at the time of hospital discharge. Decreased erector spinae muscle area was significantly related to dependent ADL at discharge (adjusted odds ratio: 0.886, 95% confidence interval: 0.805C0.975). In addition, the erector spinae muscle area was significantly related to the number of ADL items for which independence was not achieved (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.959, P < 0.001).

The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.","output":"The Rapid Development and Early Success of Covid 19 Vaccines Have Raised Hopes for Accelerating the Cancer Treatment Mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND While robotic-assisted colorectal surgery (RACS) is becoming increasingly popular, data comparing its outcomes to other established techniques remain limited to small case series. Moreover, there are no large studies evaluating the trends of RACS at the national level. METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2009-2010 was retrospectively reviewed for robotic-assisted and laparoscopic colorectal procedures performed for cancer, benign polyps, and diverticular disease. Trends in different settings, indications, and demographics were analyzed. Multivariate regression analysis was used to compare selected outcomes between RACS and conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS). RESULTS An estimated 128,288 colorectal procedures were performed through minimally invasive techniques over the study period, and RACS was used in 2.78 % of cases. From 2009 to 2010, the use of robotics increased in all hospital settings but was still more common in large, urban, and teaching hospitals. Rectal cancer was the most common indication for RACS, with a tendency toward its selective use in male patients. On multivariate analysis, robotic surgery was associated with higher hospital charges in colonic ($11,601.39; 95 % CI 6,921.82-16,280.97) and rectal cases ($12,964.90; 95 % CI 6,534.79-19,395.01), and higher rates of postoperative bleeding in colonic cases (OR = 2.15; 95 % CI 1.27- 3.65). RACS was similar to CLS with respect to length of hospital stay, morbidity, anastomotic leak, and ileus. Conversion to open surgery was significantly lower in robotic colonic and rectal procedures (0.41; 95 % CI 0.25-0.67) and (0.10; 95 % CI 0.06-0.16), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The use of RACS is still limited in the United States. However, its use increased over the study period despite higher associated charges and no real advantages over laparoscopy in terms of outcome. The one advantage is lower conversion rates.","output":"Robotic-assisted colorectal surgery in the United States: a nationwide analysis of trends and outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The analytical performance of the new Alere? i Influenza A&B kit (AL-Flu) assay, based on isothermal nucleic acids amplification, was evaluated and compared with an antigen detection method, SD Bioline Influenza Virus Antigen Test (SDB), and an automated real-time RT-PCR, Simplexa?

COVID-19, a highly infectious and severe disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a significant challenge for global public health. Cancer patients have been reported to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and have a higher risk for serious complications than the general population. However, the correlation between KIRC and COVID-19 remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the expression and prognostic significance of 333 SARS-CoV-2 infectionCrelated genes in KIRC using the TCGA dataset and identified 31 SARS-CoV-2Crelated differently expressed genes between KIRC and normal renal tissues. Based on these genes, we constructed and validated a 5-gene prognostic signature (including ACADM, CENPF, KDELC1, PLOD2, and TRMT1) to distinguish low- and high-risk KIRC patients of poor survival in TCGA and E-MTAB-1980 cohorts. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that some inflammatory/immune-related pathways were significantly enriched in the high-risk group. The ESTIMATE analysis indicated that patients in the high-risk group had higher stromal and immune cell scores, therefore lower tumor purity. Moreover, they presented higher proportions of macrophages M0, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and T follicular helper cells and higher expression of immune checkpoints CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIGIT, and PDCD1 than low-risk patients.

MHV infection in mice provides an efficient cause-effect experimental model to understand the mechanisms of direct virus induced neural cell damage leading to demyelination and axonal loss which are pathological features of Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common disabling neurological disease in young adults. Infiltration of T lymphocytes, activation of microglia and their interplay are the primary pathophysiological events leading to the disruption of myelin sheath in MS. However, there are emerging evidences supporting gray matter involvement and degeneration in MS. The investigation of T cell function in the pathogenesis of deep gray matter damage is necessary. Here, we employed RSA59 (isogenic recombinant strain of MHV-A59) induced experimental neuroinflammation model to compare the disease in CD4-/- mice with CD4+/+ mice at days 5, 10, 15, and 30 p.i. Viral titer estimation, nucleocapsid gene amplification and viral anti-nucleocapsid staining confirm enhanced replication of the virions in the absence of functional CD4+ T cells in the brain. Histopathological analyses showed an elevated susceptibility of CD4-/- mice to axonal degeneration in the CNS with augmented progression of acute poliomyelitis, and dorsal root ganglionic inflammation rarely observed in CD4+/+ mice. Depletion of CD4+ T cells shows unique pathological bulbar vacuolation in the brain parenchyma of infected mice with persistent CD11b+ microglia/macrophages in the inflamed regions on day 30 p.i. In summary, the current study suggests that CD4+ T cells are critical for controlling acute stage poliomyelitis (gray matter inflammation) and chronic axonal degeneration, inflammatory demyelination due to loss of protective anti-viral host immunity.IMPORTANCE The current trend in CNS disease biology is to understand the neural cell-immune interaction to investigate the underlying mechanism of neuroinflammation, rather than focusing on peripheral immune activation. Most studies in MS are targeted towards understanding the involvement of CNS white matter. However, the importance of gray matter damage has become critical in understanding the long-term progressive neurological disorder. Our study highlights the importance of CD4+T cells in safeguarding the neurons against axonal blebbing and poliomyelitis from murine Betacoronavirus-induced neuroinflammation. Current knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to gray matter damage in MS is limited, because the most widely used animal model EAE does not present this aspect of the disease. Our results thus, add to the existing limited knowledge in the field. We also show that the microglia, though important for the initiation of neuroinflammation, cannot establish a protective host immune response without the help of CD4+ T cells.","output":"CD4 deficiency causes poliomyelitis and axonal blebbing in murine coronavirus induced neuroinflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Many cancer survivors report issues with cognitive function following diagnosis and treatment.

This delay targeted admission to the most appropriate ward based on the medical condition. SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests and point of care (POC) rapid RT-PCR were introduced at emergency departments (EDs) in late 2020, but the consequence on targeted admission is unknown. Objectives To assess the effect of RAD tests and POC rapid RT-PCR (VitaPCR, Credo Diagnostics, Singapore) on targeted admission. Methods Patients presenting at the ED of a referral hospital (N = 2,940) between 13-Nov-2020 and 12-Jan-2021 were included. The study period was delimited by introduction of RAD tests and VitaPCR. Participant data was collected retrospectively, and outcome variables were length-of-stay (LoS), intrahospital transfers and targeted admission to COVID-19 ward. Results RAD tests reduced ED LoS for participants with positive tests or that were not tested. Negative VitaPCR results reduced mean hospital LoS by 1.5 (95%CI: 0.3-2.7) days and admissions to COVID--19 wards from 34.5 (95%CI: 28.9-40.5) to 14.7 (95%CI: 11.1-19.1) per 100 admissions. Introduction of VitaPCR reduced transfers between hospital wards in the first 5 days from 50.0 (95%CI: 45.0-55.0) to 34.0 (95%CI: 30.3-37.9) per 100 admissions. Conclusion RAD tests enabled rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection which had pronounced effects on LoS at the ED. VitaPCR added the possibility of exclusion of the infection which increased targeted admissions, reduced intrahospital transfers and lead to shorter stay at the hospital.","output":"A cohort study of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 point of care rapid RT-PCR at the Emergency Department on targeted admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The two studies reported in this paper aimed to present and discuss both the validation of the Work-Home Culture (WHC) scale (Dikkers et al., Work & Stress, 21(2), 155C172, 2007) in the Italian context (Study 1), and a relational model that links the WHC to subjective well-being via the mediation of three facets of the work-home interface: work-family conflict, work-family enrichment and work-family balance (Study 2).

In this work, using the porcine long bones, the 3-point bending tests were conducted to explore the bone fracture behaviors under the rigid impactor. The bone fracture dynamic process was recorded by high-speed photography and the fracture surface profile was observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Based on the CT scanning, their cross-section properties were calculated by a homemade MATLAB script for correlating with their strengths. Also, a subject-specific finite element (FE) model was developed to identify the influence on simulation. Findings led to conclusions as follows: 1) The tension fracture came with fracture path deflection, which was caused by the bone indentation induced mesoscale crack-opening. Due to this damage before the whole bone fracture, a bone fracture moment correction was defined to compensate experimental data. 2) The plastic indentation caused the impact force fluctuation. 3) The bone failure moment is higher correlated with the inertial moment of the bone cross-section than the traditional cross-section area. 4) In the subject-specific simulation, the indentation caused compression fracture and a much lower failure force.

In the current study, the gene designs for V and F1, two well-studied virulent factors serving as main targets for vaccine development, were altered to explore additional options in hopes of improving the protective immunity of DNA vaccines expressing these two antigens. Compared to the wild type V gene DNA vaccines, the use of codon optimized V gene sequences was effective in improving the antigen expression, titers of anti-V antibody responses, and survival against a mucosal lethal challenge. For the F1 DNA vaccine, removal of the N-terminal hydrophobic region was able to improve protective immunity. However, adding a mammalian signal peptide sequence to F1 actually led to reduced protection despite it inducing slightly higher anti-F1 antibody responses. The F1 gene can be fused with a gene coding for YscF, a newly confirmed partial protective antigen for Y. pestis, to produce DNA vaccines that express fused F1 and YscF antigens. One design, in particular, that had YscF fused to the downstream sequence of F1, produced better protection than separate F1 or YscF DNA vaccines, suggesting a potential synergistic effect between these two antigens. Findings from the above studies indicated that there are multiple approaches to optimize the protective immunity for plague DNA vaccines. Most importantly, proper antigen engineering to produce optimal antigen gene inserts in DNA vaccines can clearly play a major role in the future designs of a wide range of DNA vaccines.","output":"Antigen engineering can play a critical role in the protective immunity elicited by Yersinia pestis DNA vaccines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJETIVO: refletir sobre o processo de morrer e morte de pacientes com Covid-19  luz da espiritualidade.

An attractive alternative to the use of transgenics or pesticides in agriculture is the use of a 'green' alternative known as RNAi, which involves the delivery of siRNAs that downregulate endogenous genes to confer resistance. However, siRNA is a molecule that is highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation and is difficult to deliver across the lignin-rich and multi-layered plant cell wall that poses the dominant physical barrier to biomolecule delivery in plants. We have demonstrated that DNA nanostructures can be utilized as a cargo carrier for direct siRNA delivery and gene silencing in mature plants. The size, shape, compactness and stiffness of the DNA nanostructure affect both internalization into plant cells and subsequent gene silencing efficiency. Herein, we provide a detailed protocol that can be readily adopted with standard biology benchtop equipment to generate geometrically optimized DNA nanostructures for transgene-free and force-independent siRNA delivery and gene silencing in mature plants. We further discuss how such DNA nanostructures can be rationally designed to efficiently enter plant cells and deliver cargoes to mature plants, and provide guidance for DNA nanostructure characterization, storage and use.

The healthcare system, already overwhelmed in many countries, has been further burdened by the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The healthcare system has become inefficient, especially in the oncology care sector. Surgeries, scheduled treatments, and follow-up appointments in some hospitals have been canceled or rescheduled to the \\"next available date after the end of the pandemic\\". This research aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the availability of medical care among oncological patients and compare them with the results of studies on the effects of postponement of oncology treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study included a group of 544 respondents from all over Poland. The research tool was a self-administered survey questionnaire. RESULTS: Results: 37%, of those undergoing systemic treatment, experienced postponement of their treatment, and in the case of radiotherapy, it was 35%. Visits to the clinical oncologist/radiotherapist specialist were postponed in 51% of respondents. Imaging studies were delayed in 41.7% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The course of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the health care system and, therefore, also on the availability of medical care among oncologicalpatients. The results signal an emerging problem. These visit shifts may negatively affect the outcome of cancer treatment. The potential risk of COVID-19 infection should beindividually balanced against cancer treatment delay in each patient.

QAC already are commonly found in wastewaters, and their concentration could increase, since QAC are recommended to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Exposure of bacteria to QAC can lead to proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). In particular, O2-based membrane biofilm reactors (O2-MBfRs) achieved excellent CTAB biodegradation, but ARG increased in their biofilms. Here, we applied meta-transcriptomic analyses to assess the impacts of CTAB exposure and operating conditions on microbial community's composition and ARG expression in the O2-MBfRs. Two opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, dominated the microbial communities and were associated with the presence of ARG. Operating conditions that imposed stress on the biofilms, i.e., limited supplies of O2 and nitrogen or a high loading of CTAB, led to large increases in ARG expression, particularly for genes conferring antibiotic-target protection. Important within the efflux pumps was the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) family, which may have been active in exporting CTAB from cells. Oxidative stress appeared to be the key factor that triggered ARG proliferation by selecting intrinsically resistant species and accentuating the expression of ARG. Our findings suggest that means to mitigate the spread of ARG, such as shown here in a O2-based membrane biofilm reactor, need to consider the impacts of stressors, including QAC exposure and stressful operating conditions.","output":"Increased expression of antibiotic-resistance genes in biofilm communities upon exposure to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and other stress conditions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Futile resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients in the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 era can lead to risk of disease transmission and unnecessary transport. Various existing basic or advanced life support (BLS or ALS, respectively) rules for the termination of resuscitation (TOR) have been derived and validated in North America and Asian countries. This study aimed to evaluate the external validation of these rules in predicting the survival outcomes of OHCA patients in the COVID-19 era. Methods: This was a multicenter observational study using the WinCOVID-19 Daegu registry data collected during February 18CMarch 31, 2020. The subjects were patients who showed cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology. The outcomes of each rule were compared to the actual patient survival outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, false positive value (FPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of each TOR rule were evaluated. Results: In total, 170 of the 184 OHCA patients were eligible and evaluated. TOR was recommended for 122 patients based on the international basic life support termination of resuscitation (BLS-TOR) rule, which showed 85% specificity, 74% sensitivity, 0.8% FPV, and 99% PPV for predicting unfavorable survival outcomes. When the traditional BLS-TOR rules and KoCARC TOR rule II were applied to our registry, one patient met the TOR criteria but survived at hospital discharge. With regard to the FPV (upper limit of 95% confidence interval <5%), specificity (100%), and PPV (>99%) criteria, only the KoCARC TOR rule I, which included a combination of three factors including not being witnessed by emergency medical technicians, presenting with an asystole at the scene, and not experiencing prehospital shock delivery or return of spontaneous circulation, was found to be superior to all other TOR rules.

Treatment for symptomatic botulism is limited to supportive care and artificial ventilation until respiratory function spontaneously recovers, which can take weeks or longer. Mechanistic insights into intracellular toxin behavior have progressed significantly since it was shown that toxins exploit synaptic endocytosis for entry into the nerve terminal, but fundamental questions about host-toxin interactions remain unanswered. Chief among these are mechanisms by which BoNT is internalized into neurons and trafficked to sites of molecular toxicity. Elucidating how receptor-bound toxin is internalized and conditions under which the toxin light chain engages with target SNARE proteins is critical for understanding the dynamics of intoxication and identifying novel therapeutics.

Prior to this, our general surgical pathology (SP) and cytopathology (CP) services held daily consensus conferences (CC) at a multi-headed microscope. Implementing social distancing meant only a few faculty were present onsite and avoidance of interactions at the multi-headed scope. In an effort to preserve QA through CC, faculty exploited the use of web conferencing through our HIPAA-compliant Zoom. We describe the utility of this new practice. METHODS: From 3/25-4/30/20, all SP and CP cases selected for CC were presented by respective pathologists (n=8) in their own offices by using individual microscopes with cameras, image acquisition software, and screen-sharing through Zoom. One pathologist was responsible for sending out a new CC Zoom link daily and recording the consensus diagnosis. All onsite pathologists and those at home participated. RESULTS: We presented 95 SP and 31 CP cases through Zoom compared to 300 SP and 60 CP cases presented at a similar timeframe prior to social distancing. This 68% and 48% decline could be attributed to elective procedure cancellation. We assigned a consensus diagnosis to all cases, with 77% overall being malignant diagnoses, and breast being the most common SP specimen type (22%). Additionally, all participating pathologists felt comfortable with the new format irrespective of being onsite or at home. Apart from minor audio issues, we did not notice significant lag time or visual disturbances that interfered with diagnostic abilities. Importantly, the transition did not involve investing in new technology.

Despite decades of telemedicine in clinical practice, it is rare to find it used in small-metro and academic settings. Following the decision to limit face-to-face care, we tracked our practice's transition to telemedicine. METHODS This was a prospective quality improvement project following Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to optimize the use of telemedicine (both telephone and video in this practice) encounters. Central to the PDSA cycles was the use of a post-encounter questionnaire to track patient, appointment, and physician factors. Throughout the cycles, inferential statistics were used to inform process improvement. RESULTS In Cycle 2, a logistic regression model showed length of encounter, need for physical examination, and physician satisfaction correctly predicted a physician's preferred medium (2(3) = 40.56, P < .001). In Cycle 3, a 2 test showed the reason for visit predicted the preferred medium (2(4) = 47.30, P < .001). In cycle 4, week of telemedicine, need for physical examination, length of encounter and physician satisfaction predicted the preferred medium (2(9) = 172.52, P < .001). DISCUSSION Using the variables that predicted preference for telemedicine, we were able to adjust our processes through PDSA cycles. CONCLUSION Early use of the PDSA cycle allows for informed quality improvement at the local level. Our findings highlight factors to consider when implementing telemedicine such as need for physical examination and type or length of encounter. In addition, physician satisfaction can encourage use of telemedicine, and tools for learning and practicing telemedicine should be available.","output":"A Stepwise Transition to Telemedicine in Response to COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the middle of the nineteenth century, it became clear that micro-organisms could cause disease. Effective treatment, however, was not possible at that time; prevention and spread of infectious diseases depended solely on proper hygienic means. At the beginning of the twentieth century, passive and active vaccination procedures were developed against a number of these PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISMS to prevent the diseases in question (rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, etc.). Thanks to the discovery of antimicrobial chemicals (by Paul Ehrlich) and antibiotics (by Sir Alexander Fleming), the threat of infectious diseases seemed to be minimised. Large-scale vaccination programmes against childhood diseases (diphtheria, whooping cough, and polio), started in the early 1950s, raised hopes of finally being able to eradicate these diseases from the planet. This approach was successful for smallpox (1980). However, new infectious diseases have emerged [e.g., Legionella, HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV), Helicobacter, SARS, etc.], and new vaccines and antibiotics are needed. Furthermore, due to intensive medical treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs, hospital infections are a growing problem. Bacteria hitherto deemed harmless are causing OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS in immunocompromised patients.

These hamper their potential societal benefit and impairs the ability to quickly respond to emerging new pathogens. This is especially worrisome since new pathogens are emerging at all-time high rates of over one per year, and many age-old pathogens are still not vaccine preventable.Through interviews with 20 key-opinion-leaders (KOLs), this study identified innovation barriers that increase vaccine development timelines. These innovation barriers were visualized, and their underlying causes revealed by means of qualitative root cause analysis. Based on a survey the innovation barriers were quantitatively ranked based on their relative impact on both regular, and Covid-19 vaccine development timelines. KOLs identified 20 key innovation barriers, and mapping these barriers onto the Vaccine Innovation Cycle model revealed that all phases of vaccine development were affected. Affected by most barriers is the area between the preclinical studies and the market entry. Difficult hand-off between academia and industry, lack of funding, and lack of knowledge of pathogen targets were often mentioned as causes. Quantitative survey responses from 93 KOLs showed that general vaccine development and Covid-19 vaccine development are impacted by distinct sets of innovation barriers. For the general vaccine development three barriers were perceived of the highest impact; limited ROI for vaccines addressing disease with limited market size, limited ROI for vaccines compared to non-vaccine projects, and academia not being able to progress beyond proof of principle. Of highest impact on Covid-19 vaccine development, are lack of knowledge concerning pathogen target, high risk of upscaling unlicensed vaccines, and proof of principle not meeting late-stage requirements. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that barriers hampering timelines in vaccine development are present across the Vaccine Innovation Cycle. Prioritizing the impact of barriers in general, and in Covid-19 vaccine development, shows clear differences that can be used to inform policies to speed up development in both war and peace time.","output":"Barriers Influencing Vaccine Development Timelines, Identification, Causal Analysis, and Prioritization of Key Barriers by KOLs in General and Covid-19 Vaccine R&D"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The function of natural killer (NK) cells in inflammation has not been explored enough in large-scale population studies.

The time-dependent changes were analyzed in 1005 subjects with repeated measurement in 3C6 months. The changes in inflammatory markers were analyzed based on the changes in NKA. Results: As NKA reduces to a very low level, the white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts increase sharply, and the lymphocyte count exhibits a slow decline. With increasing NKA larger than about 500 pg/mL, WBC and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) reduces in a mild slope. Among the subjects with repeated measurements, the follow-up NKA was increased with advancing baseline NKA levels.

In this paper, a new graph-theory based alignment-free sequence comparison method is proposed. A complete-bipartite graph is used to represent each genome sequence based on its nucleotide triplets. Subsequently, with the help of the weights of edges of the graph, a vector descriptor is formed. Finally, the phylogenetic tree is drawn using the UPGMA algorithm.

While anticoagulation has historically been the foundation for treatment of PE, this review highlights the recent rapid expansion in the interventional strategies for this condition. RECENT FINDINGS: At the time of diagnosis, appropriate risk stratification helps to accurately identify patients who may be candidates for advanced therapeutic interventions. While systemic thrombolytics (ST) is the mostly commonly utilized intervention for high-risk PE, the risk profile of ST for intermediate-risk PE limits its use. Assessment of an individualized patient risk profile, often via a multidisciplinary pulmonary response team (PERT) model, there are various interventional strategies to consider for PE management. Novel therapeutic options include catheter-directed thrombolysis, catheter-based embolectomy, or mechanical circulatory support for certain high-risk PE patients. Current data has established safety and efficacy for catheter-based treatment of PE based on surrogate outcome measures. However, there is limited long-term data or prospective comparisons between treatment modalities and ST. While PE diagnosis has improved with modern cross-sectional imaging, there is interest in improved diagnostic models for PE that incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.

We described outcomes overall and by subgroups (age  or >80 years; onset-to-groin puncture  or >6 hours; anterior or posterior strokes; previous IV recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator or isolated endovascular treatment/therapy; revascularization or no revascularization), and determined independent predictors of good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 2) and mortality at 3 months by multivariate modeling. RESULTS We analyzed 536 patients, of whom 285 received previous IV recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. Overall, revascularization (modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction scores, 2b and 3) occurred in 73.9%, 5.6% developed symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages, 43.3% achieved good functional outcome, and 22.2% were dead at 90 days.

Thus, from the analysis of the traffic volumes made on some of the main access highways to the MRSP, as well as the monitoring of the levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), directly linked to atmospheric emissions from motor vehiclesCwhich make up about 95% of air polluting agents in the region in different locationsCwe showed relationships between the improvement in air quality and the decrease in vehicles that access the MRSP. To improve the data analysis, therefore, the isolation index parameter was evaluated to provide daily information on the percentage of citizens in each municipality of the state that was effectively practicing social distancing. The intersection of these groups of data determined that the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the volume of vehicles on the highways by up to 50% of what it was in 2019, with the subsequent recovery of the traffic volume, even surpassing the values from the baseline year. Thus, the isolation index showed a decline of up to 20% between its implementation in March 2020 and December 2020.

However, it may result in both financial, mental, and social costs. Given these tradeoffs, it is unclear when and who needs to social distance over the course of a pandemic when policies are allowed to change dynamically over time and vary across different risk groups (e.g., older versus younger individuals face different Covid-19 risks). In this study, we examine the optimal time to implement social distancing to optimize social utility, using Covid-19 as an example. MethodologyWe propose using a Markov decision process (MDP) model that incorporates transmission dynamics of an age-stratified SEIR compartmental model to identify the optimal social distancing policy for each risk group over time. We parameterize the model using population-based tracking data on Covid-19 within the US. We compare results of two cases: allowing the social distancing policy to vary only over time, or over both time and population (by risk group). To examine the robustness of our results, we perform sensitivity analysis on patient costs, transmission rates, clearance rates, mortality rates. ResultsOur model framework can be used to effectively evaluate dynamic policies while disease transmission and progression occurs. When the policy cannot vary by subpopulation, the optimal policy is to implement social distancing for a limited duration at the beginning of the epidemic; when the policy can vary by subpopulation, our results suggest that some subgroups (older adults) may never need to socially distance. This result may occur because older adults occupy a relatively small proportion of the total population and have less contact with others even without social distancing. ConclusionOur results show that the additional flexibility of allowing social distancing policies to vary over time and across the population can generate substantial utility gain even when only two patient risk groups are considered. MDP frameworks may help generate helpful insights for policymakers. Our results suggest that social distancing for high-contact but low-risk individuals (e.g., such as younger adults) may be more beneficial in some settings than doing so for low-contact but high-risk individuals (e.g., older adults).","output":"Optimizing Social Distancing Policies: A Dynamic Programming Approach for Coupled High and Low Risk Populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An accurate diagnosis is essential to identify and manage SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and implement infection control measures. Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current recommended laboratory method, several rapid antigen point-of-care tests (POCTs) were developed as frontline testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess a recently CE-approved POCT, SARS-CoV-2 Ag Test on the LumiraDx? Platform (LumiraDx GmbH, Cologne, Germany) for the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected subjects at hospital setting. METHODS: LumiraDx POCT was implemented in three hospital settings: adult and pediatric emergency departments and occupational medicine department along two-month period during the second peak of Italian SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Rapid antigen testing was performed on direct nasal swabs and results were compared with those obtained by Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were 90.3%, 92.1%, 95.1%, and 84.9%, respectively, compared to reference method. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for symptomatic group were 89.3% [95% IC 84.2-93.3], 88.2% [95% IC 72.5-96.7], 97.8% [95% IC 94.6-99.1], and 58.8% [95% IC 48.4-68.5], respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for asymptomatic group were 92.1% [95% IC 85-96.5], 92.3% [95% IC 89.9-94.4], 67.9% [95% IC 61.3-73.8], and 98.5% [95% IC 97.1-99.2], respectively. False positive and negative antigen testing results in both symptomatic and asymptomatic group were observed. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 Ag POCT may represent an interesting tool to rapidly identify symptomatic or asymptomatic infected subjects. However, in hospital setting in which false negative or false positive results may have relevant implications, confirmatory NAAT always remains necessary for the appropriate management of patients.","output":"Evaluation of an antigen-based test for hospital point-of-care diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A female nurse in her 40s caring for a patient with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pneumonia treated with a high\\\\flow nasal cannula (HFNC) presented with fever, cough and dyspnoea.

Publications about child abuse had been discussed in academia for long years and evaluated by bibliometric analysis, frequently. This study aims to evaluate the most discussed/disseminated scientific publications about child abuse in electronic media such as social media accounts, blogs, podcasts, and media news sites using a new analysis method called altmetric analysis. Methods: The data were obtained from the Altmetric Explorer database using the phrase child abuse, in 2021. After being ranked by altmetric attention score (AAS), descriptive statistics for all publications as well as detailed analyses for the first-100 publications were performed. Variables evaluated were AAS, dimensions-badge value, distribution of web sources, demographic/geographic-breakdown type distributions, main subject categories, and mesh terms. Kruskal Wallis test was used for AAS and dimensions-badge value comparisons while Spearman correlations and regression analysis were also performed. Analyses were performed by SPSS 23.0 (IBM SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Publications about child abuse were shared extensively on social media, mostly on Twitter. In terms of the main subject, sexual abuse was the trending topic, followed by physical abuse and maltreatment. Psychology, studies in human society, health sciences, and law/legal issues were the four main science categories about the subject. The United States was the major disseminator of publications while Child Abuse and Neglect was the most productive journal. There was a weak but significant (p<0.05) positive correlation between AAS and dimensions-badge values. Conclusion: Child abuse is a multidimensional subject in social media. As the number of publications increases, the possibility of articles to be shared on different social media platforms also increases.

METHODS We enrolled a consecutive cohort of recently diagnosed (<18 months) PD patients with unilateral manifestations using age and gender-matched controls. The most affected body region was determined using various clinical standard metrics and objective quantitative kinematic measurements. Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative data were used for external validation of the results. RESULTS Twenty-five drug-naive patients and 21 controls were studied. Upper limbs were (92%) the most affected body region at onset as ascertained by patients' self-assessment, neurologists' impression, and Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score. The upper limb (ie, hand) was the site of onset in 80% of patients. Motor features progressed to involve the lower limb but remained limited to the initially affected body side over a 2-year follow-up. Agreement among the different metrics (96%) confirmed focal upper limb predominant motor impairment at onset. The findings were confirmed by quantitative kinematic analyses and from a cohort of 34 similar patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. CONCLUSIONS Motor manifestations in PD start distally in one upper limb. The complexity of the motor repertoire and, consequently, the presumed larger dopaminergic striatal demand for maintaining skillful motor function in the upper limb, may contribute to greater vulnerability of dopaminergic striatal terminals. Recognition of this motor pattern could be used to monitor the evolution of nigrostriatal degeneration and the putative impact of therapies. ? 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","output":"Motor Onset Topography and Progression in Parkinson's Disease: the Upper Limb Is First."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Photonic crystal (PC)-based inverse opal (IO) arrays are one of the substrates for label-free sensing mechanism.

Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) is at the crossroad of the processes allowing SARS-CoV-2 to multiply, because CTP is in demand for four essential metabolic steps. It is a building block of the virus genome, it is required for synthesis of the cytosine-based liponucleotide precursors of the viral envelope, it is a critical building block of the host transfer RNAs synthesis and it is required for synthesis of dolichol-phosphate, a precursor of viral protein glycosylation. The CCA 3'-end of all the transfer RNAs required to translate the RNA genome and further transcripts into the proteins used to build active virus copies is not coded in the human genome. It must be synthesized de novo from CTP and ATP. Furthermore, intermediary metabolism is built on compulsory steps of synthesis and salvage of cytosine-based metabolites via uridine triphosphate that keep limiting CTP availability. As a consequence, accidental replication errors tend to replace cytosine by uracil in the genome, unless recombination events allow the sequence to return to its ancestral sequences. We document some of the consequences of this situation in the function of viral proteins. This unique metabolic setup allowed us to highlight and provide a raison d'tre to viperin, an enzyme of innate antiviral immunity, which synthesizes 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP as an extremely efficient antiviral nucleotide.","output":"A Path toward SARS-CoV-2 Attenuation: Metabolic Pressure on CTP Synthesis Rules the Virus Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children spend most of their indoors time at home, which may have substantial influence on their health.

However, they may encounter difficulties adapting their practices to the pandemic. We provide here an analysis of guidelines for the reorganisation of GP surgeries during the beginning of the pandemic from 15 countries. METHODS: A network of GPs collaborated together in a three-step process: (i) identification of key recommendations of GP surgery reorganisation, according to WHO, CDC and health professional resources from health care facilities; (ii) collection of key recommendations included in the guidelines published in 15 countries; (iii) analysis, comparison and synthesis of the results. RESULTS: Recommendations for the reorganisation of GP surgeries of four types were identified: (i) reorganisation of GP consultations (cancelation of non-urgent consultations, follow-up via e-consultations), (ii) reorganisation of GP surgeries (area partitioning, visual alerts and signs, strict hygiene measures), (iii) reorganisation of medical examinations by GPs (equipment, hygiene, partial clinical examinations, patient education), (iv) reorganisation of GP staff (equipment, management, meetings, collaboration with the local community). CONCLUSIONS: We provide here an analysis of guidelines for the reorganisation of GP surgeries during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak from 15 countries. These guidelines focus principally on clinical care, with less attention paid to staff management, and the area of epidemiological surveillance and research is largely neglected.

Patients and Methods: Radiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches. Results: Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease. Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. Delays in consultations and return visits was deemed safe based on stage of disease between 1-6 months. Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease. Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary. Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease.

We sought to determine whether KL-6 was a marker of 1) the severity of acute COVID-19 infection, or 2) the persistence of symptoms/radiological abnormalities at medium term follow up. METHODS: Prospective single centre observational study. RESULTS: Convalescent KL-6 levels were available for 93 patients (male 63%, mean age 55.8 years) who attended an 12-week follow up appointment after being admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For 67 patients a baseline KL-6 result was available for comparison. There was no significant correlations between baseline KL-6 and the admission CXR severity score or clinical severity NEWS score. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the baseline KL-6 level and an initial requirement for oxygen on admission or the severity of acute infection as measured at 28 days. There was no significant difference in the 12-week KL-6 level and the presence or absence of subjective breathlessness but patients with abnormal CT scans at 12 weeks had significantly higher convalescent KL-6 levels compared to the remainder of the cohort (median 1101 IU/ml vs 409 IU/ml).

This paper investigates disparities in county-level mortality rates across counties with higher and lower than national average Black population shares using nonlinear regression decomposition and estimates potential differential impact of social distancing measures. I find counties with Black population shares above the national share have mortality rates 2 to 3 times higher than in other counties. Observable differences in living conditions, health, and work characteristics reduce the disparity to approximately 1.25 to 1.65 overall, and explain 100% of the disparity at 21 days after the first case. Though higher rates of comorbidities in counties with higher Black population shares are an important predictor, living situation factors like single parenthood and population density are just as important. Higher rates of co-residence with grandchildren explain 11% of the 21 day disparity but do not appear important by 42 days, suggesting families may have been better able to protect vulnerable family members later in the epidemic. To analyze differential effects of social distancing measures use two approaches. First, I exploit the timing of interventions relative to the first case among counties that began their epidemic at the same time. Second, I use event study analysis to analyze within-county changes in mortality. Findings for social distancing measures are not always consistent across approaches. Overall, I find no evidence that school closures were less effective in counties with larger Black population shares, and some estimates suggest closures may have disproportionately helped more diverse counties and counties with high rates of grandparent and grandchild co-residence. Conversely, stay at home orders are less clearly associated with mortality in any counties, reaching peak unemployment did not reduce mortality in any models, and some estimates indicate reaching peak unemployment before the first case was associated with higher mortality rates, especially in more diverse counties.","output":"Disparities in COVID-19 mortality by county racial composition and the role of spring social distancing measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pain is common in women with HIV, though little research has focused on psychosocial experiences contributing to pain in this population.

Methods are needed to systematically bridge this crucial gap to facilitate experimental testing of hypotheses and translation to clinical utility. RESULTS: Here, we leveraged cross-phenotype associations to identify traits with shared genetic architecture, using linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to accurately capture shared SNPs by proxy, and calculate significance of enrichment. This shared genetic architecture was examined across differing biological scales through incorporating data from catalogs of clinical, cellular, and molecular GWAS. We have created an interactive web database (interactive Cross-Phenotype Analysis of GWAS database (iCPAGdb)) to facilitate exploration and allow rapid analysis of user-uploaded GWAS summary statistics. This database revealed well-known relationships among phenotypes, as well as the generation of novel hypotheses to explain the pathophysiology of common diseases. Application of iCPAGdb to a recent GWAS of severe COVID-19 demonstrated unexpected overlap of GWAS signals between COVID-19 and human diseases, including with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis driven by the DPP9 locus. Transcriptomics from peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that DPP9 was induced in SARS-CoV-2 compared to healthy controls or those with bacterial infection. Further investigation of cross-phenotype SNPs associated with both severe COVID-19 and other human traits demonstrated colocalization of the GWAS signal at the ABO locus with plasma protein levels of a reported receptor of SARS-CoV-2, CD209 (DC-SIGN). This finding points to a possible mechanism whereby glycosylation of CD209 by ABO may regulate COVID-19 disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, connecting genetically related traits across phenotypic scales links human diseases to molecular and cellular measurements that can reveal mechanisms and lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

Simplistically, it can be divided into a fast, impulsive, reward system 1 and a slow, deliberate, control system 2. In a noisy eating environment, our cognitive resources may get depleted, potentially leading to cognitive overload, emotional arousal, and consequently more rash decisions, such as unhealthy food choices. Here, we investigated the combined impact of cognitive regulation and ambient noise on food cravings through neurophysiological activity. Thirty-seven participants were recruited for an adapted version of the Regulation of Craving (ROC) task. All participants underwent two sessions of the ROC task; once with soft ambient restaurant noise (50 dB) and once with loud ambient restaurant noise (70 dB), while data from electroencephalography (EEG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and self-reported craving were collected for all palatable food images presented in the task. The results indicated that thinking about future (later) consequences vs. immediate (now) sensations associated with the food decreased cravings, which were mediated by frontal EEG alpha power. Likewise, later trials also increased frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) an index for emotional motivation. Furthermore, loud (vs. soft) noise increased alpha, beta, and theta activity, but for theta activity, this was solely occurring during later trials. Similarly, EDA signal peak probability was also higher during loud noise. Collectively, our findings suggest that the presence of loud ambient noise in conjunction with prospective thinking can lead to the highest emotional arousal and cognitive load as measured by EDA and EEG, respectively, both of which are important in regulating cravings and decisions. Thus, exploring the combined effects of interoceptive regulation and exteroceptive cues on food-related decision-making could be methodologically advantageous in consumer neuroscience and entail theoretical, commercial, and managerial implications.","output":"Sound Decisions: The Combined Role of Ambient Noise and Cognitive Regulation on the Neurophysiology of Food Cravings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: : Tracheostomy is an important surgical procedure for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients who underwent prolonged tracheal intubation. Surgical indication of tracheostomy is greatly affected by the general condition of the patient, comorbidity, prognosis, hospital resources, and staff experience. Thus, the optimal timing of tracheostomy remains controversial. METHODS: : We reviewed our early experience with COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at one tertiary hospital in Japan from February to September 2020and analyzed the timing of tracheostomy, operative results, and occupational infection in healthcare workers (HCWs). RESULTS: : Of 16 patients received tracheal intubation with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, five patients (31%) received surgical tracheostomy in our hospital. The average consultation time for surgical tracheostomy was 7.4 days (range, 6 - 9 days) from the COVID-19 team to the otolaryngologist. The duration from tracheal intubation to tracheostomy ranged from 14 to 27 days (average, 20 days). The average time of tracheostomy was 27 min (range, 17 - 39 min), and post-wound bleeding occurred in only one patient. No significant differences in hemoglobin (Hb) levels were found between the pre- and postoperative periods (mean: 10.2 vs. 10.2 g/dl, p = 0.93). Similarly, no difference was found in white blood cell (WBC) count (mean: 12,200 vs. 9,900 cells /l, p = 0.25). After the tracheostomy, there was no occupational infection among the HCWs who assisted the tracheostomy patients during the perioperative period. CONCLUSION: : We proposed a modified weaning protocol and surgical indications of tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients and recommend that an optimal timing for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients of 2 - 3 weeks after tracheal intubation, from our early experiences in Japan. An experienced multi-disciplinary tracheostomy team is essential to perform a safe tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and to minimize the risk of occupational infection in HCWs.","output":"Surgical Strategy and Optimal Timing of Tracheostomy in Patients with COVID-19: Early Experiences in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) and internet can have a promising role in maximizing safety and preventing the rapid terrifying spread of COVID-19. With the exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, there is a high possibility that the physicians and health care workers will not be able to cover all of these cases. Thus, computer scientists should contribute in this struggle against COVID-19 by introducing more intelligent solutions to achieve a rapid control of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to provide analysis for the current literature along with discussing the possible applicability for the available ideas that utilize AI to prevent and control COVID-19 showing how the current systems may be of use in a particular area to build a comprehensive view. This can be of great help to many healthcare administrators, computer scientists, and policy makers around the world. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of articles that utilize MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Embase and Web of Knowledge databases to formulate a comprehensive view that summarize different ideas about the most recent approaches to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 using AI. RESULTS: Our search identified the 10 most recent artificial intelligence approaches, which were suggested to be able to give the best solutions for maximizing safety and preventing the spread of COVID-19. The approaches included detection of suspected cases, large scale screening, monitoring, interactions with experimental therapies, screening pneumonia, internet of intelligent things for data and information, resources allocation, predictions, modeling and simulation, and robotics for medical quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that the most approaches which almost have none or very few studies are the usage of AI for COVID-19 interactions with experimental therapies, usage of AI for resources allocation to COVID-19 patients, and usage of AI and internet of intelligent things for COVID-19 data and information. However, other approaches including usage of AI for COVID-19 predictions, usage of AI for COVID-19 modeling and simulation, and usage of AI robotics for medical quarantine should be furtherly emphasized to be adopted by researchers since these important approaches lack sufficient number of studies. Therefore, our recommendation for computer scientists is to focus on these approaches that are still not being adequately covered.","output":"Can Artificial Intelligence and Internet be the Solution to Prevent the Exponential Spread of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have repeatedly restricted public life to control the contagion. However, the health impact of confinement measures is hitherto unclear. We performed a multinational survey investigating changes in mental and physical well-being (MWB/PWB) during the first wave of the pandemic. A total of 14,975 individuals from 14 countries provided valid responses. Compared to pre-restrictions, MWB, as measured by the WHO-5 questionnaire, decreased considerably during restrictions (68.1  16.9 to 51.9  21.0 points). Whereas 14.2% of the participants met the cutoff for depression screening pre-restrictions, this share tripled to 45.2% during restrictions. Factors associated with clinically relevant decreases in MWB were female sex (odds ratio/OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.11C1.29), high physical activity levels pre-restrictions (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.16C1.42), decreased vigorous physical activity during restrictions (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05C1.23), and working (partially) outside the home vs. working remotely (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16C1.44/OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.23C1.47). Reductions, although smaller, were also seen for PWB. Scores in the SF-36 bodily pain subscale decreased from 85.8  18.7% pre-restrictions to 81.3  21.9% during restrictions.

However, traditional and novel antiviral discovery approaches are unable to mitigate them in a timely manner. Notably, drug repurposing emerged as an alternative strategy to provide antiviral solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. In the literature, many FDA-approved drugs have been repurposed to inhibit viruses, while a few among them have also entered clinical trials. Using experimental data, we identified repurposed drugs against 14 viruses responsible for causing epidemics and pandemics such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza H1N1, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, chikungunya, and others. We developed a novel computational drug-target-drug approach that uses the drug targets extracted for specific drugs, which are experimentally validated in vitro or in vivo for antiviral activity. Furthermore, these extracted drug targets were used to fetch the novel FDA-approved drugs for each virus and prioritize them by calculating their confidence scores. Pathway analysis showed that the majority of the extracted targets are involved in cancer and signaling pathways. For SARS-CoV-2, our method identified 21 potential repurposed drugs, of which 7 (e.g., baricitinib, ramipril, chlorpromazine, enalaprilat, etc.) have already entered clinical trials. The prioritized drug candidates were further validated using a molecular docking approach. Therefore, we anticipate success during the experimental validation of our predicted FDA-approved repurposed drugs against 14 viruses.

The literature has assessed and evaluated its role in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, no data are available regarding its role in COVID-19 critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the use of low-dose aspirin (81-100 mg) and its impact on outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHOD: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study of all critically ill adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) between March 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021. Eligible patients were classified into two groups based on aspirin use during ICU stay. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and other outcomes were considered secondary. Propensity score matching was used (1:1 ratio) based on the selected criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1033 patients were eligible, and 352 patients were included after propensity score matching. The in-hospital mortality (HR 0.73 [0.56, 0.97], p = 0.03) was lower in patients who received aspirin during stay. Conversely, patients who received aspirin had a higher odds of major bleeding than those in the control group (OR 2.92 [0.91, 9.36], p = 0.07); however, this was not statistically significant. Additionally, subgroup analysis showed a possible mortality benefit for patients who used aspirin therapy prior to hospitalization and continued during ICU stay (HR 0.72 [0.52, 1.01], p = 0.05), but not with the new initiation of aspirin (HR 1.22 [0.68, 2.20], p = 0.50). CONCLUSION: Continuation of aspirin therapy during ICU stay in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were receiving it prior to ICU admission may have a mortality benefit; nevertheless, it may be associated with an increased risk of significant bleeding.

A change in external factors, such as pandemics, has challenged politicians and governments at large to be responsive in resolving problems quickly. Generally, recent research focused on reactive policies, disaster mitigation, and medical issues, while discussing government responsiveness in disease prevention is only covered in a few studies. This research uses a comparative qualitative method with an analysis period from December 2019 to the end of May 2020. The data is derived from various secondary information sources, such as research results, news, official reports, or government statements, which are interpreted through a systematic coding process to explain the phenomenon. The primary results showed that government responsiveness determines the success of handling the deadly Coronavirus in pre-pandemic and current pandemic situations. A strong political will and leadership style is essential, and a solid bureaucratic apparatus in implementing policies and programs is decisive. As an authoritarian democracy, in collaboration with CDC, Vietnam was able to anticipate before the pandemic spread and succeeded in suppressing the spread after it was detected even though it had issued a blundering policy. Meanwhile, as a democratic country, Indonesia slowly responded to the outbreak by decision making where the pandemic is handled after it is detected and spread to various regions.

Because widespread uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is critical to end the pandemic, addressing vaccine hesitancy is an important public health priority. Between April 1, 2020 and March 16, 2021, we have repeatedly surveyed a nationally representative online panel of adults and have tracked their stated likelihood of getting COVID-19 vaccinations. We present new evidence that in recent months disparities in self-reported likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination have narrowed by race/ethnicity, with an increasing proportion of Black individuals and Hispanic individuals indicating that they are likely to get a vaccine. At the same time, younger adults have progressively become less likely than older adults to state they will get a COVID-19 vaccine. Most vaccine-hesitant individuals are concerned about both vaccine efficacy and safety and do not trust the vaccine development or vaccine approval process. We conclude that outreach efforts to minority populations may be achieving their objectives in raising confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, but special outreach efforts are needed to address both vaccine hesitancy among younger adults and mistrust in the vaccine development and approval process.","output":"Likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination by subgroups across the US: post-election trends and disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During times of stress, supportive communication can buffer individuals from experiencing negative outcomes. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially altered the interactions people rely on for support, which may influence the supportive messages they desire and receive. When people receive quantities of support that differ from what they desire, they experience support gaps, which are often associated with negative outcomes. The present study examines: (a) support gaps in close relationships under shelter-in-place orders issued in response to the pandemic;(b) how support gaps may be moderated by recipient and provider sex;and (c) relationships between support gaps and loneliness, stress, and relational satisfaction. Data were collected in Spring 2020 from community members across the United States and students at a large Midwestern university (N = 273). Participants reported on five types of support desired and received from their closest relational partner. Unexpectedly, participants generally reported receiving more support than desired, though this finding was qualified by their biological sex and the biological sex of their partner. As expected, support deficits were primarily associated with negative outcomes. Surplus esteem support was positively associated with relational satisfaction and negatively associated with perceived stress. Results are discussed in terms of theoretical implications for support gaps research and theory as well as pragmatic implications for individuals experiencing a global, shared stressor.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar to each other in many respects, such as structure, genetics, and pathobiology. We hypothesized that coronaviruses could affect pulmonary tissues via integration with the critical immune genes after their interaction with reninCangiotensin system (RAS) elements. The aim of the present bioinformatics study was to assess expression changes of the RAS and non-RAS genes, particularly immune response genes, in the lung epithelial cells after infection with SARS-CoV. METHODS: Linear regression, hierarchical clustering, pathway analysis, and network analysis were performed using the E-GEOD-17400 data set. RESULTS: The whole-genome expression data of the lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV for 12, 24, and 48 hours were analyzed, and a total of 15 RAS family and 29 immune genes were found to be highly correlated with the exposure time to the virus in the studied groups. CONCLUSION: RAS genes are important at the initiation of the infections caused by coronavirus family members and may have a strong relationship with the exchange of immune genes in due course following the infection.","output":"In vitro analysis of the reninCangiotensin system and inflammatory gene transcripts in human bronchial epithelial cells after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Cardiac miR-132 activation leads to adverse remodelling and pathological hypertrophy.

The aim of the current study was to assess safety and efficacy of CDR132L in a clinically relevant large animal (pig) model of chronic heart failure following MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a chronic model of post-MI HF, slow-growing pigs underwent 90 min left anterior descending artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Animals were randomized and treatment started 1-month post-MI. Monthly intravenous (IV) treatments of CDR132L over 3 or 5 months (3 or 5) were applied in a blinded randomized placebo-controlled fashion. Efficacy was evaluated based on serial magnetic resonance imaging, haemodynamic, and biomarker analyses. The treatment regime provided sufficient tissue exposure and CDR132L was well tolerated. Overall, CDR132L treatment significantly improved cardiac function and reversed cardiac remodelling. In addition to the systolic recovery, diastolic function was also ameliorated in this chronic model of HF. CONCLUSION: Monthly repeated dosing of CDR132L is safe and adequate to provide clinically relevant exposure and therapeutic efficacy in a model of chronic post-MI HF.

Although protective measures have been taken, the impact of the pandemic on key workers is yet to be fully elucidated. METHODS: Participants were from four longitudinal age-homogeneous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970 and 1958). A web-based survey provided outcome data during the first UK national lockdown (May 2020) on COVID-19 infection status, changes in financial situation, trust in government, conflict with people around, household composition, psychological distress, alcohol consumption, smoking and sleep duration. Generalised linear models with logit link assessed the association between being a key worker and the above outcomes. Adjustment was made for cohort design, non-response, sex, ethnicity, adult socioeconomic position (SEP), childhood SEP, the presence of a chronic illness and receipt of a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts. FINDINGS: 13 736 participants were included. During lockdown, being a key worker was associated with increased chances of being infected with COVID-19 (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.68) and experiencing conflict with people around (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37). However, key workers were less likely to be worse off financially (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.65), to consume more alcohol (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98) or to smoke more (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.80) during lockdown. Interestingly, being a key worker was not associated with psychological distress (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05). INTERPRETATION: Being a key worker during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown was a double-edged sword, with both benefits and downsides. The UK government had the basic duty to protect its key workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it may have failed to do so, and there is an urgent need to rectify this in light of the ongoing third wave.","output":"Impact of lockdown on key workers: findings from the COVID-19 survey in four UK national longitudinal studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plan aims to end the HIV epidemic in the United States by 2030. Having timely and accessible data to assess progress toward EHE goals at the local level is a critical resource to achieve this goal. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to introduce Americas HIV Epidemic Analysis Dashboard (AHEAD), a data visualization tool that displays relevant data on the 6 HIV indicators provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. AHEAD can be used to monitor progress toward ending the HIV epidemic in local communities across the United States. Its objective is to make data available to stakeholders, which can be used to measure national and local progress toward 2025 and 2030 EHE goals and to help jurisdictions make local decisions that are grounded in high-quality data. METHODS: AHEAD displays data from public health data systems (eg, surveillance systems and census data), organized around the 6 EHE indicators (HIV incidence, knowledge of HIV status, HIV diagnoses, linkage to HIV medical care, viral HIV suppression, and preexposure prophylaxis coverage). Data are displayed for each of the EHE priority areas (48 counties in Washington, District of Columbia, and San Juan, Puerto Rico) which accounted for more than 50% of all US HIV diagnoses in 2016 and 2017 and 7 primarily southern states with high rates of HIV in rural communities. AHEAD also displays data for the 43 remaining states for which data are available. Data features prioritize interactive data visualization tools that allow users to compare indicator data stratified by sex at birth, race or ethnicity, age, and transmission category within a jurisdiction (when available) or compare data on EHE indicators between jurisdictions. RESULTS: AHEAD was launched on August 14, 2020. In the 11 months since its launch, the Dashboard has been visited 26,591 times by 17,600 unique users. About one-quarter of all users returned to the Dashboard at least once. On average, users engaged with 2.4 pages during their visit to the Dashboard, indicating that the average user goes beyond the informational landing page to engage with 1 or more pages of data and content. The most frequently visited content pages are the jurisdiction webpages. CONCLUSIONS: The Ending the HIV Epidemic plan is described as a whole of society effort. Societal public health initiatives require objective indicators and require that all societal stakeholders have transparent access to indicator data at the level of the health jurisdictions responsible for meeting the goals of the plan. Data transparency empowers local stakeholders to track movement toward EHE goals, identify areas with needs for improvement, and make data-informed adjustments to deploy the expertise and resources required to locally tailor and implement strategies to end the HIV epidemic in their jurisdiction.","output":"Americas HIV Epidemic Analysis Dashboard: Protocol for a Data Resource to Support Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: There is sparse data on the role of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from India. Herein, we report our experience with the use of NIV in mild to moderate ARDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study involving consecutive subjects of ARDS treated with NIV using an oronasal mask. Patients were monitored clinically with serial arterial blood gas analysis. The success of NIV, duration of NIV use, Intensive Care Unit stay, hospital mortality, and improvement in clinical and blood gas parameters were assessed. The success of NIV was defined as prevention of endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: A total of 41 subjects (27 women, mean age: 30.9 years) were included in the study. Tropical infections followed by abdominal sepsis were the most common causes of ARDS. The use of NIV was successful in 18 (44%) subjects, while 23 subjects required intubation. The median time to intubation was 3 h. Overall, 19 (46.3%) deaths were encountered, all in those requiring invasive ventilation. The mean duration of ventilation was significantly higher in the intubated patients (7.1 vs. 2.6 days, P = 0.004). Univariate analysis revealed a lack of improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) at 1 h and high baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) as predictors of NIV failure. CONCLUSIONS: Use of NIV in mild to moderate ARDS helped in avoiding intubation in about 44% of the subjects. A baseline APACHE II score of >17 and a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio <150 at 1 h predicts NIV failure.","output":"A study on the role of noninvasive ventilation in mild-to-moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public school shootings in the U.S. have increased over the past few decades.

In addition, researchers have argued that intuition favors prosocial behavior while deliberation leads to selfish behavior.

Our sample consists of 496 participants, and we used a 4 (COVID-19 scenario: Control vs. Impact Uncertainty vs. Worst-Case vs. Indirect Transmission) by 2 (decision time: time delay vs. time pressure) between-subjects design. Results suggest that participants are more inclined to stay at home (prosocial intention) when forced to make their decisions intuitively rather than deliberately. Additionally, we found that uncertainty does not always decrease prosocial behavior. It seems that uncertainty does not affect the prosocial intention in a scenario with a real infectious disease. These findings suggest that the distinction between outcome and impact uncertainty may be due to the realism of experimental stimuli interventions.","output":"A dual-process approach to prosocial behavior under COVID-19 uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remain a public health problem.

The basic reproduction number, R0 is derived using the Next Generation Matrix method, while the importance of the position of patients within the meta-population model is assessed via stochastic simulation. The single-staff model had an R0 of 0.337, while the other two models had R0s of 0.278. The meta-population model's R0 was not sensitive to the time nurses spent with their assigned patients vs. unassigned patients.

The aim of this study is to describe the dynamics in applied COVID-19 pharmacotherapy during the first 100 days of the pandemic and to assess how the national advisory document influenced local hospital policies. METHODS: A multicentre observational cohort study was conducted in six hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted between 27 February and 7 June 2020 were studied. Drug prescription data were collected and percentages of patients receiving a specific treatment were calculated. These percentages were plotted together with release dates of the national advisory document. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with hospital pharmacists and infectious diseases specialists were conducted to gain insight into the development and implementation of pharmacotherapy treatment protocols in hospitals. RESULTS: Data from 1511 patients (60% men, mean age 66 years) were analysed. From mid-March (hydroxy)chloroquine was being prescribed in all six hospitals to approximately 70% of patients at admission. Frequencies of other off-label treatments were below 2%. In the week of 6 April 2020, the first hospital discontinued prescribing (hydroxy)chloroquine and the last hospital discontinued in the week of 4 May 2020 (total range ?19 to +10 days after the national advisory document advised against its use (1 May 2020)). All interviewees (n=6) stated that the hospitals based their policies mainly on the national advisory document but also assessed scientific literature themselves. Order panels were constructed to support prescribing. CONCLUSION: Dutch hospitals opted en masse for (hydroxy)chloroquine as COVID-19 therapy at the start of the pandemic, although the time until the therapy was no longer prescribed differed by several weeks. The fact that hospitals defined pharmacotherapy regimens based on their own assessment of the scientific literature besides the national advisory document can explain this variation.","output":"The dynamics in applied COVID-19 pharmacotherapy and the influence of national guidance in The Netherlands: a quantitative and qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The home advantage (HA) affects football competitions, especially due to the presence of crowd support. Even though several studies demonstrated that HA (which is influenced by the crowd) decreased in recent years, the empty stadia caused by COVID-19 restrictions offered unique situations to explore and quantify HA. For this reason, we aimed to assess HA in two seasons of the major Italian Championships. We conducted an observational study with the data from the last three seasons of the Italian football championship ACB series, analyzing a total of 2.964 individual game scores. To quantify the HA, the number of points won at home was calculated as a percentage of the total number of points won, home and away. In every season and for every team classification, HA was found (scored points > 50% in home matches). We reported a difference in HA median score for Serie B. Additionally, a difference was found in Serie A for middle-ranking HA median scores in the two seasons compared (p-value = 0.017), which was similarly found in Serie B (p-value = 0.009). The number of penalties was lower in the season with a crowd compared to one without a crowd (p = 0.001). The HA did not disappear in empty stadiums, so there must be other contributing factors. Additionally, we found that the referees were biased by the presence of the crowd in favor of the home teams, and this result could be considered by the football association during referees training and formation.","output":"The Role of Crowd Support on Home Advantage during COVID-19 Restrictions on Italian Football Competitions.

RESEARCH QUESTION: How does in-hospital mortality compare with intermediate- versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, and separately with in-hospital aspirin versus no antiplatelet therapy, in treatment of COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from 2785 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients, we established two separate, nested cohorts of patients (1) who received intermediate- or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation (anticoagulation cohort, N = 1624), or (2) who were not on home antiplatelet therapy and received either in-hospital aspirin or no antiplatelet therapy (aspirin cohort, N = 1956). Propensity score matching utilizing various markers of illness severity and other patient-specific covariates yielded treatment groups with well-balanced covariates in each cohort. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of in-hospital death. RESULTS: Among propensity score-matched patients in the anticoagulation cohort (N = 382), in a multivariable regression model, intermediate- compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.518 [0.308C0.872]). Among propensity-score matched patients in the aspirin cohort (N = 638), in a multivariable regression model, in-hospital aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.522 [0.336C0.812]).

These investigations are then evaluated from a variety of angles, including motivation, functionality, engineering approach, and methodology. Engineering efforts were directed at a combination of market-based solutions, middlewares, toolkits, algorithms, semantic frameworks, and conceptual frameworks, according to the study, which noted disparities in the studies implementations. For further understanding, the different independent parameters influencing the CASB are studied using PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The outcome of their analysis was the identification of five parameters influencing the PCA analysis. The experimental results were used as input for Research Surface Methodology (RSM) to obtain an empirical model. For this, five-level coding was employed for developing the model and considered three dependent parameters and four center values. For more understanding of these independent variables' influence, on the CASB study, RSM analysis was employed. It was observed from the CCD (Central Composite Design) model that the actual values show significant influence with R(2) = 0.90. This wide investigation reveals that CASB is still in a formative state. Even though vital advancement has been carried out in this zone, obvious challenges stay to be tended to, which have been highlighted in this paper.","output":"RSM analysis based cloud access security broker: a systematic literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The First Step Act, a seemingly miraculous bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, was signed into law in late 2018. The Act directed the Attorney General to develop a risk and needs assessment tool that would effectively determine who would be eligible for early release based on an algorithmic prediction of recidivism. The resulting toolPATTERNwas released in the summer of 2019 and quickly updated in January of 2020. It was immediately put to use in an unexpected manner, helping to determine who was eligible for early release during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now the latest in a growing list of algorithmic recidivism prediction tools, tools that first came to mainstream notice with critical reporting about the COMPAS sentencing algorithm.This Article evaluates PATTERN, both in its development as well as its still-evolving implementation. In some ways, the PATTERN algorithm represents tentative steps in the right direction on issues like transparency, public input, and use of dynamic factors. But PATTERN, like many algorithmic decision-making tools, will have a disproportionate impact on Black inmates;it provides fewer opportunities for inmates to reduce their risk score than it claims and is still shrouded in some secrecy due to the governments decision to dismiss repeated calls to release more information about it. Perhaps most perplexing, it is unclear whether the tool actually advances accuracy with its predictions. This Article concludes that PATTERN is a decent first step, but it still has a long way to go before it is truly reformative.","output":"Reprogramming Recidivism: The First Step Act and Algorithmic Prediction of Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, the World Health Organisation declared that pneumonia of unknown aetiology broke out in China and then expanded to become a pandemic Vietnam was predicted to be one of the hardest-hit countries of this pandemic However, this country has written its own exceptional story with a low and contained infection rate and few deaths on its territory This study seeks to highlight the global significance of the Vietnamese response model in the fight against COVID-19 The study suggests that the Vietnamese Governments procedures, from central officials to grassroots cadre, have significance on three levels with comparative importance First, attention is given to the use of tracking mechanisms enabled by medical surveillance and record systems Then, the role of social media in educational epidemiology Finally, we highlight the adjustment of Vietnamese social practices, behaviours, and cultural habituation, which were crucial in fighting the pandemic These results of this study suggest an effective, low-cost model in combating pandemic which could be applied by other countries, despite a surprising, but sadly recurrent, the reluctance of international media to represent Vietnam fairly and impartially The paper draws attention to the importance of Vietnams experience in tracking systems, health, and education, aiming to illustrate effective measures that have global significance and suggest opportunities for international implementation [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Social Identities is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Coronavirus pandemic in Vietnam: an effective response model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mortality threats are among the strongest psychological threats that an individual can encounter.

Finding alternative teaching methods may improve students motivation and understanding of this field. METHODS: We developed the Neurospeed, a game to learn neurological syndromes. We assessed its efficiency on short-term learning of neurological syndromes in third-year medical students, through Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) before and after the game session. Students satisfaction was evaluated by a satisfaction survey. RESULTS: Out of the 199 third-year medical students of the Faculty of Medicine Sorbonne Paris Nord, 180 attended the Neurospeed in December 2020, and 148 answered 20 Multiple Choice Questions before and after the game, with significant improvement of their score (p < 0.001). Most of the participants agreed that the game was playful, stimulating, and helpful to learn neurological semiology. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results show that the Neurospeed game is an interesting tool as a complement to traditional lectures. Further studies are necessary to compare the efficacy of different types of serious games on short-term and long-term learning of neurological semiology.

TRIAL DESIGN: Open-label, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness platform trial with response-adaptive randomization PARTICIPANTS: We will evaluate patients who meet the eligibility criteria stipulated by the COVID-19 mAB EUAs who receive mABs within the UPMC Health System, including infusion centers and emergency departments. EUA eligibility criteria include patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, <10 days of symptoms, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization (elderly, obese, and/or with specific comorbidities). The EUA criteria exclude patients who require oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19 and patients already hospitalized for the treatment of COVID-19. We will use data collected for routine clinical care, including data entered into the electronic medical record and from follow-up calls. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The interventions are the COVID-19 specific mABs authorized by the EUAs. All aspects of mAB treatment, including eligibility criteria, dosing, and post-infusion monitoring, are as per the EUAs. As a comparative effectiveness trial, all patients receive mAB treatment, and the interventions are compared against each other. When U.S. government mAB policies change (e.g., FDA grants or revokes EUAs), UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mAB interventions will accordingly change. From November 2020 to February 2021, FDA issued EUAs for three mAB treatments (bamlanivimab; bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab), and at trial launch on March 10, 2021 we evaluated all three. Due to a sustained increase in SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States resistant to bamlanivimab administered alone, on March 24, 2021 the U.S. Government halted distribution of bamlanivimab alone, and UPMC accordingly halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. On April 16, 2021, FDA revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab monotherapy. At the time of manuscript submission, we are therefore evaluating the two mAB treatments authorized by EUAs (bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is total hospital free days (HFD) at 28 days after mAB administration, calculated as 28 minus the number of days during the index stay (if applicable - e.g., for patients admitted to hospital after mAB administration in the emergency department) minus the number of days readmitted during the 28 days after treatment. This composite endpoint captures the number of days from the day of mAB administration to the 28 days thereafter, during which the patient is alive and free of hospitalization. Death within 28 days is recorded as -1 HFD, as the worst outcome. RANDOMISATION: We will start with equal allocation. Due to uncertainty in sample size, we will use a Bayesian adaptive design and response adaptive randomization to ensure ability to provide statistical inference despite variable sample size. When mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order, the order is filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange. OPTIMISE-C19 provides the therapeutic interchange via random allocation. Infusion center operations teams and pharmacists use a mAB assignment application embedded in the electronic medical record to determine the random allocation. BLINDING (MASKING): This trial is open-label. However, outcome assessors conducting follow-up calls at day 28 are blinded to mAB assignment, and investigators are blinded to by-mAB aggregate outcome data until a statistical platform trial conclusion is reached. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Sample size will be determined by case volume throughout the course of the pandemic, supply of FDA authorized mABs, and by that needed to reach a platform trial conclusion of inferiority, superiority, or futility of a given mAB. The trial will continue as long as more than one mAB type is available under EUA, and their comparative effectiveness is uncertain. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol Version 1.0, February 24, 2021. Recruitment began March 10, 2021 and is ongoing at the time of manuscript submission. The estimated recruitment end date is February 22, 2022, though the final end date is dependent on how the pandemic evolves, mAB availability, and when final platform trial conclusions are reached. As noted above, due to U.S. Government decisions, UPMC Health System halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04790786 .

The biological drivers of AMR are well understood, but factors related to treatment seeking and the social contexts of antibiotic (AB) use behaviours are less understood. Here we describe the Holistic Approach to Unravel Antibacterial Resistance in East Africa, a multicentre consortium that investigates the diverse drivers of drug resistance in urinary tract infections (UTIs) in East Africa. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will take place in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. We will conduct geospatial mapping of AB sellers, and conduct mystery client studies and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with drug sellers to investigate AB provision practices. In parallel, we will conduct IDIs with doctors, alongside community focus groups. Clinically diagnosed patients with UTI will be recruited from healthcare centres, provide urine samples and complete a questionnaire capturing retrospective treatment pathways, sociodemographic characteristics, attitudes and knowledge. Bacterial isolates from urine and stool samples will be subject to culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing. Genomic DNA from bacterial isolates will be extracted with a subset being sequenced. A follow-up household interview will be conducted with 1800 UTI-positive patients, where further environmental samples will be collected. A subsample of patients will be interviewed using qualitative tools. Questionnaire data, microbiological analysis and qualitative data will be linked at the individual level. Quantitative data will be analysed using statistical modelling, including Bayesian network analysis, and all forms of qualitative data analysed through iterative thematic content analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approvals have been obtained from all national and local ethical review bodies in East Africa and the UK. Results will be disseminated in communities, with local and global policy stakeholders, and in academic circles. They will have great potential to inform policy, improve clinical practice and build regional pathogen surveillance capacity.","output":"Protocol for an interdisciplinary cross-sectional study investigating the social, biological and community-level drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR): Holistic Approach to Unravel Antibacterial Resistance in East Africa (HATUA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of pleural effusions is a common occurrence in patients with neoplastic disease.

The programme monitors those with an aneurysm, and early intervention for large aneurysms reduces ruptures and AAA-related mortality. AAA screening services have been disrupted following COVID-19 but it is not known how this may impact AAA-related mortality, or where efforts should be focussed as services resume. METHODS: We repurposed a previously validated discrete event simulation model to investigate the impact of COVID-19-related service disruption on key outcomes. This model was used to explore the impact of delayed invitation and reduced attendance in men invited to screening. Additionally, we investigated the impact of temporarily suspending scans, increasing the threshold for elective surgery to 7cm and increasing drop-out in the AAA cohort under surveillance, using data from NAAASP to inform the population. FINDINGS: Delaying invitation to primary screening up to two years had little impact on key outcomes whereas a 10% reduction in attendance could lead to a 2% lifetime increase in AAA-related deaths. In surveillance patients, a 1-year suspension of surveillance or increase in the elective threshold resulted in a 0.4% increase in excess AAA-related deaths (8% in those 5-5.4cm at the start). Longer suspensions or a doubling of drop-out from surveillance would have a pronounced impact on outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Efforts should be directed towards encouraging men to attend AAA screening service appointments post-COVID-19. Those with AAAs on surveillance should be prioritised as the screening programme resumes, as changes to these services beyond one year are likely to have a larger impact on surgical burden and AAA-related mortality.","output":"Modelling the impact of changes to abdominal aortic aneurysm screening and treatment services in England during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: After the first COVID-19 infection wave, a constant increase of pulmonary embolism (PE) hospitalizations not linked with active PCR-confirmed COVID-19 was observed, but potential contributors to this observation are unclear. Therefore, we analyzed associations between changes in PE hospitalizations and (1) the incidence of non-COVID-19 pneumonia, (2) the use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), (3) volume depletion, and (4) preceding COVID-19 infection numbers in Germany. Methods: Claims data of Helios hospitals in Germany were used, and consecutive cases with a hospital admission between May 6 and December 15, 2020 (PE surplus period), were analyzed and compared to corresponding periods covering the same weeks in 2016C2019 (control period). We analyzed the number of PE cases in the target period with multivariable Poisson general linear mixed models (GLMM) including (a) cohorts of 2020 versus 2016C2019, (b) the number of cases with pneumonia, (c) CTPA, and (d) volume depletion and adjusted for age and sex. In order to associate the daily number of PE cases in 2020 with the number of preceding SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany, we calculated the average number of daily infections (divided by 10,000) occurring between 14 up to 90 days with increasing window sizes before PE cases and modeled the data with Poisson regression. Results: There were 2,404 PE hospitalizations between May 6 and December 15, 2020, as opposed to 2,112C2,236 (total 8,717) in the corresponding 2016C2019 control periods (crude rate ratio [CRR] 1.10, 95% CI 1.05C1.15, P < 0.01). With the use of multivariable Poisson GLMM adjusted for age, sex, and volume depletion, PE cases were significantly associated with the number of cases with pneumonia (CRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07C1.10, P < 0.01) and with CTPA (CRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.09C1.10, P < 0.01). The increase of PE cases in 2020 compared with the control period remained significant (CRR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02C1.12, P < 0.01) when controlling for those factors. In the 2020 cohort, the number of preceding average daily COVID-19 infections was associated with increased PE case incidence in all investigated windows, i.e., including preceding infections from 14 to 90 days. The best model (log likelihood ?576) was with a window size of 4 days, i.e., average COVID-19 infections 14C17 days before PE hospitalization had a risk of 1.20 (95% CI 1.12C1.29, P < 0.01). Conclusions: There is an increase in PE cases since early May 2020 compared to corresponding periods in 2016C2019. This surplus was significant even when controlling for changes in potential modulators such as demographics, volume depletion, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, CTPA use, and preceding COVID-19 infections.

Although the RBD peptide subunit is easily manufactured and highly stable, RBD-based subunit vaccines have been hampered by its poor inherent immunogenicity. We hypothesize that this limitation can be overcome by sustained co-administration alongside a potent and optimized adjuvant. The innate immune second messenger, cGAMP, holds promise as it activates the potent anti-viral STING pathway, but has exhibited poor performance as a therapeutic due to its nonspecific pharmacodynamic profiles when administered systemically and its poor pharmacokinetics arising from rapid excretion and degradation by its hydrolase ENPP1. To overcome these limitations, we sought to mimic the natural scenario of viral infections by creating an artificial immunological niche that enables slow release of cGAMP and the RBD antigen. Specifically, we co-encapsulated cGAMP and RBD in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel system. This cGAMP-adjuvanted hydrogel vaccine elicited more potent, durable, and broad antibody responses and improved neutralization than both dose-matched bolus controls and a hydrogel-based vaccine lacking cGAMP.

Aim of this study was to analyze coping strategies and resilience in people living with HIV (PLWH) compared to people living with oncological diseases (PLWOD) during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this observational study based on the administration of an anonymous questionnaire, we explored the emotional experience, the clinical and demographic factors linked to a COVID-19-related stress syndrome, the patients perception about the adequacy of clinical and psychological undertaking from the hospital and the level of resilience through a validated resilience scale. We performed a Kruskal-Wallis and a chi-squared test to compare the characteristics between PLWH and PLWOD and a linear regression to assess the factors associated to higher resilience. Results: We analyzed 324 questionnaires (PLWH n=167, PLWOD n=157). There were no significant differences in prevalence of psychological distress, anxiety, and fear among the whole cohort;however, PLWOD were calmer ( p =0.039), less troubled ( p =0.014), and more serene ( p =0.026) than PLWH. Moreover, PLWH smoked more ( p <0.001), ate more ( p =0.003) and thus gained more weight ( p =0.013) than PLWOD. 62% of patients didnt have more feelings of solitude than usual ( p =0.130) and 71,3% continued to take pleasure from their activities ( p =0.511). No differences in resilience were found between the groups, however in the whole cohort lower levels of resilience were found in patients that were unemployed (-3.52;95% CI = [-6.68 -0.35];p =0.029), with history of psychological disorders (-2.18;95% CI = [-3.17 -1.18];p <0.001) and in those who experienced more feelings of anger (-1.76;95% CI = [-2.67 -0.85];p <0.001), anxiety and concern (-1.56;95% CI = [-2.30 -0.82];p <0.001). Conclusions: PLWCD had high level of resilience, preserved in general their psychological well-being, and activated adaptive coping during the pandemic. However, PLWH showed higher distress than PLWOD according to comparable resilience score.

The cumulative mortality was 21% (3/14) in patients receiving CP transfusion during a 28-day observation, whereas one dead case (1/10) was reported in the control group. No significant difference was detected between groups in 28-day mortality (P = 0.615) and radiological alleviation of lung lesions (P = 0.085). CONCLUSION: In our current study, CP transfusion was clinically safe based on the safety profile; however, the clinical benefit was not significant in critically ill patients with more comorbidities at the late stage of disease during a 28-day observation.

During the first wave of the epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, hospitals have come under significant pressure. This scenario of uncertainty, low scientific evidence, and insufficient resources, has generated significant variability in practice between different health organisations. In this context, it is proposed to develop a standards-based model for the evaluation of the preparedness and response system against COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital. Materials and methods. The study, carried out at the University Hospital of Vall d'Hebron in Barcelona (Spain), was designed in two phases: 1) development of the standards-based model, by means of a narrative review of the literature, analysis of plans and protocols implemented in the hospital, a review process by expert professionals from the centre, and plan of action, and 2) validation of usability and usefulness of the model through self-assessment and hospital audit. Results. The model contains 208 standards distributed into 9 criteria: leadership and strategy; prevention and infection control; management of professionals and skills; public areas; healthcare areas; areas of support for diagnosis and treatment; logistics, technology and works; communication and patient care; and information and research systems. The evaluation achieved 85.2% compliance, with 42 areas for improvement and 96 good practices identified. Conclusions. Implementing a standards-based model is a useful tool to identify areas for improvement and good practices in COVID-19 preparedness and response plans in a hospital. In the current context, it is recommended to repeat this methodology in other non-hospital and public health settings.","output":"Modelo de evaluacin del plan de respuesta frente a la pandemia de COVID-19 en un hospital de tercer nivel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, governments have been implementing containment measures aimed at mitigating the spread of the virus, including restrictions to human mobility The ability to adapt to the pandemic and respond to containment measures can be bound by socioeconomic conditions, which are heterogeneous in large urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries In this paper, we analyse mobility changes following the implementation of containment measures in Bogot, Colombia We characterise the mobility network before and during the pandemic and analyse its evolution and changes between January and July 2020 We observe a general reduction in mobility trends, but the overall connectivity between different areas of the city remains after the lockdown, reflecting the resilience of the mobility network Then, we estimate a gravity model to assess the effect of socioeconomic conditions on mobility flows We find that the responses to lockdown policies depend on the socioeconomic conditions of the population Before the pandemic, the population with better socioeconomic conditions shows higher mobility flows Since the lockdown, mobility presents a general decrease, but the population with worse socioeconomic conditions shows lower reductions in mobility flows We conclude by deriving policy implications","output":"Changes in mobility and socioeconomic conditions during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A unified treatment of the renewable portfolio standards is given concerning direct methanol fuel.

Policy realignment under the five-year plan is discussed in length to demonstrate how policy, markets, and engineering designs contribute towards the development of model direct methanol fuel cells operational enhancement, and factors that affect critical performance parameters for commercial exploitation are summarized for catalytic formulations and cell design within the context of why this investment in technology, education, and finances is required within the global context of sustainable energy and energy independence as exposed by thirteenth the five-year plan. The prolog focuses on the way, whereas the section on methanol fuel cells on the how and the post log on what is expected post-COVID-19 era in science and technology as China pivots to a post-fossil fuel economy. China's industrial growth has been through internal market reforms and supplies side economics from the Chinese markets for fossil fuels except for petroleum. The latest renewable portfolio standards adopted have common elements as adopted from North American and the United Kingdom in terms of adaptation of obligation in terms of renewable portfolio standards as well as a realization that the necessity for renewables standards for the thirteen five year plan (from 2016 to 2020) need to less rigorously implemented due to performance targets that were met during the eleventh (06-10) and twelfth five-year plans (11-15) in terms of utilization of small coal-ire power plants, development of newer standards, led to an improvement of energy efficiency of 15 %, reduction of SOx/NOx by an average of 90 % and PM2.5 by 96 % over the last two five-year plans. The current phase of the plan has a focus on energy generation from coal and a slowing down of renewables or Renewable energy curtailment of approximately 400 T Wh renewables including 300 T Wh of non-hydro power, principally from Guangdong, and Jiangsu for transfer of hydropower and Zhejiang, Tianjin, Henan for non-hydro power transfer with Beijing and Shanghai playing important roles in renewables energy curtailment and realignment using an integrated approach to optimize each provinces energy portfolio. The realignment of the renewable energy portfolio indicates that the newly installed capacity in Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Zhejiang will account for less than 20 % of the current renewable energy portfolio but with the NOx SOx and PM2.5 savings already accrued. The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol (70 / 110 million metric tons from all sources in 2019 for China/world) is one technological approach to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions and suggests that catalytic methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation may be a plausible approach, even if it is more expensive economically than methanol synthesis by the syngas approach. This is because the CO2 emissions of the synthesis are lower than other synthesis methodologies. The Chinese government has placed a premium on cleaner air and water and may view such an approach as solving the dual issues of fuel substitution and reduction of CO2. Thus, the coupling of hydrogen generation from sustainable energies sources (Solar 175 / 509 GW) or wind (211/591.5 GW in 2019) may be an attractive approach, as this requires slightly less water than coal gasification. Due to the thermodynamic requirement of lower operating pressure and higher operating pressure, currently, there is no single operational approach, although some practice approaches (220 C at 48 atm using copper) and zinc oxide/alumina are suggested for optimal performance.","output":"Electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells to demonstrate China's renewable energy renewable portfolio standards within the framework of the 13th five-year plan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The prothrombotic phenotype and diffuse intravascular coagulation observed in COVID-19 reflect endothelial dysfunction, which is linked to blood flow delivery deficiencies and cardiovascular risk Assessments of detect vascular deficiencies among newly diagnosed and hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 have yet to be determined Objective To assess endothelial function characteristics in relation to length of hospitalization and mortality in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and compare to patients without COVID-19 Methods A prospective observational study involving 180 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 group) or suspected and ruled out COVID-19 (Non-COVID-19 group) Clinical evaluation and flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) were performed between the first 24-48 hours of hospitalization Patients were followed until death or discharge Results We evaluated 98 patients (COVID-19 group) and 82 (Non-COVID-19 group), COVID-19 group remained hospitalized longer and more deaths occurred compared to the Non-COVID-19 group (p = 0 01;and p&lt;0 01) Patients in COVID-19 group also had a significantly greater reduction in both FMDmm and FMD% (p&lt;0 01 in both) We found that absolute FMD&lt;0 26mm and relative FMD&lt;3 43% were the ideal cutoff point to predict mortality and longer hospital stay In Kaplan Meyer's analysis patients had a high probability of death within a period of up to 10 days of hospitalization Conclusion Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 present endothelial vascular dysfunction early, remained hospitalized longer and had a higher number of deaths, when compared with patients without COVID-19","output":"The endothelial function Provides early prognostic Information in patients with COVID-19: A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to compare two methods of preoperative planning for placement of intraocular implants: traditional paper documentation/electronic scans versus a novel online planning software.

METHODS: In adult consecutive patients admitted (March 1-April 15, 2020) to the ED of a major referral centre for COVID-19, we retrospectively calculated NEWS, NEWS2, NEWS-C, MEWS, qSOFA, and REMS from physiological variables measured on arrival. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of each EWS for predicting admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death at 48 h and 7 days were calculated. RESULTS: We included 334 patients (119 [35.6%] females, median age 66 [54-78] years). At 7 days, the rates of ICU admission and death were 56/334 (17%) and 26/334 (7.8%), respectively. NEWS was the most accurate predictor of ICU admission within 7 days (AUROC 0.783 [95% CI, 0.735-0.826]; sensitivity 71.4 [57.8-82.7]%; NPV 93.1 [89.8-95.3]%), while REMS was the most accurate predictor of death within 7 days (AUROC 0.823 [0.778C0.863]; sensitivity 96.1 [80.4-99.9]%; NPV 99.4[96.2C99.9]%). Similar results were observed for ICU admission and death at 48 h. NEWS and REMS were as accurate as the triage system used in our ED. MEWS and qSOFA had the lowest overall accuracy for both outcomes. CONCLUSION: In our single-centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, NEWS and REMS measured on ED arrival were the most sensitive predictors of 7-day ICU admission or death.

Patients and methods: a total of 230 patients (177 males and 53 females) aged 16C25, diagnosed with PD and NSSI behavior manifestations, were studied retrospectively in mental hospital and outpatintly by using clinical-psychopathological method. All patients were divided into two equal groups of 115 people each. Group I was examined in 2017C2019, Group II  in 2020C2021 during the coronavirus infection (COVID-19) pandemic. Results: common features established in both groups were as follows: affective instability, alexithymia, conflict relations with signicant others, and current traumatic experience. For a comparative assessment of NSSI in patients of both groups, we used the NSSI typology in adolescent PD, previously developed by the authors. Impulsive, demonstrative, addictive, depersonalizing and self-destructive types of NSSI were recognized as signicant for the diagnostic assessment. In the second group of patients, that is, during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, a change in the selected variants of NSSI was found, that is, in borderline and narcissistic PD the impulsive type was replaced by a demonstrative type, and in schizoid and anxious PD it turned into an addictive one. For a comparative assessment of NSSI in patients of both groups, we used the NSSI typology in PD in adolescence, previously developed by the authors. When assessing suicidality in group II, it was revealed that in most types of PD, with a decrease in the number of suicidal attempts, there was a noticeable increase in the incidence of NSSI with demonstrative suicidality, which correlated with the trajectories of the identied variants of NSSI. Conclusions: the study underlined the role of personality pathology in in adolescence in the development of psychopathological disorders with NSSI and their high association with suicidal activity. The modication of various NSSI variants in the context of a coronavirus infection (COVID-19) pandemic may be due to the unique characteristics of the psychotraumatic factor. With the same strength of impact, the multidirectional influence on various personality types and comorbid psychopathological disorders in adolescence should be taken into account, when creating new models of therapeutic and socio-rehabilitation interventions for the adolescent contingent of patients. ? 2021, Psychiatry (Moscow).

Time and resource restrictions, a focus on saving lives and new safety measures can lead to traditional aspects of care delivery being neglected. AIM: Identify barriers to delivering end-of-life care, describe attempts to deliver care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and understand the impact this had on staff. DESIGN: A rapid appraisal was conducted incorporating a rapid review of policies from the United Kingdom, semi-structured telephone interviews with healthcare workers, and a review of mass print media news stories and social media posts describing healthcare worker's experiences of delivering care during the pandemic. Data were coded and analysed using framework analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: From a larger ongoing study, 22 interviews which mentioned death or caring for patients at end-of-life, eight government and National Health Service policies affecting end-of-life care delivery, eight international news media stories and 3440 publicly available social media posts were identified. The social media analysis centred around 274 original tweets with the highest reach, engagement and relevance. Incorporating multiple workstreams provided a broad perspective of end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Three themes were developed: (1) restrictions to traditional care, (2) striving for new forms of care and (3) establishing identity and resilience.

However, seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) among contacts of confirmed cases can add further value to the scientific findings. Objectives: The objective is to estimate COVID-19 seropositivity among contacts of COVID-19 cases and to compare the seropositivity between types of contact for the assessment of differential risk and transmission dynamics. Methods: Large scale population-based serosurveillance on contacts of COVID-19 cases was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the COVID-Kavach. The seropositivity among contacts was estimated and correlated-compared with type of contact and other demographic factors. Results: With 1268 positive for IgG antibodies from 3973 samples, the seropositivity against COVID-19 among contacts of cases in Ahmedabad was 31.92% (95% confidence interval 30.48%-33.38%). The seropositivity among family contacts was significantly higher (39.36%) as compared to other contacts (28.72%) (Z = 6.60, P < 0.01). This trend is seen across all age groups and both the sex groups. The seropositivity has increasing trend with increasing age and is significantly higher among females (35.11%) than males (28.95%) (Z = 4.16, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Seropositivity of 31.92% among contacts indicates that a large proportion of contacts have already acquired immunity on account of their contact with the case. Higher seropositivity among family contacts justifies the risk categorization and testing strategy adopted for the contacts of the cases.

In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of nintedanib and pirfenidone on mortality following respiratory-related hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Using a large U.S. insurance database, we created a one-to-one propensity score matched cohort of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated and untreated with an antifibrotic who underwent respiratory-related hospitalization between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018. Mortality was evaluated at 30 days and end of follow-up (up to 2 years). Subgroup analyses were performed for all patients receiving treatment in an ICU and those receiving invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation during the index hospitalization. RESULTS: Antifibrotics were not observed to effect utilization of mechanical ventilation or ICU treatment during the index admission or effect mortality at 30-days. If patients survived hospitalization, mortality was reduced in the treated cohort compared to the untreated cohort when followed up to two years (20.1% vs 47.8%).

The performance metrics included fiber diameter, fiber crystallinity, fabric weight, air permeability, and contact angle. The results revealed that the optimal die temperature was 250 C. At 250 C, the fibers were of fine size with high crystallinity, independent of collector distances. Specifically, the die-to-collector distance, given the optimal die temperature, had negligible effect on the fiber diameter and crystallinity. On the other hand, the collector distance played a role in the nonwoven fabric characteristics. The collector distance was positively correlated with the elongation at break and air permeability but inversely correlated with the fabric density and tensile strength. The fabric contact angles were found to be in the range of 124C130 , indicating the hydrophobicity of PLA nonwoven fabric.

In this review, the authors have therefore compiled study design data from ongoing clinical trials to address the key questions of \\"which\\" with regard to tissue source, donor profile, isolation technique, culture conditions, long-term culture and cryopreservation of MSCs; \\"when\\" with regard to defining the transplantation window by identifying and staging patients based on their pro-inflammatory profile; and \\"how much\\" with regard to the number of cells in a single administration, number of doses and route of transplantation. To homogenize MSC therapy for COVID-19 on a global scale and to make it readily available in large numbers, a shared understanding and uniform agreement with respect to these fundamental issues are essential.","output":"Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for coronavirus disease 2019: which? when? and how much?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this population-based study was to evaluate the impact of being a cancer survivor (CS) on COVID-19 risk and prognosis during the first wave of the pandemic (27 February 2020 to 13 May 2020) in Reggio Emilia Province. Prevalent cancer cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2019 were linked with the provincial COVID-19 surveillance system. We compared CS' cumulative incidence of being tested, testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), being hospitalized and dying of COVID-19 with that of the general population; we compared COVID-19 prognosis in CS and in patients without cancer. During the study period, 15 391 people (1527 CS) underwent real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 4541 (447 CS) tested positive; 541 (113 CS) died of COVID-19. CS had higher age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) of testing (1.28 [95% confidence interval, CI = 1.21-1.35]), of positive test (IRR 1.06 [95% CI = 0.96-1.18]) and of hospitalization and death (IRR 1.27 [95% CI = 1.09-1.48] and 1.39 [95%CI = 1.12-1.71], respectively). CS had worse prognosis when diagnosed with COVID-19, particularly those below age 70 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of death 5.03; [95% CI = 2.59-9.75]), while the OR decreased after age 70. The OR of death was higher for CS with a recent diagnosis, that is, <2 years (OR = 2.92; 95% CI = 1.64-5.21), or metastases (OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 0.88-4.93). CS showed the same probability of being infected, despite a slightly higher probability of being tested than the general population.

In this study, we evaluated the serum IL-10 levels and investigated its clinical relevance in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA). METHODS: IL-10 levels were determined in 21 patients diagnosed with SoJIA and 35 patients with fever diseases which were suspected as SoJIA, and IL-10 levels were compared between SoJIA patients with regard to disease activity, disease courses, and other biomarkers. RESULTS: Patients with SoJIA had significantly higher levels of IL-10 compared to patients with other febrile diseases. The serum levels of IL-10 were significantly higher in active SoJIA compared to inactive and positively correlated with known disease activity markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein level (CRP), ferritin (FER), and IL-6 levels. Moreover, the levels of IL-10 at diagnosis were significantly higher in SoJIA patients with a nonmonocyclic pattern than in patients with a monocyclic pattern. Compared to CRP, ESR, FER, and IL-6, IL-10 levels were superior in predicting monocyclic patients from nonmonocyclic patients. CONCLUSION: Compared to other febrile diseases, SoJIA patients have markedly higher levels of IL-10 which may assist with diagnosis. And a clear association of serum IL-10 levels with disease activity and disease courses in SoJIA was found. These results suggest that serum IL-10 might be a reliable clinical marker in SoJIA.","output":"The Association of Serum IL-10 Levels with the Disease Activity in Systemic-Onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper prosed a novel 6G QoS over the future 6G wireless architecture to offer excellent Quality of Service (QoS) for the next generation of digital TV beyond 2030.

Research shows that expressing empathy to patients improves patient adherence to medications and decreases patient anxiety and the number of malpractice lawsuits. However, there is a dearth of research on teaching empathy to premedical students. The Clinical Science, Technology, and Medicine Summer Internship of Stanford Medicine (also called the Stanford Anesthesia Summer Institute) is a 2-week collaborative medical internship for high school and undergraduate students to inspire learners to be compassionate health care providers. The summer 2020 program was adapted to accomplish these objectives in a fully remote environment because of the COVID-19 global pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to measure the change in empathy and competencies of participants in clinical and communication skills before and after program participation. METHODS: A total of 41 participants completed only the core track of this program, and 39 participants completed the core + research track of this program. Participants in both tracks received instructions in selected clinical skills and interacted directly with patients to improve their interviewing skills. Research track participants received additional instructions in research methodology. All participants completed web-based pre- and postsurveys containing Knowledge and Skills Assessment (KSA) questions. Participant empathy was assessed using the validated Consultation and Relational Empathy measure. A subset of participants completed optional focus groups to discuss empathy. The pre- and post-KSA and Consultation and Relational Empathy measure scores were compared using paired 2-tailed t tests and a linear regression model. Open-ended focus group answers were then analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Participants in both tracks demonstrated significant improvement in empathy after the 2-week remote learning course (P=.007 in core track; P<.001 in research track). These results remained significant when controlling for gender and age. A lower pretest score was associated with a greater change in empathy. Participants in both tracks demonstrated significant improvement in KSA questions related to surgical skills (P<.001 in core track; P<.001 in research track), epinephrine pen use (P<.001 in core track; P<.001 in research track), x-ray image interpretation (P<.001 in core track; P<.001 in research track), and synthesizing information to solve problems (P<.001 in core track; P=.05 in research track). The core track participants also showed significant improvements in health communication skills (P=.001). Qualitative analysis yielded 3 themes: empathy as action, empathy as a mindset, and empathy in designing health care systems. CONCLUSIONS: Summer internships that introduce high school and undergraduate students to the field of health care through hands-on interaction and patient involvement may be an effective way to develop measurable empathy skills when combined with clinical skills training and mentorship.

HYPOTHESIS/GAP STATEMENT: Few large-scale epidemiological studies have investigated potential prognostic factors for morbidity and mortality in this patient group. AIM: To evaluate the risk factors for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with ILD and viral infection, as well as the clinical characteristics. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cohort study included patients with ILD who were hospitalized for a viral infection in two tertiary academic hospitals in China, between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2019. We analysed the prevalence of comorbidities, clinical characteristics, 30 day mortality rates, and prognostic risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 282 patients were included; 195 and 87 were immunocompromised and immunocompetent, respectively. The most common underlying interstitial diseases were idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (42.9 %) and connective tissue disease (36.9 %). The 30 day mortality rate was 20.6 %. During the influenza season, an increase in influenza virus (IFV) (25.7 %), respiratory syncytial virus (14.9 %) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (11.3 %) cases was observed in the immunocompromised group. The most frequently detected virus in the immunocompetent group was IFV (44.8 %), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (11.5 %), and human rhinovirus (9.2 %). During the non-influenza season, CMV (34.4 %) was the main virus detected in the immunocompromised group. The 30 day mortality rates of non-IFV patients were higher than those of IFV patients. Older age (>60 years), respiratory failure, persistent lymphocytopenia, invasive mechanical ventilation and non-IFV virus infection were significantly associated with increased 30 day mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with ILD who develop viral infection have high rates of morbidity and mortality, which are associated with increased age (>60 years), respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, persistent lymphocytopenia and non-IFV virus infection. These risk factors should be carefully considered when determining treatment strategies for this patient population.","output":"Clinical characteristics and prognostic risk factors of mortality in patients with interstitial lung diseases and viral infection: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We identified the main changes in serum metabolites associated with severe (n = 46) and mild (n = 19) COVID-19 patients by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.

Data were collected from participants from Mainland China (n=100) and Taiwan (n=100) through an online survey. Therefore, the regional differences were also examined. A smaller IPS was observed when participants faced confederates wearing surgical masks than in the no-mask condition. Female dyads tended to maintain a smaller IPS than did both male and mixed-sex dyads, and Taiwanese participants maintained a significantly larger IPS than did Mainland Chinese participants. No significant difference was observed between the active and passive pattern. Moreover, the interaction between region and mask had a significant influence on IPS perception. Among all test combinations, only the IPS perceived by Taiwanese participants facing confederates without surgical masks exceeded 1.5m.

Methods: Linear regression analysis were used to establish a linear regression model with the number of Wuhan roaming people as the dependent variable and the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Henan province as the dependent variable, and to calculate and plot the regional distribution of the number of cases in 18 cities in Henan province in accordance with the criteria of whether the number of cases exceeded the expected number. Results: There was a linear correlation between the number of people Wuhan roaming and the number of cases, and the linear regression model equation was statistically significant. The cities that exceeded the expected number of cases had a clear spatio-temporal distribution. Geographically, these cities were roughly in the 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock directions in Nanyang, and in terms of time period, the first phase (10 days), the cities that exceeded the expected number of cases changed almost daily. In the second phase (5 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases were moderated, and in the third phase (15 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases entered the stabilization phase. Conclusions: The priority cities for COVID-19 prevention and control in Henan province should pay special attention to the cities that have exceeded the expected number of COVID-19 cases, and the implementation of high-level control measures can effectively control the spread of COVID-19 within 2-4 weeks during the early stage of the epidemic.

By November 30, 2020, when this paper was written, 13.5 million cases were reported in the U.S. with over 268 000 deaths. Historically, vaccines have been one of the most effective and efficient technical tools for controlling a communicable disease. While the development of these vaccines has certainly been a challenge, it could be more challenging to achieve robust vaccine uptake because of many barriers. In this review, we focused on two types of barriers documented from long-term experience in the U.S.: structural and attitudinal. Structural barriers are systemic issues that impact one's ability to access a service, and they include time, transportation, cost, and clinic or outlet location; while attitudinal barriers are beliefs or perceptions that impact the willingness of at-risk individuals to seek out and/or accept a service. In the context of vaccination they include beliefs about the communicable disease, beliefs about vaccines, fear, and trust in healthcare and governmental agencies. Of the attitudinal barriers, public trust is a barrier that is of particular importance. In addition to affecting reception of vaccines, it may exacerbate disparities and reduce the likelihood of success of a vaccination program.

The transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 are activated by rotavirus infection, but the upstream processes leading to these events are largely unidentified. We therefore studied the activation state during rotavirus infection of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, which are kinases known to activate AP-1. As assessed by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies, infection with rhesus rotavirus (RRV) or exposure to UV-psoralen-inactivated RRV (I-RRV) resulted in the activation of JNK in HT-29, Caco-2, and MA104 cells. Activation of p38 during RRV infection was observed in Caco-2 and MA104 cells but not in HT-29 cells, whereas exposure to I-RRV did not lead to p38 activation in these cell lines. Rotavirus strains SA11, CRW-8, Wa, and UK also activated JNK and p38. Consistent with the activation of JNK, a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of the AP-1 component c-Jun was shown. The interleukin-8 (IL-8) and c-jun promoters contain AP-1 binding sequences, and these genes have been shown previously to be transcriptionally up-regulated during rotavirus infection. Using specific inhibitors of JNK (SP600125) and p38 (SB203580) and real-time PCR, we showed that maximal RRV-induced IL-8 and c-jun transcription required JNK and p38 activity.

In this work, a new multi-residue analytical method was developed and validated for the determination of 10 pharmaceuticals in wastewaters using online solid-phase extraction (online SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The compounds included in the method were antineoplastics (cabazitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide, irinotecan, methotrexate, paclitaxel, and topotecan), renin inhibitors (aliskiren), and antidepressants (maprotiline). The method was developed through several experiments on four online SPE cartridges, three reversed phase chromatography columns, and four combinations of mobile phase components. Under optimal conditions, very low limits of detection (LODs) of 1.30 to 10.6 ng L-1 were obtained. The method was repeatable, with relative standard deviations (RSD, %) for intraday and interday precisions ranged from 1.6 to 7.8 and from 3.3 to 13.2, respectively. Recovery values ranged from 78.4 to 111.4%, indicating the reproducibility of the method. Matrix effects were mainly presented as signal suppression, with topotecan and doxorubicin being the two most affected compounds (31.0% signal suppression). The proposed method was successfully applied to hospital effluents, detecting methotrexate (4.7-9.3 ng L-1) and maprotiline (11.2-23.1 ng L-1). Due to the shorter overall run time of 15 min, including sample preparation, and reduced sample volume (0.9 mL), this on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS method was extremely convenient and efficient in comparison to the classical off-line SPE method.

This study compared Fac and Stu perceptions surrounding academic integrity when using technology assisted proctoring in online testing. Methods: College Fac (N = 150) and Stu (N = 78) completed a survey about perceptions of academic integrity and use of proctoring software for online testing. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to determine if there were differences in the distribution of agreement between students and faculty. Results: Fac and Stu agreed maintaining academic integrity was a priority (93 vs. 94%), and that it is easier to cheat in online tests (81 vs. 83%). Responses differed on whether online proctoring software was effective at preventing academic dishonesty (23% of Fac vs. 42% of Stu disagreed). 53% of Fac and 70% of Stu perceived that online proctoring was an invasion of privacy. Only 7% of Stu and 49% of Fac perceived importance in having a policy about proctoring online tests, whether cheating in an academic setting is likely associated with cheating in a work setting (78 vs. 51%), and if given a choice, 46% of Fac and only 2% of Stu would choose to use proctoring software. Answers to open-ended questions identified feelings of stress and anxiety by Stu and concerns about privacy by Fac. Conclusion: Fac and Stu had similar perceptions of the importance of academic integrity and ease of cheating in online tests. They differed in perception of proctoring softwares effectiveness in deterring cheating, choosing to give or take a proctored online test, and having a policy in place.

In rural regions, where the majority of the population reside, empirical treatment guidelines derived from central urban hospitals are often of limited relevance. In these settings, health workers with limited training deliver care, often without any laboratory diagnostic support. In this paper, we model the impact of point-of-care C-reactive protein testing to inform the decision to prescribe antibiotics and regional surveillance data to inform antibiotic selection, and then simulate the subsequent impact on mortality from febrile illnesses, rooted in the real-world context of rural Savannakhet province, southern Laos. Methods: Our model simulates 100 scenarios with varying quarterly incidence of six key pathogens known to be prevalent in rural Laos. In the simulations, community health workers either prescribe antibiotics in-line with current practice as documented in health facilities in rural Laos, or with the aid of the two interventions. We provide cost-effectiveness estimates for each strategy alone and then for an integrated approach using both interventions. Results: We find that each strategy is predicted to be highly cost-effective, and that the combined approach is predicted to result in the biggest reduction in mortality (averting a predicted 510 deaths per year in rural Savannakhet, a 28% reduction compared to standard practice) and is highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of just $66 per disability-adjusted life year averted. Conclusions: Substantial seasonal variation in the predicted optimal empirical antibiotic treatment for febrile illness highlights the benefits of up-to-date information on regional causes of fever. In this modelling analysis, an integrated system incorporating point-of-care host biomarker testing and regional surveillance data appears highly cost-effective, and may warrant piloting in a real-life setting.","output":"Accounting for aetiology: can regional surveillance data alongside host biomarker-guided antibiotic therapy improve treatment of febrile illness in remote settings?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the scaling of the surface roughness of coronavirus, including the SARS-nCoV based on fractal and spectral analyses of their published electron microscopy images.

Specifically, participants who kept feelings to themselves tended to have higher CES-D scores than those who let their feelings show, while those who sought out authority scored lower on the CES-D, on average than those that did not seek authority.ConclusionsHealthcare staff are under greater stress and pressure during national emergencies, and to regulate emotions during consistent high-stress, our preliminary data suggest that suppression and distraction strategies are dominant.

This paper focuses on conceptual tools to improve our understanding of these crises as well as the facilitating factors and barriers for sustainability governance to play a role in transitioning to profoundly more sustainable societies than those that currently exist. Bioenergy is used throughout the paper as an example to aid contextually in understanding the theoretical and abstract arguments. We first define eight premises upon which our argumentation is developed. We then define sustainability, sustainability transition, legitimacy, and trust as a premise for obtaining effectiveness in communication and minimising risks associated with misunderstanding key terms. We proceed to examine the literature on good governance in order to reflect upon what defines \\"good sustainability governance\\" and what makes governance systems successful in achieving their goals. We propose input, output, and throughput legitimacy as three principles constituting good sustainability governance and propose associated open-ended criteria as a basis for developing operational standards for assessing the quality of a sustainability governance system or complex. As sustainability governance systems must develop to remain relevant, we also suggest an adaptive governance model, where continuous re-evaluation of the sustainability governance system design supports the system in remaining good in conditions that are complex and dynamic. Finally, we pull from the literature in a broad range of sciences to propose a conceptual governance research framework that aims to facilitate an integrated understanding of how the design of sustainability governance systems influences the legitimacy and trust granted to them by relevant actors. The framework is intended to enhance the adaptive features of sustainability governance systems so as to allow the identification of the causes of existing and emerging sustainability governance crises and finding solutions to them. Knowledge generated from its use may form a basis for providing policy recommendations on how to practically solve complex legitimacy and trust crises related to sustainability governance.

Monolaurin (ML) is a natural compound with a wide range of antibacterial and antiviral activities. However, the role of ML in PEDV infection is still unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ML on the growth performance, intestinal function, virus replication and cytokine response in piglets infected with PEDV, and to reveal the mechanism through proteomics analysis. Piglets were orally administrated with ML at a dose of 100 mg/kgBW for 7 days before PEDV infection. Results showed that although there was no significant effect on the growth performance of piglets, ML administration alleviated the diarrhea caused by PEDV infection. ML administration promoted the recovery of intestinal villi, thereby improving intestinal function. Meanwhile, PEDV replication was significantly inhibited, and PEDV-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 were decreased with ML administration. Proteomics analyses showed that 38 proteins were differentially expressed between PEDV and ML+PEDV groups and were significantly enriched in the interferon-related pathways. This suggests ML could promote the restoration of homeostasis by regulating the interferon pathway. Overall, the present study demonstrated ML could confer a protective effect against PEDV infection in piglets and may be developed as a drug or feed additive to prevent and control PEDV disease.","output":"Monolaurin Confers a Protective Effect Against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection in Piglets by Regulating the Interferon Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic stenosis of the left common carotid artery ostium (LCCAO) represents a technical challenge. Unlike stenting of other supra-aortic trunk lesions, LCCAO stenting is not able to be performed from a retrograde approach through the brachial artery. Stenting may be performed via a retrograde approach with a carotid artery cut-down or with total endovascular technique via a transfemoral approach. A consecutive case series is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of the endovascular transfemoral LCCAO stenting technique. METHODS Our prospectively maintained database of elective neuroendovascular procedures was searched for cases of LCCAO angioplasty and stenting for atherosclerotic stenosis performed between January 2003 and April 2012. Cases identified were isolated and analyzed for clinical and anatomic data. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of periprocedural (30-day) neurological or cardiopulmonary complications. RESULTS Fourteen patients were treated with a transfemoral approach (mean arterial stenosis 72%; symptomatic lesions 86%). Six (43%) had tandem stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery. In these cases, embolic protection was used. Stent revascularization was a technical success in all 14 patients, resulting in <20% residual stenosis in each. One intraprocedural complication (transient ischemic attack) was noted in a patient with symptomatic stenosis. One additional patient was identified who was treated with retrograde stenting due to bilateral leg amputations and no femoral access, with no periprocedural complication. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, transfemoral stenting of stenotic LCCAO lesions is feasible and no permanent neurological or cardiopulmonary sequelae occurred in 14 patients treated with this technique.","output":"Transfemoral endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic stenotic lesions of the left common carotid artery ostium: case series and review of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus pandemic is a current global health crisis. Many chiropractic institutions, associations, and researchers have stepped up at a time of need. However, a subset of the chiropractic profession has claimed that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is clinically effective in improving ones immunity, despite the lack of supporting scientific evidence. These unsubstantiated claims contradict official public health policy reflecting poorly on the profession. The aim of this commentary is to provide our perspective on the claims regarding SMT and clinically relevant immunity enhancement, drawing attention to the damaging ramifications these claims might have on our professions reputation. MAIN TEXT: The World Federation of Chiropractic released a rapid review demonstrating the lack of clinically relevant evidence regarding SMT and immunity enhancement. The current claims contradicting this review carry significant potential risk to patients. Furthermore, as a result of these misleading claims, significant media attention and public critiques of the profession are being made. We believe inaction by regulatory bodies will lead to confusion among the public and other healthcare providers, unfortunately damaging the professions reputation. The resulting effect on the reputation of the profession is greatly concerning to us, as students. CONCLUSION: It is our hope that all regulatory bodies will protect the public by taking appropriate action against chiropractors making unfounded claims contradicting public health policy. We believe it is the responsibility of all stakeholders in the chiropractic profession to ensure this is carried out and the standard of care is raised. We call on current chiropractors to ensure a viable profession exists moving forward.","output":"Chiropractic students call for action against unsubstantiated claims"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malawi, a vulnerable country in Sub Saharan Africa is at the helm of experiencing food insecure amidst COVID-19 as the vast majority survives on the hand-to-mouth economy. However, knowledge about how COVID-19 policy measures leads to food insecurity among the urban residents in Malawi is limited or scanty. Understanding this link is crucial for designing the interventions that can help reduce the risk of being food insecure while containing further spread of the virus. Our study explores the nexus between COVID-19 policy measures and food insecurity as experienced by Blantyre residents in Malawi. We interviewed fifteen participants composed of private secondary school teachers and informal workers to understand their experiences of food insecurity linked to COVID-19 policy measures in place by the Malawi government. Our results show that participants face difficulties to access adequate food and have also changed their eating habits by skipping meals in some days as a result of closing night clubs, bars, and schools, restricting public gatherings, and reducing passengers boarding minibus. Therefore, we argue that the COVID-19 policies in place by the Malawi government aggravates the severe challenges to access enough food rendering urban residents vulnerable to food insecurity.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 policy measures on food insecurity among urban residents in Blantyre City, Malawi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease has disrupted tuberculosis services globally.

Serological cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was investigated by peptide spot assay. RESULTS Ninety-five of 142 residents (67%) and 53 of 160 staff members (33%) experienced symptoms of respiratory infection. Symptomatic residents experienced cough (66%), fever (21%) and pneumonia (12%). Eight residents died, six with pneumonia. No staff members developed pneumonia. Findings on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays for SARS-CoV at a national reference laboratory were suspected to represent false positives, but this was confounded by concurrent identification of antibody to N protein on serology. Subsequent testing by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed HCoV-OC43 infection. Convalescent serology ruled out SARS. Notably, sera demonstrated cross-reactivity against nucleocapsid peptide sequences common to HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV.

Moreover, it was reported that the percentage of the lung showing GGO, and consolidation is tied to disease severity. Thus, segmentation of ground-glass opacities and consolidations in CT images will help to quantify disease severity and assist physicians in disease triage, management, and prognosis.

However, many stochastic simulations are needed to reduce the associated sampling error. To remedy the shortcomings of stochastic simulation, we developed a numerical method that allows predicting the efficacy of arbitrary prophylactic regimen directly from a viral dynamics model, without sampling. We apply the method to various hypothetical dolutegravir (DTG) prophylaxis scenarios. The approach is verified against state-of-the-art stochastic simulation. While the method is more accurate than stochastic simulation, it is superior in terms of computational performance. For example, a continuous 6-month prophylactic profile is computed within a few seconds on a laptop computer.

Uncertainty about the virus symptomatology was associated with less frequent mask-wearing and handwashing. Increased social support, frequent media use for COVID-19 updates, trust to authorities, older age, worse health status, female gender and being a healthcare professional were also associated with uptake of some preventive health behaviors.

We also perform sensitivity analyses to identify key model parameters and mechanisms contributing to the observed disease burden in the three months following the first observed cases on COVID-19 in Michigan. We then consider several scenarios for relaxing restrictions and reopening workplaces to predict what actions would be most prudent. In particular, we consider the effects of 1) different timings for reopening, and 2) different levels of workplace vs. casual contact re-engagement.

It has been proposed that recruitment of RTA to the SRL is facilitated by ribosomal P-stalk proteins, whose C-terminal domains interact with a cavity on RTA normally masked by RTB; however, evidence that this interaction is critical for RTA activity within cells is lacking. Here, we characterized a collection of single-domain antibodies (V(H)Hs) whose epitopes overlap with the P-stalk binding pocket on RTA. The crystal structures of three such V(H)Hs (V9E1, V9F9, and V9B2) in complex with RTA revealed not only occlusion of the ribosomal P-stalk binding pocket but also structural mimicry of C-terminal domain peptides by complementarity-determining region 3. In vitro assays confirmed that these V(H)Hs block RTACP-stalk peptide interactions and protect ribosomes from depurination. Moreover, when expressed as intrabodies, these V(H)Hs rendered cells resistant to ricin intoxication. One V(H)H (V9F6), whose epitope was structurally determined to be immediately adjacent to the P-stalk binding pocket, was unable to neutralize ricin within cells or protect ribosomes from RTA in vitro.

Evidence for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) was uncertain (RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.69 - 100.03).

In the 2016/2017 financial year, the National Health Service (NHS) in England set a national performance-based incentive to increase uptake of the influenza vaccination among frontline staff. Since then, the threshold levels needed for hospital trusts to achieve the incentive (ie, the targets) have ranged from 70% to 80%. The present study examines the impact of this financial incentive across eight vaccination seasons. DESIGN A retrospective observational study examining routinely recorded rates of influenza vaccination among staff in all acute NHS hospital trusts across eight vaccination seasons (2012/2013-2019/2020). The number of trusts included varied per year, from 127 to 137, due to organisational changes. McCrary's density test is conducted to determine if the number of hospital trusts narrowly achieving the target by the end of each season is higher than would be expected in the absence of any responsiveness to the target. We refer to this bunching above the target threshold as a 'threshold effect'. RESULTS In the years before a national incentive was set, 9%-31% of NHS Trusts reported achieving the target, compared with 43%-74% in the 4 years after. Threshold effects did not emerge before the national incentive for payment was set; however, since then, threshold effects have appeared every year. Some trusts report narrowly achieving the target each year, both as the target rises and falls. Threshold effects were not apparent at targets for partial payments. CONCLUSIONS We provide compelling evidence that performance-based financial incentives produced threshold effects. Policymakers who set such incentives are encouraged to track threshold effects since they contain information on how organisations are responding to an incentive, what enquiries they may wish to make, how the incentive may be improved and what unintended effects it may be having.","output":"Examining organisational responses to performance-based financial incentive systems: a case study using NHS staff influenza vaccination rates from 2012/2013 to 2019/2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Learning from imbalanced datasets is a challenging task for standard classification algorithms.

Characterizing anemia as microcytic and normocytic depends on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which is an important parameter in differentiating many types of anemia. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. In this study, we aimed to assess the Mentzer index used by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Palestine as a useful tool in differentiating between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thalassemia. We assessed for the prevalence of IDA among infants at the age of one year visiting the mother centers from seven West Bank provinces in Palestine. Medical records and hematology laboratory data of 3262 infants were retrospectively analyzed from the years of 2018 to 2020. The Mentzer index applied to all population by dividing mean corpuscular volume (MCV, in fL) by the red blood cell count (RBC, in millions per microliter). A corrected Mentzer index was further calculated among anemic infants to include only microcytic (MCV with less than 72 fl) and hypochromic (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) with less than 32 g/L) indices. Mentzer index calculations for the whole population showed that 29.1% were anemic (hemoglobin (HGB) less than 11 g/dl): 21.1% had mild anemia, 7.6% had moderate anemia, while 0.2% had severe anemia. The corrected Mentzer index calculations showed a prevalence of 5.9% and 3.2% among IDA and thalassemia infants, respectively. Severity of anemia was correlated with low body weight and infants born through cesarean mother birth with no interference with gender influence. CBC indices of RBC count, HGB, MCV, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) showed a significant difference (p values < 0.05) between IDA and thalassemia infants' populations following the corrected Mentzer index. With the corrected Mentzer index, we introduced a new CBC index among infants at the age of 1 year in Palestine. These lab references could aid in differentiating IDA and thalassemia among the population and improve initial diagnosis screenings. The Mentzer index calculation for the whole population did not necessarily include cases of IDA, and therefore, it is recommended to comprise microcytic and hypochromic anemia indices prior to performing the Mentzer index.","output":"A Retrospective Study Using Mentzer Index for Prevalence of Iron Deficiency Anemia among Infants Visiting Maternal Centers at the Age of One Year"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current study, the authors demonstrate the method aimed at analyzing the distribution of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) cases in Saint Petersburg.

Their black-box nature has sparked many recent works to explain the prediction via input feature attribution methods (aka saliency methods). However, input feature attribution methods merely identify the importance of input regions for the prediction and lack semantic interpretation of model behavior. In this work, we first identify the semantics associated with internal units (feature maps) of the network. We proceed to investigate the following questions;Does a regression model that is only trained with COVID-19 severity scores implicitly learn visual patterns associated with thoracic pathologies? Does a network that is trained on weakly labeled data (e.g. healthy, unhealthy) implicitly learn pathologies? Moreover, we investigate the effect of pretraining and data imbalance on the interpretability of learned features. In addition to the analysis, we propose semantic attribution to semantically explain each prediction.

METHODS: Two groups were established in the study consisting of: one group for cases of acute appendicitis before the 2019-nCoV epidemic (before January 1, 2020; pre-epidemic group) and another group for those after the epidemic outbreak (after January 1, 2020; epidemic group). These two groups were compared in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics, prevalence of complicated appendicitis, and treatment intention. A multivariate analysis model using binary logistic regression was constructed. RESULTS: A total of 163 patients were included in this study, with 105 in the pre-epidemic group and 58 in the epidemic group. In the epidemic group, the interval from the onset of symptoms to admission was 65.0 h, which is significantly longer than the 17.3 h interval noted in the pre-epidemic group (P < 0.001). The prevalence of complicated appendicitis after the epidemic outbreak was significantly higher than before the outbreak (51.7% vs. 12.4%, P < 0.001). In addition, the epidemic group had a lower score of patient's intention to seek treatment than the pre-epidemic group (9.5  2.7 vs. 3.4  2.6, P < 0.001). Based on the multivariate analysis, the risk factors for complicated appendicitis included the time from symptoms onset to admission (OR = 1.075) and the patients' intention to receive treatment (OR = 0.541).

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) were used to assess the participants' activity and resilience levels. The Kruskal-Wallis Test was used to examine differences in PA across resilience levels. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between resilience and PA levels. Data were reported as medians and interquartile ranges. RESULTS: In total, 1859 individuals were included in the study (40% aged 26-35 years). The findings showed that 85% of the respondents engaged in PA and 15% were physically inactive. The majority (71%) participated in moderate-intensity PA. The median resilience score was 3.50 (0.85), indicating a medium level of resilience. A positive correlation was shown between the average resilience score and both walking (rs=0.01, P<0.001) and vigorous-intensity PA (rs=0.08, P=0.007).

As these symptoms are quite uncommon in other respiratory infections, their specificity and prevalence are useful features for the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. The objective was to describe taste and smell alterations in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to define the onset of those disorders during the clinical course of the disease. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods This study was conducted on adult patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection through nasopharyngeal swab at a Local Healthcare Trust in Northern Italy between April 27th and May 27th, 2020. In order to investigate the clinical course, the onset of the first symptoms, smell and/or taste alterations, a phone-based questionnaire was administered during the programming of the second nasopharyngeal swab. Results We recruited 168 patients; the mean age was 52 years old, and 94 (56.0%) were female. Among the 135 symptomatic patients, 87 (64.4%) reported taste and smell alterations. Patients with a mild clinical course showed the highest prevalence for taste and smell disorders (76.6%), which were also associated with a more benign clinical course of the disease (P = 0.0166). Furthermore, in 33 (37.9%) of these patients, changes in smell and taste perception appeared before the acute phase of the disease. Among the 14 patients with a severe clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8 reported a variation of taste and smell perception before the hospitalization, with a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7).

From a clinical point of view, differentiation of the two disease entities is crucial for patient management. We therefore aim to detect clinical differences between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and seasonal influenza patients at time of hospital admission. METHODS: In this single-center observational study, we included all consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or influenza between November 2019 and May 2020. Data were extracted from a nationwide surveillance program and from electronic health records. COVID-19 and influenza patients were compared in terms of baseline characteristics, clinical presentation and outcome. We used recursive partitioning to generate a classification tree to discriminate COVID-19 from influenza patients. RESULTS: We included 96 COVID-19 and 96 influenza patients. Median age was 68 vs. 70 years (p = 0.90), 72% vs. 56% (p = 0.024) were males, and median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 1 vs. 2 (p = 0.027) in COVID-19 and influenza patients, respectively. Time from symptom onset to hospital admission was longer for COVID-19 (median 7 days, IQR 3-10) than for influenza patients (median 3 days, IQR 2-5, p < 0.001). Other variables favoring a diagnosis of COVID-19 in the classification tree were higher systolic blood pressure, lack of productive sputum, and lack of headache.

Evidence quality levels and recommendations were assessed using the GRADE system. RESULTS: Eleven cohort studies with 536,105 patients and two RCTs were identified. Vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/ml) or insufficiency (< 30 ng/ml) was not associated with an significant increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR for < 20 ng/ml: 1.61, 95% CI: 0.92C2.80, I2 = 92%) or in-hospital death (OR for < 20 ng/ml: 2.18, 95% CI: 0.91C5.26, I2 = 72%; OR for < 30 ng/ml: 3.07, 95% CI: 0.64C14.78, I2 = 66%).

METHODS: A confirmed case was defined as a patient with positive results by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. Both specimen types were collected over the whole clinical course in all patients. Asymptomatic patients who had been screened for COVID-19 due to a strong epidemiologic link were also enrolled. The study population included 54 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 shows a very high viral load on the day of symptom development which then decreases overall. Rapid viral proliferation was observed 0C5 days before symptoms developed. Cycle threshold (Ct) value was lowest in clinical course from 5 days before symptoms to 10 days after symptoms occurred(Ct < 30). The rRT-PCR results were negative approximately 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. However, there was a continuous pattern that was negative and positive for up to 6 weeks and more. CONCLUSION: Considering the characteristic that COVID-19 has a high viral load before symptoms appear, it is necessary to consider to expand the scope of epidemiological investigations. Since there is very low possibility of transmission after 10 days of symptom occurrence, it may be considered to release isolation after 10 days of symptom occurrence in limited resource situations.

In this paper, we describe the multipronged approach used to increase the University of North Carolina Academy of Medical Educators event attendance from 30 to 1,000 faculty participants over the course of one academic year (2018-2019). This paper provides a model as to how medical societies can use ecological systems theory as a natural and comprehensive approach to plan and improve their member engagement and experience.","output":"Reinvigorating an Academy of Medical Educators Using Ecological Systems Theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been known since the early 1980s that Byzantine Agreement in the full information, asynchronous model is impossible to solve deterministically against even one crash fault [FLP85], but that it can be solved with probability 1 [Ben83], even against an adversary that controls the scheduling of all messages and corrupts up to $f<n/3$ players [Bra87]. The main downside of [Ben83, Bra87] is that they terminate in $2^{\\\\Theta(n)}$ rounds in expectation whenever $f=\\\\Theta(n)$. King and Saia [KS16, KS18(arXiv:1812.10169)] developed a polynomial protocol (polynomial rounds, polynomial computation) that is resilient to $f<(1.14\\\\times 10^{-9})n$ Byzantine faults. The new idea in their protocol is to detect -- and blacklist -- coalitions of likely-bad players by analyzing the deviations of random variables generated by those players over many rounds. In this work we design a simple collective coin-flipping protocol such that if any coalition of faulty players repeatedly does not follow protocol, then they will eventually be detected by one of two simple statistical tests. Using this coin-flipping protocol, we solve Byzantine Agreement in a polynomial number of rounds, even in the presence of up to $f<n/4$ Byzantine faults. This comes close to the $f<n/3$ upper bound on the maximum number of faults [BT85,FLM86,LSP82].","output":"Byzantine Agreement in Polynomial Time with Near-Optimal Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bootstrap financing refers to measures that entrepreneurial ventures undertake to preserve li-quidity (e.g., reducing expenses, collecting receivables, delaying payments, preselling). Prior research shows that bootstrap financing is an important enabler for the growth of resource-constrained early-stage ventures. However, little is known about the use of bootstrap financing in crises, during which the preservation of liquidity is particularly salient. We investigate the determinants of bootstrap financing in the 2020 COVID-19 crisis using a sample of 17,046 German entrepreneurial ventures. We formulate hypotheses about the determinants of bootstrap financing from a necessity, human capital, and opportunity cost perspective. Amongst others, our results show that the severity of the crisis for the venture, the level of private consumption, and self-employment experience are positively associated with an increased use of bootstrap financing measures. Our study contributes to the literature on bootstrap financing and illuminates how entrepreneurial ventures maintain liquidity in crises.","output":"The Determinants of Bootstrap Financing in Crises: Evidence from Entrepreneurial Ventures in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreads in 216 countries and territories among the world including all Eastern Mediterranean Region countries. The aim of the present study was to examine variation of COVID-19 in different income class countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Methods: : Five parameters such as the percentage of variation COVID-19 confirmed cases, the percentage of variation number of deaths, death rate per 1000 confirmed cases, the percentage of variation death rate per 1000 confirmed cases, and tests per one million were calculated. Results: : The results demonstrated that all Eastern Mediterranean Region countries increase in percentage of COVID-19 confirmed cases except Tunisia, the increasing range from 53.5% in Libya to 4.7% in Morocco. Death rate per 1000 confirmed cases range from 230.1 in Yemen to 0.92 in Qatar.

Methods In this prospective study, 21 healthy male horses underwent celiotomy. Skin closure was either performed via a continuous percutaneous pattern (CO group; 5 warmbloods/5 ponies) or an intradermal pattern (ID group; 5 warmbloods/6 ponies). Follow-up examination of the incisional site included daily monitoring for edema, dehiscence, and drainage. Transcutaneous ultrasound was performed at Days 3, 6, and 10 as well as on Week 8 and 12 to evaluate size of edema and presence or absence of sinus formation, and hernia formation. Prevalence of incisional infection on base of positive microbiological analysis at any time up to Day 10 was evaluated and compared between ID and CO group. Furthermore, edema size was analysed by a linear mixed-effect model for group and time dependency. Results Observed incisional complications included edema (9/10 in CO, 10/11 in ID), suture sinus formation (2/10 in CO, 1/11 in ID), surgical site infection (2/10 in CO, 0/11 in ID), and incisional hernia (1/10 in CO, 0/11 in ID). The overall prevalence of incisional infection was 9.5% without significant differences between both groups (20% in CO, 0% in ID; p = 0.214). Edema size was not dependent on time or group (p = 0.545 and p = 0.627, respectively).

These gene lesions unexpectedly resulted in the retention of the downstream introns, thereby increasing the length of the dystrophin mRNA by 20.2 and 36 kb, respectively. Splice-switching antisense oligomers targeted to exon 16 excised this in-frame exon and the following intron from the patient dystrophin transcript very efficiently in vitro, thereby restoring the reading frame and allowing synthesis of near-normal levels of a putatively functional dystrophin isoform. In contrast, targeting splice-switching oligomers to exon 45 in patient cells promoted only modest levels of an out-of-frame dystrophin transcript after transfection at high oligomer concentrations, whereas dual targeting of exons 44 and 45 or 45 and 46 resulted in more efficient exon skipping, with concomitant removal of intron 45. The splice site mutations reported here appear highly amenable to antisense oligomer intervention.

The subjective data from 210 game players (both males and females) about audio quality during conversation, the video quality, the overall quality, and the weighted percentage of video and voice have been collected from small competition events of the Garena ROV (Arena of Valor) in Hua Hin, Thailand. The data from 160 game players have been used to create the models, while the data from 50 game players have been applied for model performance evaluation. After developing the models, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) technique has been utilized for model evaluation. On completion of this study, it was found that two thirds of the proposed models provide better performance than the other previous works. All of them, called MOS(Audiovisual-MOBA1) model, MOS(Audiovisual-MOBA2) model and MOS(Audiovisual-MOBA3) model, show excellent performances with MAPE values of 4.95%, 5.92% and 4.75% respectively.

More than 100 pathogenic genes and loci related to spastic paraplegia symptoms have been reported. HSPs have the same core clinical features, including progressive spasticity in the lower limbs, though HSPs are heterogeneous (eg, clinical signs, MRI features, gene mutation). The age of onset varies greatly, from infant to adulthood. In addition, the slow and variable rates of disease progression in patients with HSP represent a substantial challenge for informative assessment of therapeutic efficacy. To address this, we are undertaking a prospective cohort study to investigate geneticCclinical characteristics, find surrogates for monitoring disease progress and identify clinical readouts for treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this case-control cohort study, we will enrol 200 patients with HSP and 200 healthy individuals in parallel. Participants will be continuously assessed for 3 years at 12-month intervals. Six aspects, including clinical signs, genetic spectrum, cognitive competence, MRI features, potential biochemical indicators and nerve electrophysiological factors, will be assessed in detail. This study will observe clinical manifestations and disease severity based on different molecular mechanisms, including oxidative stress, cholesterol metabolism and microtubule dynamics, all of which have been proposed as potential treatment targets or modalities. The analysis will also assess disease progression in different types of HSPs and cellular pathways with a longitudinal study using t tests and (2) tests.

We also examined how objectively measured physical activity correlated with physical fitness, body composition, and disease burden. Daily physical activity, body composition, serum parameters, comorbidity index, sit-to-stand, and hand-grip strength tests were measured in 14 HD patients. Daily physical activity was measured using the Actigraph GT9X accelerometer. The Dialysis Symptom Index questionnaire was also used.

The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalised interoperable digital healthcare solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions, has led to lack of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalised interoperable digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data policies would address the pandemic crisis.Method: This is a review paper. Two approaches were used: A comprehensive bibliographic review with R statistical methods of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed literature and Web of Science Core Collection, supported with Google Scholar search. In addition, a case study review of emerging new approaches in different regions, using medical literature, academic literature, news articles, and other reliable data sources.Results: Most countries digital responses involve big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing travel history from individuals location databases, code scanning, and individuals online reporting. Public responses of mistrust about privacy data misuse differ across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy. We propose predictive, preventive and personalised solutions for pandemic management, based on social machines and connected devices.Solutions: The proposed predictive, preventive and personalised solutions are based on the integration of IoT data, wearables devices data, mobile apps data, and individual data inputs from registered users, operating as a social machine with strong security and privacy protocols. We present solutions that would enable much greater speed in future responses. These solutions are enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and devices (internet of things).Conclusion: Inadequate data for risk assessment on speed and urgency of COVID-19, combined with increased globalisation of human society, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Despite an abundance of digital methods that could be used in slowing or stopping COVID-19 and future pandemics, the world remains unprepared and lessons have not been learned from previous cases of pandemics.

Methods: : This study undertook a cross-sectional design to survey a convenience sample of 681 residents of North London on their social distancing behaviours, demographics, housing situation, politics, psychology and social support using an online questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to measure the associations between these explanatory factors and non-adherence to all social distancing rules and intentional non-adherence to social distancing rules. Results: : The majority (92.8%) of participants did not adhere to all social distancing rules and nearly half (48.6%) engaged in intentional non-adherence of rules. The odds of not adhering to all social distancing rules increased if a participant was not identified as highly vulnerable to COVID-19 [OR=4.5], had lower control over others distancing [OR=.724], had lower control over responsibilities for which coming into contact with others was unavoidable [OR=.642], and if social distancing behaviours were reported after lockdown was first relaxed [OR=.261]. The odds of intentionally not adhering to social distancing rules increased if a participant had a lower intention to socially distance [OR=.468], had lower control over others distancing [OR=.829], had a doctoral degree compared to a masters degree [OR=.332], a professional qualification [OR=.307], a bachelors degree [OR=.361] or work-related qualification [OR=.174], voted for the UK Government compared to not voting for the Government [OR=.461], perceived higher normative pressure from neighbours [OR=1.121] and had greater support from friends [OR=1.465]. Conclusions: : Non-adherence to all social distancing rules had a stronger association with vulnerability to COVID-19 and control over social distancing, whereas intentional non-adherence had a stronger association with intention and anti-social psychological factors. It is recommended that people living in high-risk environments, such as those living in houses of multiple occupancy, should be specially supported to not have to leave their home, that public health messaging should emphasise shared responsibility and public consciousness and that there should be greater policing, larger fines and more direct issuing of fines.","output":"Factors Associated with Non-Adherence to Social Distancing Rules During The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Logistic Regression Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) can inhibit the invasion and proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in cultured cells, the repurposing of these antimalarial drugs was considered a promising strategy for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

Infectious disease pandemics can overwhelm adaptive coping capacity (e.g., general self-efficacy and resilience) and increase the risk for mental distress. For individuals experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and cohabitating with a perpetrator, stay-at-home orders can also increase risk of violence, which can further exacerbate mental distress. The present study explores womens perceived self-efficacy and resilient coping, mental health outcomes (depression and COVID-19 related anxiety), hazardous alcohol use and IPV in the context of Ugandas national 2020 lockdown. METHODS: A phone-based survey was undertaken from June-August of 2020 in Wakiso District, Uganda. The study sample consisted of Africa Medical and Behavioral Sciences Organization (AMBSO) Population Health Surveillance (APHS) study participants who agreed to be contacted for future research. The analytic sample was restricted to women aged 13C80 years. Bivariate analysis and multivariable models explored associations between experiences of IPV and measures of adaptive coping, mental health and alcohol use. RESULTS: A total of 556 women aged 13C79 years (mean age of 33.4 years) participated. Over half (55%) were currently married. The majority (60%) reported a decrease in alcohol use during the lockdown. Nearly half of the sample were experiencing physical or verbal IPV and reported an increase in violence during the lockdown. In adjusted analysis, alcohol use was associated with four times greater odds of recent physical IPV (aOR 4.06, 95% CI = 1.65C10.02, p = 0.0024), while participants had lower odds of experiencing any form of IPV as general self-efficacy increased (aOR 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91C0.99, p = 0.0308). CONCLUSION: Lockdown measures in Uganda may have mitigated increased alcohol consumption. IPV was exacerbated during lockdown; more than 2 in 5 IPV victims experienced increased physical or verbal violence. Development of programming and policies aimed at mitigating womens risk of IPV during future lockdowns are needed.","output":"Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on womens alcohol use, mental health, and experiences of intimate partner violence in Wakiso, Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Todays societies are connected to a level that has never been seen before. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of such an unprecedently connected world. As of 19 November 2020, over 56 million people have been infected with nearly 1.35 million deaths, and the numbers are growing. The state-of-the-art social media analytics for COVID-19-related studies to understand the various phenomena happening in our environment are limited and require many more studies. This paper proposes a software tool comprising a collection of unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) machine learning and other methods for the analysis of Twitter data in Arabic with the aim to detect government pandemic measures and public concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tool is described in detail, including its architecture, five software components, and algorithms. Using the tool, we collect a dataset comprising 14 million tweets from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for the period 1 February 2020 to 1 June 2020. We detect 15 government pandemic measures and public concerns and six macro-concerns (economic sustainability, social sustainability, etc.), and formulate their information-structural, temporal, and spatio-temporal relationships. For example, we are able to detect the timewise progression of events from the public discussions on COVID-19 cases in mid-March to the first curfew on 22 March, financial loan incentives on 22 March, the increased quarantine discussions during MarchCApril, the discussions on the reduced mobility levels from 24 March onwards, the blood donation shortfall late March onwards, the governments 9 billion SAR (Saudi Riyal) salary incentives on 3 April, lifting the ban on five daily prayers in mosques on 26 May, and finally the return to normal government measures on 29 May 2020.

This turned into a global pandemic in a short period of time. Covid-19 is a novel strain of corona virus that was not seen earlier in human beings. It is important to study the molecular structure of Covid-19 so as to aid in the development of therapeutic measures. Existing Covid-19 pandemic poses an extraordinary risk to health and healthcare systems worldwide. Corona viruses are made of single stranded RNA present within the coat proteins. The virus has a diameter of nearly 80C120 nm. Usually, Covid-19 presents with the signs and symptoms of respiratory illness. Cough commonly dry cough, fever, associated with myalgias and sometimes breathing difficulties due to decrease in oxygen saturation rates are also present in these patients. Some people show fever with body aches, while some are relatively asymptomatic. Corona virus is primarily transmitted in humans through respiratory route and is highly contagious. Mostly old people and those having comorbid illnesses suffer most. After invading into the human body, the virus may lead to a sequence of processes such as viral invasion, replication, and programmed cell death, that is, apoptosis. To control and prevent this viral infection, we need to study the molecular aspects of Covid-19 in detail so as to design therapeutic agents as well as for vaccine formation. The micro-RNA is defined as the single-stranded noncoding RNA molecule. They have a length of about 22 nucleotides approximately and help in the post transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Micro RNAs regulate many types of cancers in addition to Covid-19 and other infections. Viral micro RNA is a newer type of mi-RNA and controls the host cell expression and viral target genes. This was completed by inducing micro-RNA cleavage, breakdown, translation, inhibition, or other mechanisms. The micro-RNAs of Covid-19 are explained to give an authoritative means to study this novel coronavirus. These control the host cell expression and also viral target genes by inducing micro-RNA cleavage, breakdown, translation, inhibition, and also other mechanisms.","output":"Covid-19: a novel challenge to human immune genetic machinery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we examined the employee service dimensions which are associated with satisfaction and customers intention to revisit among Uzbekistani customers who visit halal restaurants in Korea We also investigated the situational factor of the pandemic outbreak and the moderating role of the restaurant locations A total of 264 respondents participated The results revealed that behavior quality and appearance were important employee service quality dimensions for halal restaurants However, interaction quality and expertise quality were not associated with satisfaction The results may indicate that consumers did not prefer human interactions at the restaurants because of the risk of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) The results affirmed that customers who positively evaluated their restaurant experience showed a higher intention to visit again Finally, the findings showed a moderating effect of the location (the capital city vs others) The customers visiting restaurants in the capital city were likely to be satisfied with employees wearing masks and wearing clean uniforms These findings could enrich the literature on the multidimensional aspects of service encounters at Uzbekistani halal restaurants considering the tangible and intangible service qualities of employees during COVID-19","output":"Employee Service Quality at Uzbekistani Halal Restaurants Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed the duration of infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant by the viral culture of respiratory samples collected daily from isolated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: 74 patients with advanced GCA treated in the oncology department of Weifang People's Hospital (January 2019CJanuary 2020) were enrolled in this study and equally split into study group (SG) and reference group (RG) according to the odd and even admission numbers. RG underwent chemotherapy alone, while SG received apatinib combined with chemotherapy. The clinical indicators of serum matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), serum interleukin-2 receptor (SIL-2R), and immune cell level were detected in the two groups before and after treatment to analyze the therapeutic effect of different treatment methods on patients with advanced gastric carcinoma. RESULTS: No obvious differences in gender ratio, average age, average BMI, pathological staging, pathological types, organ metastasis types, and residence were observed between the two groups (P > 0.05). The short-term follow-up results showed that the disease control rate (DCR) in SG was markedly higher compared with RG (P < 0.05). The MMP-9 and SIL-2R levels in both groups after treatment decreased (P < 0.05), and the levels in SG after treatment were notably lower compared with RG (P < 0.001). Compared with RG, CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD4(+)/CD8(+) levels in SG after treatment were notably higher (P < 0.001), while the CD8(+) level was notably lower (P < 0.001). The median progression-free survival (MPFS) and overall survival (OS) in SG were markedly higher compared with RG (P < 0.001). The GQOLI-74 scores in both groups after treatment increased (P < 0.001), and the GQOLI-74 score in SG after treatment was markedly higher compared with RG (P < 0.001).

There is compelling evidence that the microbiota at these sites may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this chronic airway disease. The appearance of bacteria early in life in the gut before dissemination to the airways plays a pivotal role in shaping mucosal immunity. Loss of microbial diversity or dysbiosis can result in aberrant immune-mediated inflammation and mucosal barrier disruption, which coincides clinically with the successive development of the allergic march in asthma. Microbial manipulation may be effective in curbing asthma development by indirectly preserving homeostatic epithelial barrier functions. The protective effects and mechanisms of immunity-microbiome crosstalk at mucosal sites require further investigation to identify therapeutic and preventive measures in asthma. This topical review aims to highlight new evidence that compromised epithelial barrier function, which results in deregulated crosstalk between the microbiome and host mucosal immune system, is an important disease mechanism in asthma. In the light of current COVID-19 pandemic, the collective findings on the impact of mucosal microbiota on the suceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 is explored.

A meta-analysis was conducted utilizing QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to examine the link between severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the modulation of APP expression upon virus binding the Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. A Core Analysis was run on the infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus node, which included molecules affected by SARS-CoV-2, revealing its upstream regulators. Intermediary molecules were found between the upstream regulators and ACE2 and between ACE2 and APP. Activation of the upstream regulators downregulated the expression of ACE2 with a Z-score of ?1.719 (p-value = 0.086) and upregulated APP with a Z-score of 1.898 (p-value = 0.058), showing a less than 10% chance of the results occurring by chance and pointing to an inverse relationship between ACE2 and APP expression.

The determinant for such variation remains poorly understood. This study documented the activity of influenza over a 10-year period in Hong Kong; examining its association with changes in temperature and relative humidity. The two types of influenza exhibited different correlations with meteorological variations. Influenza A showed two seasonal peaks occurring respectively in winter/spring and summer months in most years. Influenza B showed a clear winter/spring peak, but its activity during summer months was more variable. Cold and humid conditions were associated with a higher activity of both influenza A and B. In contrast, hot and humid conditions were associated with a higher activity of influenza A, but were associated with only a moderate, less consistent increase in the activity of influenza B. A trend of increase in the magnitude of summer peaks of influenza A, but not influenza B, was observed. A hypothetical 2 degrees C rise in temperature would decrease the proportion of favorable days for influenza A in December-April from 78% to 57%, but an increase from 58% to 71% in May-November; with a similar effect (from 83% to 62%) for influenza B during December-April, but a modest change (from 17% to 18%) during May-November.

Analysis of these samples can be employed for noninvasive surveillance of infectious diseases. ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy of environmental surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for predicting COVID-19 cases in a college dormitory. DesignUsing a prospective experimental design, air, surface swabs, and wastewater samples were collected from a college dormitory from March to May 2021. Students were randomly screened for COVID-19 during the study period. SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples was concentrated with electronegative filtration and quantified using Volcano 2nd Generation-qPCR. Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine the associations between time-lagged SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases. SettingThis study was conducted in a residential dormitory at the University of Miami, Coral Gables campus, FL, USA. The dormitory housed about 500 students. ParticipantsStudents from the dormitory were randomly screened, for COVID-19 for 2-3 days / week while entering or exiting the dormitory. Main OutcomeClinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases were of our main interest. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 detection in environmental samples was an indicator of the presence of local COVID-19 cases in the dormitory, and SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the environmental samples several days prior to the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. ResultsSARS-CoV-2 genomic footprints were detected in air, surface swab and wastewater samples on 52 (63.4%), 40 (50.0%) and 57 (68.6%) days, respectively, during the study period. On 19 (24%) of 78 days SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all three sample types. Clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases were reported on 11 days during the study period and SARS-CoV-2 was also detected two days before the case diagnosis on all 11 (100%), 9 (81.8%) and 8 (72.7%) days in air, surface swab and wastewater samples, respectively.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow effective is environmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in public places for early detection of COVID-19 cases in a community? FindingsAll clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases were predicted with the aid of 2 day lagged SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples in a college dormitory. However, the prediction efficiency varied by sample type: best prediction by air samples, followed by wastewater and surface swab samples. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected in these samples even on days without any reported cases of COVID-19, suggesting underreporting of COVID-19 cases. MeaningSARS-CoV-2 can be detected in environmental samples several days prior to clinical reporting of COVID-19 cases. Thus, proactive environmental surveillance of microbiome in public places can serve as a mean for early detection of location-time specific outbreaks of infectious diseases. It can also be used for underreporting of infectious diseases.","output":"COVID-19 Prediction using Genomic Footprint of SARS-CoV-2 in Air, Surface Swab and Wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current paper attempts to afford an evidence-based background on the prevalence, benefits, cons, challenges, and importance of online student assessment at higher educational level.

Although mass vaccination campaigns are commonly conducted to reach these children their effectiveness is unclear. We evaluated the effectiveness of a mass vaccination campaign in reaching zero-dose children. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in 10 health centre catchment areas in Southern province, Zambia in November 2020. About 2 months before a national mass measles and rubella vaccination campaign conducted by the Ministry of Health, we used aerial satellite maps to identify built structures. These structures were visited and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and measles zero-dose children were identified (children who had not received any DTP or measles-containing vaccines, respectively). After the campaign, households where measles zero-dose children were previously identified were targeted for mop-up vaccination and to assess if these children were vaccinated during the campaign. A Bayesian geospatial model was used to identify factors associated with zero-dose status and measles zero-dose children being reached during the campaign. We also produced fine-scale zero-dose prevalence maps and identified optimal locations for additional vaccination sites. RESULTS: Before the vaccination campaign, 17.3% of children under 9 months were DTP zero-dose and 4.3% of children 9C60 months were measles zero-dose. Of the 461 measles zero-dose children identified before the vaccination campaign, 338 (73.3%) were vaccinated during the campaign and 118 (25.6%) were reached by a targeted mop-up activity. The presence of other children in the household, younger age, greater travel time to health facilities and living between health facility catchment areas were associated with zero-dose status. Mapping zero-dose prevalence revealed substantial heterogeneity within and between catchment areas. Several potential locations were identified for additional vaccination sites. CONCLUSION: Fine-scale variation in zero-dose prevalence and the impact of accessibility to healthcare facilities on vaccination coverage were identified.

Chemotherapy use and ICU admission shortly before death were relatively infrequent in the Netherlands. Chemotherapy was used less often in hospitals that treat many patients compared to hospitals that treat fewer patients. In patients that received chemotherapy before their final three months before death, chemotherapy was prescribed four times more often in the last three months before death compared to patients without previous chemotherapy use. ABSTRACT: Since intensive care unit (ICU) admission and chemotherapy use near death impair the quality of life, we studied the prevalence of both and their correlation with hospital volume in incurable gastroesophageal cancer patients as both impair the quality of life. We analyzed all Dutch patients with incurable gastroesophageal cancer who died in 2017C2018. National insurance claims data were used to determine the prevalence of ICU admission and chemotherapy use (stratified on previous chemotherapy treatment) at three and one month(s) before death. We calculated correlations between hospital volume (i.e., the number of included patients per hospital) and both outcomes. We included 3748 patients (mean age: 71.4 years; 71.4% male). The prevalence of ICU admission and chemotherapy use were, respectively, 5.6% and 21.2% at three months and 4.2% and 8.0% at one month before death. Chemotherapy use at three and one months before death was, respectively, 4.3 times (48.0% vs. 11.2%) and 3.7 times higher (15.7% vs. 4.3%), comparing patients with previous chemotherapy treatment to those without. Hospital volume was negatively correlated with chemotherapy use in the final month (r(weighted) = ?0.23, p = 0.04). ICU admission and chemotherapy use were relatively infrequent.

This leads to morbidity and mortality, infection control challenges and the risk of evolution of novel viral variants. Optimal treatment for chronic COVID-19 is unknown. Objective To characterise a cohort of patients with chronic or relapsing COVID-19 disease and to record treatment response. Methods We conducted a UK physician survey to collect data on underlying diagnosis and demographics, clinical features and treatment response of immune deficient patients with chronic (at least 21 days) or relapsing (at least two episodes) of COVID-19. Results We identified 31 cases with a median age of 49 years. Underlying immune deficiency was characterised by antibody deficiency with absent or profoundly reduced peripheral B cells; prior anti-CD20 therapy and X-linked agammaglobulinemia were most common. Clinical features of COVID-19 were similar to the general population, but the median duration of symptomatic disease was 64 days (maximum 300 days) and individual patients experienced up to five episodes of illness. Remdesivir monotherapy (including when given for prolonged courses up to 20 days) was associated with sustained viral clearance in 7/23 (30.4%) clinical episodes whereas the combination of remdesivir with convalescent plasma or anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies resulted in viral clearance in 13/14 (92.8%) episodes. Patients receiving no therapy did not clear SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions COVID-19 can present as a chronic or relapsing disease in patients with antibody deficiency.

Simultaneously, zoological gardens have undergone a revolution in philosophy and design, resulting in a proliferation of naturalistic habitats. Complex environments such as these have been found to affect the behavior of captive animals favorably, including increasing reproductive and rearing success, encouraging the expression of species\\\\typical behavior patterns, and decreasing abnormal behaviors. In June 1988, Zoo Atlanta completed four naturalistic habitats for western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). These new habitats afforded a unique opportunity to study the adaptation of lowland gorillas to novel, naturalistic habitats. During the first year of habitation, a total of 451 hours of data were collected on 11 gorillas housed in three harem groups. Focal animal sampling with a behavioral change scoring system was used to obtain information on behavior, substrate, environmental components utilized, and location in sun or shade. Instantaneous scans at 15 minute intervals provided information on location and behavior of all individuals. Adaptation to the environments was assessed by using the indices of: time spent manipulating objects across the course of the study, the percent of the habitats utilized, and the dispersal of individual animals over the habitats. Trends in these behaviors indicated that exploration of the environments significantly decreased, but that this decline in exploration took over six months to occur.

The objective of this study was to compare the short-term virological efficacy of oseltamivir-zanamivir combination versus each monotherapy plus placebo. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial with 145 general practitioners throughout France during the 2008C2009 seasonal influenza epidemic. Patients, general practitioners, and outcome assessors were all blinded to treatment assignment. Adult outpatients presenting influenza-like illness for less than 36 hours and a positive influenza A rapid test diagnosis were randomized to oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily plus zanamivir 10 mg by inhalation twice daily (OZ), oseltamivir plus inhaled placebo (O), or zanamivir plus oral placebo (Z). Treatment efficacy was assessed virologically according to the proportion of patients with nasal influenza reverse transcription (RT)-PCR below 200 copies genome equivalent (cgeq)/l at day 2 (primary outcome), and clinically to the time to alleviation of symptoms until day 14. Overall 541 patients (of the 900 planned) were included (OZ, n = 192; O, n = 176; Z, n = 173), 49% male, mean age 39 years. In the intention-to-treat analysis conducted in the 447 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A, 46%, 59%, and 34% in OZ (n = 157), O (n = 141), and Z (n = 149) arms had RT-PCR<200 cgeq/l (?13.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] ?23.1 to ?2.9, p = 0.025; +12.3%, 95% CI 2.39C22.2, p = 0.028 for OZ/O and OZ/Z comparisons). Mean day 0 to day 2 viral load decrease was 2.14, 2.49, and 1.68 log(10) cgeq/l (p = 0.060, p = 0.016 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Median time to alleviation of symptoms was 4.0, 3.0, and 4.0 days (+1.0, 95% CI 0.0C4.0, p = 0.018; +0.0, 95% CI ?3.0 to 3.0, p = 0.960 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Four severe adverse events were observed. Nausea and/or vomiting tended to be more frequent in the combination arm (OZ, n = 13; O, n = 4; and Z, n = 5 patients, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In adults with seasonal influenza A mainly H3N2 virus infection, the oseltamivir-zanamivir combination appeared less effective than oseltamivir monotherapy, and not significantly more effective than zanamivir monotherapy.

Objective: To determine the frequencies of admission thrombocytopenia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and presence of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies in patients diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a descriptive analysis of a retrospective sample of consecutive patients diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis between January 1987 and March 2018 from 7 hospitals participating in the International Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis Consortium from Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Mexico, Iran, and Costa Rica. Of 952 patients, 865 with available baseline platelet count were included. In a subset of 93 patients, frozen plasma samples collected during a previous study between September 2009 and February 2016 were analyzed for the presence of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies. Exposures: Diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequencies of admission thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 103/L), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (as diagnosed by the treating physician), and platelet factor 4/heparin IgG antibodies (optical density >0.4, in a subset of patients with previously collected plasma samples).

Kaempferol (Kae) has been well-documented to have pharmacological activities in the previous studies. However, the detailed mechanisms by which Kae regulates inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) remain unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to measure expression levels of circNOL12, nucleolar protein 12 (NOL12), miR-6873-3p, and Fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) in HUVECs treated with either oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) alone or in combination with Kae. The cells viability was assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazol-3-ium bromide (MTT) assay. The inflammation and oxidative stress were assessed by checking inflammatory factors, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. The apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometry assay. The western blot assay was used for measuring protein expression. The interaction relationship between miR-6873-3p and circNOL12 or FRS2 was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. Treatment with Kae could inhibit ox-LDL-induced the upregulation of circNOL12 in HUVECs. Importantly, Kae weakened ox-LDL-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in HUVECs, which was abolished by overexpression of circNOL12. What's more, miR-6873-3p was a target of circNOL12 in HUVECs, and the upregulation of miR-6873-3p overturned circNOL12 overexpression-induced effects on HUVECs treated with ox-LDL and Kae.

We aimed to use real-world data from an electronic health record repository to identify treatment opportunities in US hospitals for GNIs resistant to all first-line drugs. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, population estimates with an unmet need for novel Gram-negative antibiotics were quantified using the Cerner Health Facts database (2009C15), aggregating episodes of infection in US hospitals with pathogens displaying difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR; resistance to carbapenems, other -lactams, and fluoroquinolones) and episodes involving empirical coverage with reserve drugs (colistin or polymyxin B and aminoglycosides). Episodes displaying extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance (ECR) were also estimated. Episodes were multiplied by site-specific and fixed 14-day treatment durations for conservative and liberal days-of-therapy (DOT) estimates and stratified by site and taxon. Hospital type-specific DOT rates were reliability adjusted to account for random variation; cluster analyses quantified contribution from outbreaks. FINDINGS: Across 2 996 271 inpatient encounters and 134 hospitals, there were 1352 DTR-GNI episodes, 1765 episodes involving empirical therapy with colistin or polymyxin B, and 16 632 episodes involving aminoglycosides. Collectively, these yielded 390 (conservative estimate) to 1382 (liberal estimate) DOT per 10 000 encounters for a novel DTR-GNI-targeted drug, whereas greater treatment opportunities were identified for ECR (six times greater) and -lactam susceptible GNIs (70 times greater). The most common DTR-GNI site and pathogen was lower respiratory (143 [433%] of 33 DOT per 10 000 encounters) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (522 [381%] of 1371 episodes), whereas Enterobacteriaceae urinary-tract infections dominated the ECR or carbapenem-sparing niche (590% [5589 of 9535 episodes]) equating to 2107 DOT per 10 000 encounters. DTR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia spp, and Achromobacter spp represented less than 1 DOT per 10 000 encounters each. The estimated need for DTR-GNI-targeted antibiotics saw minor contributions by outbreaks and varied from 05 to 731 DOT per 10 000 encounters by hospital type. INTERPRETATION: Suspected or documented GNIs with no or suboptimal treatment options are relatively infrequent. Non-revenue-based strategies and innovative trial designs are probably essential to the development of antibiotics with improved effectiveness for these GNIs.

Thus, the optimal target PaO(2) for patients recovering from cardiac arrest (CA) has been extensively examined. Many patients develop hypoxic brain injury after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); this supports the need for oxygen administration in patients after CA. Insufficient oxygen delivery due to decreased blood flow to cerebral tissue during CA results in hypoxic brain injury. By contrast, hyperoxia may increase dissolved oxygen in the blood and, subsequently, generate reactive oxygen species that are harmful to neuronal cells. This secondary brain injury is particularly concerning. Although several clinical studies demonstrated that hyperoxia during post-CA care was associated with poor neurological outcomes, considerable debate is ongoing because of inconsistent results. Potential reasons for the conflicting results include differences in the definition of hyperoxia, the timing of exposure to hyperoxia, and PaO(2) values used in analyses.

Methods with rapid and accurate detection are essential to control the sources of infection, to prevent the spread of the disease and to assist decision-making by public health managers. Currently, there is a wide variety of tests available with different detection methodologies, levels of specificity and sensitivity, detection time, and with an extensive range of prices. This review therefore aimed to conduct a patent search in relation to tests for the detection of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The greatest number of patents identified in the search were registered between 2003 and 2011, being mainly deposited by China, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. Most of the patents used the existing RT-PCR, ELISA, and isothermal amplification methods to develop simple, sensitive, precise, easy to use, low-cost tests that reduced false-negative or false-positive results. The findings of this patent search show that an increasing number of materials and diagnostic tests for the coronavirus are being produced to identify infected individuals and combat the growth of the current pandemic; however, there is still a question in relation to the reliability of the results of these tests.","output":"Trends in MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Diagnosis Strategies: A Patent Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 lockdown of spring 2020, Dutch children were being homeschooled.

Through Design, it is possible to map these experiences and represent them through User Journeys, allowing clear representations of how the experience took place when facing the fear of contagion, the sudden change of routine, and isolation. This study focuses on discussing the effectiveness of unifying different experiences in a single representation, mainly to outline emotional aspects. Trying to balance all emotional variations in a single User Journey prevents the researcher from seeing important details of the users' experience.

The severity of the global health burden, increasing mortality rate and the emergent economic crisis urgently demands the development of next generation vaccines. Amongst such emergent next generation vaccines are the multi-epitope subunit vaccines, which hold promise in combating deadly pathogens. In this study we have exploited immunoinformatics applications to delineate a vaccine candidate possessing multiple B and T cells epitopes by utilizing the SARS-CoV-2 non structural and structural proteins. The antigenicity potential, safety, structural stability and the production feasibility of the designed construct was evaluated computationally. Furthermore, due to the known role of human TLR-3 immune receptor in viral sensing, which facilitates host cells activation for an immune response, the vaccine construct was examined for its binding efficiency using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, which resulted in strong and stable interactions. Finally, the immune simulation studies suggested an effective immune response on vaccine administration. Overall, the immunoinformatics analysis advocates that the proposed vaccine candidate is safe and immunogenic and therefore can be pushed as a lead for in vitro and in vivo investigations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

METHODS Totally, 120 patients with chronic atrophic gastritis admitted to our hospital from February 2019 to February 2020 were enrolled and randomized into a control group (n=60) treated with Weifuchun tablets, and a experimental group given Weisu granules. Serum G-17, PG I, and PG II levels, inflammatory factor levels, TCM syndrome scores, gastric mucosa pathological scores, and clinical efficacy were compared between the two groups. Gastric tissue changes were observed using gastroscopy and HE staining. RESULTS After treatment, the levels of serum G-17, PG I, and PG II of the experimental group were significantly better than those of the control group (P<0.001). The levels of inflammatory factors, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome scores, and gastric mucosal pathology scores of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.001). The overall response rate of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). The experimental group showed a lower HP positive result and a higher HP negative conversion ratio than the control group (all P<0.05). HE staining results revealed that after treatment, the number of glands was basically restored to the level of normal gastric mucosa, and the improvement of inflammatory cell infiltration in the experimental group was significantly better than that in the control group. CONCLUSION Weisu granule combined with Weifuchun tablets can ameliorate serum G-17, PG I, and PG II levels in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis, relieve inflammatory responses and clinical symptoms, and improve the treatment effect, which is worth promoting in clinical practice.

Lockdown and risks of exposure to the coronavirus induced patients to modify their ways of use. The objective of this article was to share feedback on the implementation of a real-time monitoring system concerning (a) the activity of private practitioners in southeastern France, and (b) the evolution of reimbursements for drugs prescribed to persons with diabetes, for treatment of mental health disorders, and for performance of some vaccines. METHODS: Data regarding 2019 and 2020 were extracted from regional health insurance databases. They were used to elaborate several indicators relative to the general health insurance scheme, which were calculated and updated each week, starting with week 2. RESULTS: We observed a drop in private physician activity during the lockdown (-23% for general practitioners; -46% for specialist doctors), followed by a return to a semblance of normalcy. Concomitantly, a boom in teleconsultations occurred: at the height of the crisis they represented 30% of medical acts. The initial stage of the lockdown was characterized by peak provisioning for drugs, whereas vaccination strongly declined (-39% regarding measles, mumps and rubella vaccine among children aged less than 5 years; -54% regarding human papillomavirus vaccine among girls aged 10 to 14 years). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to health effects other than those directly attributable to the coronavirus itself. Renouncing care may result in healthcare delays highly deleterious for people and society. Public authorities are preoccupied with these questions; they have set up action plans aimed at encouraging patients to seek treatment without delay.

Studies distinguishing post-COVID conditions from late conditions caused by other etiologies are lacking. Using data from a large administrative all-payer database, we assessed the type, association, and timing of post-COVID conditions following COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) (release date, October 20, 2020) data, during March-June 2020, 27,589 inpatients and 46,857 outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 (case-patients) were 1:1 matched with patients without COVID-19 through the 4-month follow-up period (control-patients) by using propensity score matching. In this matched-cohort study, adjusted odds ratios were calculated to assess for late conditions that were more common in case-patients compared with control-patients. Incidence proportion was calculated for conditions that were more common in case-patients than control-patients during 31-120 days following a COVID-19 encounter. RESULTS: During 31-120 days after an initial COVID-19 inpatient hospitalization, 7.0% of adults experienced at least one of five post-COVID conditions. Among adult outpatients with COVID-19, 7.7% experienced at least one of ten post-COVID conditions. During 31-60 days after an initial outpatient encounter, adults with COVID-19 were 2.8 times as likely to experience acute pulmonary embolism as outpatient control-patients and were also more likely to experience a range of conditions affecting multiple body systems (e.g. nonspecific chest pain, fatigue, headache, and respiratory, nervous, circulatory, and gastrointestinal system symptoms) than outpatient control-patients. Children with COVID-19 were not more likely to experience late conditions than children without COVID-19.

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the psychological issues such as depression, anxiety and stress and the level of resilience among PG HSSs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional online survey was conducted by the department of Psychiatry of tertiary health care center from Maharashtra state of India over a 10 days period (from April 15, 2020 to April 24, 2020), with a sample size of 195 which was calculated by using the formula of sample size calculation for the cross-sectional study design. Data were collected using the purposive sampling method from the PG HSSs. Data were recorded from the study participants in an online structured questionnaire prepared for the study using the sociodemographic details and the two scales namely Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 item (DASS-21) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). DASS-21 scale was used to assess the presence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress, while BRS scale was used to assess the level of resilience among the PG HSSs. Data were collected and analyzed using the SPSS software version 15.0, Fisher's exact test, and Pearson's correlation test. Results: Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress were 43.1%, 68.7%, and 11.3%, respectively. There was a high positive correlation between all three subscales of DASS-21 (depression, anxiety, and stress subscales).

Thus, it is essential to have reliable ways to classify and analyze new instances of PIPs. Machine learning (ML) models have been widely employed for the classification of biological sequences, being the basis for most studies in extensive databases of biological information. Most ML algorithms have difficulty to directly deal with these sequences. Thereby, relevant features are extracted from these sequences, making feature extraction one of the key steps in the application of ML algorithms to biological data. Different features have been proposed, many of them based on prior knowledge, such as molecular structures. However, many biological sequences publicly available do not come with prior knowledge. To deal with this limitation, we propose to investigate the use of mathematical descriptors to extract features from PIP sequences. To assess how relevant are the features extracted using mathematical descriptors, we run experiments where we apply three ML algorithms. In these experiments, we obtained a predictive accuracy of 0.7034, which is on par with current PIP classifiers. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"MathPIP: Classification of Proinflammatory Peptides Using Mathematical Descriptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing global pandemic of Covid-19 has exposed SARS-CoV-2 as a potent nonhuman actant that resists the joint scientific, public health and socio-political efforts to contain and understand both the virus and the illness Yet, such a narrative appears to conceal more than it reveals The seeming agentiality of the novel coronavirus is itself but one manifestation of the continuous destruction of biodiversity, climate change, socio-economic inequalities, neocolonialism, overconsumption and the anthropogenic degradation of nature Furthermore, focusing on the virus - an entity that holds an ambiguous status between the living and ?on-living - brings into question the issue of the agentiality of non/living matter While the story of viral potency seems to get centre stage, overshadowing the complex and perverse entanglement of processes and phenomena which activated these potentials in the first place, the Covid-19 pandemic also becomes a prism that sheds light on the issues of environmental violence;social and environmental injustices;more-than-human agentiality;and ethico-political responses that the present situation may mobilise This article serves as a written record of joint conversations between artists and researchers in the working group Non/Living Queerings that formed part of the online series of events Braiding Friction organised by the research project Biofriction The article strives to capture the collective effort of braiding and weaving a variety of situated perspectives, theoretical toolboxes, knowledges and experiences against the background of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic In particular, the text focuses on the issues of crisis, amplification effect, viral agency and the changing notions of humanity ? 2021, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya All rights reserved","output":"Non/living queerings, undoing certainties, and braiding vulnerabilities: A collective reflection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to discover the risk index of the spread of coronavirus COVID-19 in Algeria, in particular with the procedures of partial deconfinement and its consequences which can be dangerous Therefore, it is necessary to focus on objective statistical index to allow building effective knowledge and practices in the post-Coronavirus phase with more caution and prevention By using this index, countries can know the ideal moment to go towards deconfinement","output":"Gravity index of the covid-19 pandemic in the first deconfinement phase in Algeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an easy to use, portable tool, but the accuracy of the technique in infants and young children (<24 months) remains unclear.

But intuitive theories can also contain and reinforce dangerous misconceptions. In this paper, we take up the case of misconceptions about vaccine safety that discourage vaccination. These misconceptions constitute a major public health risk that predates the coronavirus pandemic but that has become all the more dire in recent years. We argue that addressing such misconceptions requires awareness of the broader conceptual contexts in which they are embedded. To build this understanding, we examined the structure and revision of peoples intuitive theories of vaccination in five large survey studies (total N = 3196). Based on these data, we present a cognitive model of the intuitive theory surrounding peoples decisions about whether to vaccinate young children against diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). Using this model, we were able to make accurate predictions about how peoples beliefs would be revised in light of educational interventions, design an effective new intervention encouraging vaccination, and understand how these beliefs were affected by real-world events (the measles outbreaks of 2019). In addition to presenting a promising way forward for promoting the MMR vaccine, this approach has clear implications for encouraging the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, especially among parents of young children.

However, little is known regarding this hesitancy as well as regional differences that may exist between parents from Shandong vs. Zhejiang. Methods: To assess these issues, an online survey was conducted via a Wenjuanxing platform over the period from July 22 to August 14, 2021. Parents from Shandong and Zhejiang were recruited from Wechat groups and results from a total of 917 subjects were analyzed. Factors evaluated in this survey included socio-demographic variables, parental vaccine hesitancy, Parental Attitudes toward Childhood Vaccines (PACV) domains (behavior, safety and efficacy, general attitudes) and social support. Results: Compared with those from Shandong (N = 443), parents from Zhejiang (N = 474) showed significantly higher prevalence rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (19.4 vs. 11.7%, p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that yearly household incomes of 120,000 RMB (p = 0.041), medical workers (p = 0.022) and general attitudes of PACV (p = 0.004) were risk factors for vaccine hesitancy among parents from Shandong, while behavior (p = 0.004), safety and efficacy (p < 0.001) and general attitudes of PACV (p = 0.002) were risk factors for parents from Zhejiang. Among parents with vaccine hesitancy (N = 144), concerns over side effects (91.0%) and unknown effects (84.0%) of the COVID-19 vaccine were the most prevalent reasons for hesitancy. Evidence providing proof of vaccine safety (67.4%) and assurance of a low risk of being infected by COVID-19 (60.4%) were the two most effective persuasive factors. Conclusion: Parents from Zhejiang showed a higher prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy as compared with those from Shandong. Behavior, safety and efficacy, and general attitudes of PACV were the risk factors associated with this hesitancy in these parents from Zhejiang. Given the identification of the various reasons for parental vaccine hesitancy, different strategies as well as regional adjustments in these strategies will be required for an effective and convincing protocol for childhood vaccinations.","output":"A Cross-Sectional Survey on COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Parents From Shandong vs. Zhejiang"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]as organizations begin to rely on a much broader range of global personnel (Reiche et al., 2019;Shaffer et al., 2012) to tap into opportunities that can yield new organizational learning and other positive outcomes, a vast range of global work categories emerged.

The COVID-19 epidemic catalyzed the expansion of online health care services. In recent years, internet hospitals have been rapidly developed. Ping An Good Doctor is the largest, national online medical entry point in China and is a widely used platform providing online health care services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to give a comprehensive description of the characteristics of the online consultations and inquisitions in Ping An Good Doctor. The analyses tried to answer the following questions: (1) What are the characteristics of the consultations in Ping An Good Doctor in terms of department and disease profiles? (2) Who uses the online health services most frequently? and (3) How is the user experience of the online consultations of Ping An Good Doctor? METHODS: A total of 35.3 million consultations and inquisitions over the course of 1 year were analyzed with respect to the distributions of departments and diseases, user profiles, and consulting behaviors. RESULTS: The geographical distribution of the usage of Ping An Good Doctor showed that Shandong (18.4%), Yunnan (15.6%), Shaanxi (7.2%), and Guangdong (5.5%) were the provinces that used it the most; they accounted for 46.6% of the total consultations and inquisitions. In terms of department distribution, we found that gynecology and obstetrics (19.2%), dermatology (17.0%), and pediatrics (14.4%) were the top three departments in Ping An Good Doctor. The disease distribution analysis showed that, except for nondisease-specific consultations, acute upper respiratory infection (AURI) (4.1%), pregnancy (2.8%), and dermatitis (2.4%) were the most frequently consulted diseases. In terms of user profiles, females (60.4%) from 19 to 35 years of age were most likely to seek consultations online, in general. The user behavior analyses showed that the peak times of day for online consultations occurred at 10 AM, 3 PM, and 9 PM. Regarding user experience, 93.0% of users gave full marks following their consultations. For some disease-related health problems, such as AURI, dermatitis, and eczema, the feedback scores were above average. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of internet hospitals, such as Ping An Good Doctor, illustrated the great demand for online health care services that can go beyond geographical limitations. Our analyses showed that nondisease-specific issues and moderate health problems were much more frequently consulted about than severe clinical conditions. This indicated that internet hospitals played the role of the family doctor, which helped to relieve the stress placed on offline hospitals and facilitated people's lives. In addition, good user experiences, especially regarding disease-related inquisitions, suggested that online health services can help solve health problems. With support from the government and acceptance by the public, online health care services could develop at a fast pace and greatly benefit people's daily lives.","output":"Characteristics of Online Health Care Services From China's Largest Online Medical Platform: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging market multinational enterprises (EMNEs) play a vital role in global economic development and usually adopt aggressive internationalization strategies. However, the volatile global environment has caused EMNEs to face various risks in their overseas expansion. To maximize the competitive advantages and achieve successful expansion, EMNEs should choose the most suitable foreign entry mode. Therefore, EMNEs need to understand what environmental factors affect their decision-making and how they influence the choice of entry modes, especially in a volatile environment. This review examines 44 selected journal articles from 1996 to June 2021 on the environmental volatility determinants of EMNEs entry mode choice. The entry mode choice we examined is mainly wholly-owned subsidiary versus international joint venture. We categorized the environmental volatility determinants investigated in the literature we reviewed into country-level factors (such as cross-national distance) and industry-level factors (such as industry condition).

Interventions to stem overdose benefit from contextual understandings of communities' needs and strengths in addressing the opioid crisis. This project aims to understand multiple stakeholder perspectives on the opioid epidemic in communities disproportionately affected by opioid-involved overdose mortality. Methods: We performed a rapid-cycle qualitative assessment study utilizing in-depth interviews with community stakeholders and observations of community meetings in eight communities in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, USA, disproportionately impacted by opioid-involved overdose mortality. Stakeholder categories included: current and past illicit users of opioids; medical and social service providers; emergency medical services; law enforcement; spouse or other family members of illicit users/former users of opioids; government officials; school officials; community members. Content analysis was utilized to identify themes and answer study questions. Regular feedback to stakeholders was provided to support targeted interventions. Results: We performed semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 130 community stakeholders and 29 community meeting observations in 2018-2019. Participants perceived similar economic and social determinants as origins of the opioid overdose epidemic including lack of economic resources, loss of jobs, transient populations and dilapidated housing. However, they differed in their awareness of and attention to the epidemic. Awareness was dependent on the visibility of opioid use (presence of paraphernalia litter, location of drug users, media coverage, and relationship to users). Overall, there was good knowledge of naloxone for opioid overdose reversal but less knowledge about local syringe services programs. Perceptions of harm reduction efforts were ambivalent. Conclusions: Members of communities impacted by the opioid epidemic perceived that economic downturn was a major factor in the opioid overdose epidemic. However, the varied beliefs within and between communities suggest that interventions need to be tailored according to the cultural norms of place.","output":"A rapid-cycle assessment strategy for understanding the opioid overdose epidemic in local communities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inductive datatypes in programming languages allow users to define useful data structures such as natural numbers, lists, trees, and others.

However, the kinetics of B*13-restricted T-cell responses, viral evolution within epitopes, and the impact on disease progression in CRF01_AE subtype HIV-1-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) are not known. RESULTS: Interferon- ELISPOT assays and deep sequencing of viral RNAs were done in 14 early HLA-B*13-positive CRF01_AE subtype HIV-1-infected MSM. We found that responses to RQEILDLWV (Nef(106C114), RV9), GQMREPRGSDI (Gag(226C236), GI11), GQDQWTYQI (Pol(487C498), GI9), and VQNAQGQMV (Gag(135C143), VV9) were dominant. A higher relative magnitude of Gag-specific T-cell responses, contributed to viral control, whereas Nef-specific T-cell responses were associated with rapid disease progression. GI11 (Gag) was conserved and strong GI11 (Gag)-specific T-cell responses showed cross-reactivity with a dominant variant, M228I, found in 3/12 patients; GI11 (Gag)-specific T-cell responses were positively associated with CD4 T-cell counts (R = 0.716, P = 0.046). Interestingly, the GI9 (Pol) epitope was also conserved, but GI9 (Pol)-specific T-cell responses did not influence disease progression (P > 0.05), while a D490G variant identified in one patient did not affect CD4 T-cell counts. All the other epitopes studied [VV9 (Gag), RQYDQILIEI (Pol(113C122), RI10), HQSLSPRTL (Gag(144C152), HL9), and RQANFLGRL (Gag(429C437,) RL9)] developed escape mutations within 1 year of infection, which may have contributed to overall disease progression. Intriguingly, we found early RV9 (Nef)-specific T-cell responses were associated with rapid disease progression, likely due to escape mutations.

Ground monitoring data is compared with satellite images and mobility indicators. The study shows a drastic decrease during lockdown in the concentration of the gaseous pollutants analysed (NO2, SO2, CO, and C6H6) that aligns with the results reported in other international cities and metropolitan areas. However, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) averaged concentrations followed a markedly different trend from the gaseous pollutants, indicating a larger influence from natural events (sand and dust storms) and other anthropogenic sources.

Data on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are lacking. We assessed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated variables in patients with IBD. METHODS: We evaluated voluntary patient survey responses during routine clinical visits to our IBD center. Data collected included demographic and clinical characteristics. Descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate significant associations with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: A total of 239 individuals completed the survey. Over a third of respondents (35.6%) expressed hesitancy toward receiving the COVID-19 vaccine due to vaccine safety concerns (49.4%) and efficacy (23.5%), while others reported non-specific concerns (34.1%). On univariate analysis, Crohns disease (OR 2.33 CI 1.28C4.25 p = 0.0056), use of biologic medications (OR 1.93 CI 1.16C3.23, p = 0.012), previous self-reported vaccine refusal (OR 8.13 CI 2.90C22.82 p = 0.0001), earlier date of survey administration (OR 2.01 CI 1.17C3.44 p = 0.011), and self-reported COVID infection (OR 2.55 CI 1.16C5.61 p = 0.0056) were more likely to be associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

However, the molecular antiviral mechanisms of chickens to IBV infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted global gene expression profiling of chicken kidney tissue after nephropathogenic IBV infection to better understand the interactions between host and virus. RESULTS: IBV infection contributed to differential expression of 1777 genes, of which 876 were up-regulated and 901 down-regulated in the kidney compared to those of control chickens and 103 associated with immune and inflammatory responses may play important roles in the host defense response during IBV infection. Twelve of the altered immune-related genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Gene ontology category, KEGG pathway, and gene interaction networks (STRING analysis) were analyzed to identify relationships among differentially expressed genes involved in signal transduction, cell adhesion, immune responses, apoptosis regulation, positive regulation of the I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade and response to cytokine stimulus. Most of these genes were related and formed a large network, in which IL6, STAT1, MYD88, IRF1 and NFKB2 were key genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided comprehensive knowledge regarding the host transcriptional response to IBV infection in chicken kidney tissues, thereby providing insight into IBV pathogenesis, particularly the involvement of innate immune pathway genes associated with IBV infection.","output":"Transcriptome analysis of chicken kidney tissues following coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Young adults and especially those with pre-existing mental health conditions, such as disordered eating and self-harm, appear to be at greater risk of developing metal health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether this increased risk is affected by any changes in lockdown restrictions, and whether any lifestyle changes could moderate this increased risk. METHODS: In a longitudinal UK-based birth cohort (The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC) we assessed the relationship between pre-pandemic measures of disordered eating and self-harm and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2657 young adults. Regression models examined the relationship between self-reported disordered eating, self-harm, and both disordered eating and self-harm at age 25 years and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and mental wellbeing during a period of eased restrictions in the COVID-19 pandemic (MayCJuly 2020) when participants were aged 27C29 years. Analyses were adjusted for sex, questionnaire completion date, pre-pandemic socioeconomic disadvantage and pre-pandemic mental health and wellbeing. We also examined whether lifestyle changes (sleep, exercise, alcohol, visiting green space, eating, talking with family/friends, hobbies, relaxation) in the initial UK lockdown (AprilCMay 2020) moderated these associations. RESULTS: Pre-existing disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm were all associated with the reporting of a higher frequency of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and poorer mental wellbeing during the pandemic compared to individuals without disordered eating and self-harm. Associations remained when adjusting for pre-pandemic mental health measures. There was little evidence that interactions between disordered eating and self-harm exposures and lifestyle change moderators affected pandemic mental health and wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with pre-pandemic disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm were at increased risk for developing symptoms of depression, anxiety and poor mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, even when accounting for pre-pandemic mental health. Lifestyle changes during the pandemic do not appear to alter this risk. A greater focus on rapid and responsive service provision is essential to reduce the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of these already vulnerable individuals. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: The aim of this project was to explore the mental health of young adults with disordered eating behaviours (such as fasting, vomiting/taking laxatives, binge-eating and excessive exercise) and self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed data from an established study that has followed children from birth (in 1991 and 1992) up to present day, including during the pandemic when participants were 28 years old. We looked at the relationship between disordered eating and/or self-harm behaviours from before the pandemic and mental health problems (symptoms of depression and anxiety) and mental wellbeing during the pandemic. We also explored whether there were any lifestyle changes (such as changes in sleep, exercise, visiting green space) that might be linked to better mental health and wellbeing in young adults with disordered eating and self-harm. We found that young adults with prior disordered eating and/or self-harm had more symptoms of depression and anxiety, and worse mental wellbeing than individuals without prior disordered eating or self-harm. However, lifestyle changes did not appear to affect mental health and wellbeing in these young adults. Our findings suggest that people with a history of disordered eating and/or self-harm were at high risk for developing mental health problems during the pandemic, and they will need help from mental health services.

There have been around 22,213,869 reported cases of COVID-19 and almost 781,677 deaths worldwide according to the data updated by World Health Organization till 20 August 2020. It transmitted via droplets from an infected person to a healthy person in a very short duration of time. After the completion of the incubation period, which ranges from 2 to 14 days, the person experiences pneumonia-like symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, breathlessness, malaise, fatigue, and multi-organ dysfunction, etc. The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which binds with the spike (S) protein of the virus and helps it in attachment and entry to the host cells. COVID-19 is diagnosed by molecular testing of respiratory secretions and CT scan analysis.

The pooled incidence rates of clinical features were estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation method. RESULTS: The incidence rates of fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia/muscle pain, or vomiting were found to be significantly higher in influenza patients when compared with COVID-19 patients. The incidence rates of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease/hypertension and diabetes, were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared with influenza patients. In contrast, comorbidities such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and immunocompromised conditions were significantly more common in influenza compared with COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, the estimated rates of intensive care unit admission, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, treatment with antibiotics, and fatality were comparable between hospitalized COVID-19 and 2009 influenza pandemic patients.

Since the common leader is derived from the genomic 5' end during transcription, a common focus of origin for the heterogeneity is expected. The intraleader open reading frame was shown by in vitro translation studies to attenuate translation of downstream open reading frames in a cloned bovine coronavirus mRNA molecule. Selection of an intraleader open reading frame resulting in a general attenuation of mRNA translation and a consequent attenuation of virus replication may, therefore, be a mechanism by which coronaviruses and possibly other RNA viruses with a similar transcriptional strategy maintain a persistent infection.","output":"A translation-attenuating intraleader open reading frame is selected on coronavirus mRNAs during persistent infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Considering the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health service delivery, the US Office for Civil Rights (OCR) updated the policies on health data processing, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many operational changes were adopted in our ophthalmology clinic to enhance patient and provider safety while maintaining necessary clinical operations. The aim of this study was to evaluate how measures adopted during the pandemic period affected retina clinic performance and patient satisfaction, and to model future clinic flow to predict operational performance under conditions of increasing patient and provider volumes. Methods: : Timestamps were extracted from the electronic medical records of in-person retina encounters from March 15 to May 15, 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019 to assess patient flow through the clinical encounter. Patient satisfaction was evaluated by Press Ganey patient experience surveys obtained from randomly selected outpatient encounters. A discrete-events simulation was designed to model the clinic with COVID-era restrictions to assess operational performance under conditions of increasing patient and provider volumes. Results: : Retina clinic volume declined by 62% during the COVID-19 health emergency. Average check-in-to-technician time declined 79%, total visit length declined by 46%, and time in the provider phase of care declined 53%. Of note, patient satisfaction regarding access nearly doubled during the COVID-period compared with the prior year (p < 0.0001), while satisfaction with overall care and safety remained high during both periods. A model incorporating COVID-related changes demonstrated that wait time before rooming reached levels similar to the pre-COVID era by 30 patients per provider in a 1-provider model and 25 patients-per-provider in a 2-provider model (p < 0.001). Capacity to maintain distancing between patients was exceeded only in the two 2-provider model above 25 patients-per-provider.

In developing nations, this can be compounded by logistical challenges, such as vaccine shortages and poor road infrastructure. To provide guidance towards improved epidemic response, various resource allocation models, in conjunction with a network-based SEIRVD epidemic model, are proposed in this article. Further, the feasibility of using drones for vaccine delivery is evaluated, and assorted relevant parameters are discussed. For the sake of generality, these results are presented for multiple network structures, representing interconnected populationsupon which repeated epidemic simulations are performed. The resource allocation models formulated maximise expected prevented exposures on each day of a simulated epidemic, by allocating response teams and vaccine deliveries according to the solutions of two respective integer programming problemsthereby influencing the simulated epidemic through the SEIRVD model. These models, when compared with a range of alternative resource allocation strategies, were found to reduce both the number of cases per epidemic, and the number of vaccines required. Consequently, the recommendation is made that such models be used as decision support tools in epidemic response. In the absence thereof, prioritizing locations for vaccinations according to susceptible population, rather than total population or number of infections, is most effective for the majority of network types. In other results, fixed-wing drones are demonstrated to be a viable delivery method for vaccines in the context of an epidemic, if sufficient drones can be promptly procured; the detrimental effect of intervention delay was discovered to be significant. In addition, the importance of well-documented routine vaccination activities is highlighted, due to the benefits of increased pre-epidemic immunity rates, and targeted vaccination.","output":"Allocating epidemic response teams and vaccine deliveries by drone in generic network structures, according to expected prevented exposures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New ways to identify students in need of assistance are imperative to the evolution of online tutoring platforms.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of a community-based adult population to evaluate the environmental exposure and health impact of the Pohang Industrial Complex, Korea. Participants were examined based on self-reported questionnaires, nasal swab, and blood sampling. RESULTS: There were 307 participants, and the overall prevalence of SA carriage and SE IgE-sensitization was 26.1% (80/307) and 25.7% (79/307), respectively. An urban environment was significantly correlated with SA carriage, whereas age and obesity were significantly correlated with SE IgE-sensitization. SA carriage was not associated with an increase in total IgE and blood eosinophil count, whereas SE IgE-sensitization was associated with an increased total IgE and blood eosinophil count. SA carriage was significantly correlated with cough persisting for more than three weeks (OR, 3.044; 95% CI, 1.137C8.153) and sputum (OR, 2.429; 95% CI, 1.008C5.854).

We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science from database inception to July 2018. Two raters independently coded the articles for the method used to conduct the adaptation, the reason for and nature of the adaptation, and who made the adaptation. FINDINGS The search produced 20 194 citations, which yielded 152 articles after screening. The most commonly used methods for planned adaptations were literature review (57.7%), clinical intuition (47.0%) and theory (38.9%).

Methods: Virus Watch is a large community cohort with prospective daily recording of a wide range of symptoms and self-reporting of swab results (mainly undertaken through the UK TTI System). We compared frequency, severity, timing, and duration of symptoms in test positive and test negative cases. We compared the test performance of the current UK case definition used by TTI (any one of: new continuous cough, high temperature or loss of or change in sense of smell or taste) with a wider definition that also included muscle aches or chills or headache or loss of appetite. Findings: We included results from 8213 swabbed illnesses, 944 of which tested positive for COVID-19. All symptoms were more common in swab positive than swab negative illnesses and symptoms were also more severe and of longer duration. Common symptoms such as cough, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and loss of appetite occurred early in the course of illness but were also very common in test-negative illnesses. Rarer symptoms such as fever or loss or altered sense of smell or taste were often not present but were markedly more common in swab positive compared to swab negative cases. The current UK definition had a sensitivity and specificity of 81% and 47% respectively for symptomatic COVID-19 compared to 93% and 26% for the broader definition. On average cases met the broader case definition one day earlier than current definition. 1.7-fold more illnesses met the broader definition than the current case definition. Interpretation: COVID-19 is difficult to distinguish from other respiratory infections and common ailments on the basis of symptoms.

Quantities of viral fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater are related to numbers of clinical cases of COVID-19 reported within the corresponding sewershed. Variants of Concern (VOCs) have been detected in wastewater by use of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or sequencing. A multiplex RT-qPCR assay to detect and estimate the prevalence of multiple VOCs, including Omicron/Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, in wastewater RNA extracts was developed and validated. The probe-based multiplex assay, named N200, focuses on amino acids 199-202, a region of the N gene that contains several mutations that are associated with variants of SARS-CoV-2 within a single amplicon. Each of the probes in the N200 assay are specific to the targeted mutations and worked equally well in single- and multi-plex modes. To estimate prevalence of each VOC, the abundance of the targeted mutation was compared with a non-mutated region within the same amplified region. The N200 assay was applied to monitor frequencies of VOCs in wastewater extracts from six sewersheds in Ontario, Canada collected between December 1, 2021, and January 4, 2022. Using the N200 assay, the replacement of the Delta variant along with the introduction and rapid dominance of the Omicron variant were monitored in near real-time, as they occurred nearly simultaneously at all six locations. The N200 assay is robust and efficient for wastewater surveillance can be adopted into VOC monitoring programs or replace more laborious assays currently being used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 and its VOCs.","output":"Multiplex RT-qPCR assay (N200) to detect and estimate prevalence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission electron microscopy has become a valuable tool to investigate tissues of COVID-19 patients because it allows visualisation of SARS-CoV-2, but the \\"virus-like particles\\" described in several organs have been highly contested.

Using micrographs from infected cell cultures and autopsy tissues, we show how coronavirus replication affects ultrastructure and put the morphological findings in the context of viral replication, which induces extensive remodelling of the intracellular membrane systems. Virions assemble by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex and are characterized by electron dense dots of cross-sections of the nucleocapsid inside the viral particles. Physiological mimickers such as multivesicular bodies or coated vesicles serve as perfect decoys. Compared to other in-situ techniques, transmission electron microscopy is the only method to visualize assembled virions in tissues and will be required to prove SARS-CoV-2 replication outside the respiratory tract. In practice, documenting in tissues the characteristic features seen in infected cell cultures, seems to be much more difficult than anticipated.

Mesh placement for the prevention of trocar site incisional hernia (TSIH) is still a controversial issue. We tested the hypothesis that closure with an intraperitoneal prophylactic mesh of the umbilical trocar after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy can reduce the incidence of a TSIH in high-risk patients. STUDY DESIGN A randomized clinical trial was conducted among patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy who presented the following high-risk factors for incisional hernia, according to the literature: age 65 years and older, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, and obesity (ie, body mass index 30 kg/m(2)). Patients were assigned to have closure of the umbilical trocar site with either nonabsorbable sutures (group A) or intraperitoneal polypropylene omega-3 mesh (group B). Trocar site incisional hernia, pain, and surgical complications were evaluated at the early postoperative course and at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS A total of 106 patients were randomized into the study and 92 patients were finally analyzed, including 47 in group A and 45 in group B. The TSIH rate was higher in group A (31.9%) than in group B (4.4%) (odds ratio = 10.1; 95% CI, 2.15-47.6; p < 0.001)). The wound infection rate was 4.3%; 8.5% in group A and 0% in group B (odds ratio = 2.04; 95% CI, 1.7-2.5; p = 0.045). Median postoperative pain evaluated by a visual analogue scale was 3 in group A and 2 in group B (p = 0.05). No differences were observed in complication rate, operative time, or hospital stay between the groups.

METHODS: Bleomycin induced PF mice were constructed and treated with Bach1 siRNA adenovirus (BLM + Bach1 siRNA group), control siRNA adenovirus (BLM + Control siRNA group) or normal saline (BLM group), then lung tissues were collected for Bach1 expression detection, H&E staining and Masson's trichrome staining. Afterwards, collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expressions in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined. Subsequently, mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were collected from PF mice and treated with TGF-?1 to construct PF cell model, which was treated with Bach1 siRNA adenovirus (TGF-?1 + Bach1 siRNA group) and MAP kinase (ERK) inhibitor U0126 alone (TGF-?1 + U0126 group) or in combination (TGF-?1 + U0126 + Bach1 siRNA group), then alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA), fibronectin 1 (Fn1), COL1A1, IL-6 expressions and cell viability were detected. RESULTS: Lung tissue Bach1 mRNA and protein expressions were upregulated in PF mice compared to control mice. Bach1 knockdown reduced lung fibrosis (displayed by Masson's trichrome staining) and inflammation (displayed by H&E staining), then downregulated serum and BALF expressions of COL1A1 and IL-6 in PF mice. Subsequently, in PF cell model, Bach1 knockdown blocked ERK pathway, but did not affect Smads, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (Akt) pathways. Further experiments revealed that Bach1 knockdown repressed cell viability, &#945;-SMA, Fn1, IL-6 and COL1A1 expressions in PF cell model, then ERK inhibition by U0126 enhanced these effects.

Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs available that slow NASH progression or address NASH liver involvement in COVID-19. Since animal models cannot fully recapitulate human NASH, we hypothesized that stem cells isolated directly from end-stage NASH patient liver may address current knowledge gaps in human NASH pathology. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We devised methods allowing derivation, proliferation, hepatic differentiation and extensive characterization of bipotent ductal organoids from irreversibly damaged NASH patient liver. The transcriptomes of organoids derived from NASH liver, but not healthy liver show significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory and cytochrome p450-related pathways, as well as of known liver fibrosis and tumor markers, with the degree of upregulation being NASH patient-specific. Functionally, NASH liver organoids exhibit reduced passaging/growth capacity and show hallmarks of NASH liver, including decreased albumin production, increased free fatty acid induced lipid accumulation, increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli and increased CYP450 metabolism. After hepatic differentiation, NASH liver organoids exhibit reduced ability to dedifferentiate back to the biliary state, consistent with the known reduced regenerative ability of NASH livers. Intriguingly, NASH liver organoids also show strongly increased permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2-VSV pseudovirus as well as upregulation of ubiquitin D (Fat10), a known inhibitor of the antiviral interferon host response.

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of burnout among surgeons in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey was set in the UK National Health Service and involved 601 surgeons across the UK of all specialities and grades. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory and a bespoke questionnaire. Outcome measures included emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and low personal accomplishment, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS). RESULTS: A total of 142 surgeons reported having contracted COVID-19. Burnout prevalence was particularly high in the emotional exhaustion (57%) and depersonalisation (50%) domains, while lower on the low personal accomplishment domain (15%). Burnout prevalence was unrelated to COVID-19 status; however, the greater the perceived impact of COVID-19 on work, the higher the prevalence of emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation. Degree of worry about contracting COVID-19 oneself and degree of worry about family and friends contacting COVID-19 was positively associated with prevalence on all three burnout domains. Across all three domains, burnout prevalence was exceptionally high in the Core Trainee 1C2 and Specialty Trainee 1C2 grades.

Projection data consistency is regulated by dense optical flow estimated by Farneback's algorithm, leading to sharp sample reconstructions with less artifacts. Synthetic data tests show robustness of the method to Poisson and low-frequency background noise. Applicability of the method is demonstrated on two large-scale nano-imaging experimental data sets.","output":"Distributed optimization for nonrigid nano-tomography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent reports of allergic reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have resulted in questions about how and to whom they can be safely administered.

Study of asymptomatic transmission and implications for surveillance and disease burden are ongoing, but there has been little study of the implications of asymptomatic transmission on dynamics of disease. We use a mathematical framework to evaluate expected effects of asymptomatic transmission on the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, [Formula: see text] will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, [Formula: see text] will be under-estimated. Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals. Our analysis shows that understanding the temporal course of asymptomatic transmission can be important for assessing the importance of this route of transmission, and for disease dynamics. This provides an additional motivation for investigating both the importance and relative duration of asymptomatic transmission.","output":"The time scale of asymptomatic transmission affects estimates of epidemic potential in the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The indelible impacts on our nation from the Coronavirus pandemic along with high fatality rates that disproportionately burden racial and ethnic minorities necessitate long-term coordinated federal, state and local action to improve critical determinants of population health, specifically important health and public health infrastructures as well as emergency and disaster preparedness systems.

METHODS: This was a retrospective case series in which vMGII score along with virtual Single Simple Question (vSSQ), virtual Patient-Acceptable Symptom State PASS (vPASS) response, and patient disease status based on Myathenia Gravis Foundation of America postintervention status were collected during telephone consultation along with the MGII, SSQ, and PASS responses during the preceding in-person clinic visits. RESULTS: In 214 patients, the mean difference of vMGII between the vPASS \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\" groups was -14.2  1.4 (95% confidence interval, -16.9 to -11.3; P < .001) with mean vMGII for vPASS \\"Yes\\" group being 6.4  7.7 and vPASS \\"No\\" being 20.5  11.5.

Exposure to infectious droplets confers a high risk for infection transmission by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Aerosolizing procedures pose particular concern for increasing healthcare workers' (HCWs) risks of infection. Multiple creative personal protective equipment solutions have been utilized to minimize exposure to infectious particles; however, the overall benefit of many of these devices is limited by a number of factors. Methods. We designed an intubation tent consisting of a metal frame and a clear plastic sheet. The flexible walls of our tent offer increased maneuverability & access, although the efficacy in reducing risk of transmission to HCWs remained unclear. Using an atomizer, particle generator, and matchstick smoke, we simulated the generation of infectious respiratory droplets and aerosols and tested whether our device effectively decreased the concentration of these particles to which a provider might be exposed. Finally, we tested whether the addition of a vacuum fan fit with a high efficiency particulate air filter designed to evacuate contaminated air would influence particle concentrations inside and outside the tent. Results. Droplet dispersion tests with the tent in place showed that the simulated droplet distribution was limited to surfaces within the tent. Aerosol testing under a variety of circumstances consistently showed only a minor rise in particle concentration in the air outside the tent despite an initial peak of particle concentration during generation within. All testing demonstrated declining inside concentrations over time. Conclusions. Our simulations suggest our device has the potential to effectively decrease HCWs' exposure to infectious droplets and aerosolized viral particles.","output":"An Aerosol Containment and Filtration Tent for Intubation During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes (T2D), most individuals with the disease will ultimately undergo treatment intensification. This usually involves the stepwise addition of a new glucose-lowering agent or switching to a more complex insulin regimen. However, complex treatment regimens can result in an increased risk of hypoglycaemia and high treatment burden, which may impact negatively on both therapeutic adherence and overall quality of life. Individuals with good glycaemic control may also be overtreated with unnecessarily complex regimens. Treatment simplification aims to reduce individual treatment burden, without compromising therapeutic effectiveness or safety. Despite data showing that simplifying therapy can achieve good glycaemic control without negatively impacting on treatment efficacy or safety, it is not always implemented in clinical practice. Current clinical guidelines focus on treatment intensification, rather than simplification. Where simplification is recommended, clear guidance is lacking and mostly focused on treatment of the elderly. An expert, multidisciplinary panel evaluated the current treatment landscape with respect to guidance, published evidence, recommendations and approaches regarding simplification of complex insulin regimens.

The IJB-B and IJB-C databases are selected for evaluating the performance against the variation across pose, illumination and expression (PIE). The FG-Net database is selected for evaluating the performance across age. The SCface is chosen for evaluating the performance on low-resolution images. The MS-1MV2 is exploited as the base training set. We use the ResNet-100 as the feature embedding network connected to state-of-the-art loss functions designed for tackling face recognition. The loss functions considered include the Center Loss, the Marginal Loss, the Angular Softmax Loss, the Large Margin Cosine Loss and the Additive Angular Margin Loss. Both verification and identification are conducted in our evaluation. The performances for recognizing faces with and without the synthetic masks are all evaluated for a complete comparison. The network with the best loss function for recognizing synthetic masked faces is then assessed on a real masked face database, the cleaned RMFRD (c-RMFRD) dataset. Compared with a human user test on the c-RMFRD, the network trained on the synthetic masked faces outperforms human vision for a large gap. Our contributions are fourfold. The first is a comprehensive study for tackling masked face recognition by using state-of-the-art loss functions against various compounding factors.

However, little is known about suppressive biologics against SARS-CoV-2 entry factors. Here, we show that the nasal commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis altered the host transcriptional response against SARS-CoV-2 by reducing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in concert with an increase in serine protease inhibitors. Our data reveal that ACE2 was more abundantly expressed in nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells than bronchial epithelial cells, and inoculation with S. epidermidis reduced ACE2 transcription in NHNE cells. TMPRSS2 mRNA was significantly decreased in NHNE cells and S. epidermidis colony number in human nasal mucus was inversely correlated with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in nasal mucosa. In addition, levels of the serine protease inhibitors SERPINE1 and SERPINE2 were significantly increased by S. epidermidis , and this accompanied reduction of TMPRSS2 transcription in nasal epithelial cells.

We consider two types of households: a typical household for the DRC and a typical household for Kinshasa CKinshasa is the national capital and the largest city of the DRC.

Second, in relative terms, the consumption basket for a typical household in Kinshasa exhibits higher quasi-causal effects than that for a typical household only in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages and in prices of transport. Finally and more importantly, unlike developed countries where consumers spent more on food and other groceries during the pandemic, our results suggest that in response to the Covid-19 crisis, both the typical household in DRC and the typical household in Kinshasa spent more on health and communication.

For scRNA-seq data, variability in gene expression reflects the degree of variation in gene expression from one cell to another. Analyses that focus on cell-cell variability therefore are useful for going beyond changes based on average expression and instead, identifying genes with homogenous expression versus those that vary widely from cell to cell. Results We present a novel statistical framework scShapes for identifying differential distributions in single-cell RNA-sequencing data using generalized linear models. Most approaches for differential gene expression detect shifts in the mean value. However, as single cell data are driven by over-dispersion and dropouts, moving beyond means and using distributions that can handle excess zeros is critical. scShapes quantifies gene-specific cell-to-cell variability by testing for differences in the expression distribution while flexibly adjusting for covariates if required. We demonstrate that scShapes identifies subtle variations that are independent of altered mean expression and detects biologically-relevant genes that were not discovered through standard approaches. Conclusions This analysis also draws attention to genes that switch distribution shapes from a unimodal distribution to a zero-inflated distribution and raises open questions about the plausible biological mechanisms that may give rise to this, such as transcriptional bursting. Overall, the results from scShapes helps to expand our understanding of the role that gene expression plays in the transcriptional regulation of a specific perturbation or cellular phenotype.

Social media has been uniquely valuable and distinctly destructive when it comes to protecting and improving public health.","output":"'Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it': social media and public health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The adherence to public health recommendations to control COVID-19 spread is influenced by public knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). We performed this cross-sectional study to assess the levels and determinants of public KAP towards COVID-19 in a large, multinational sample. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (survey). SETTING: The questionnaire was distributed to potential respondents via online platforms. PARTICIPANTS: 71 890 individuals from 22 countries. METHODS: We formulated a four-section questionnaire in English, followed by validation and translation into seven languages. The questionnaire was distributed (May to June 2020) and each participant received a score for each KAP section. RESULTS: Overall, the participants had fair knowledge (mean score: 19.243.59) and attitudes (3.722.31) and good practices (12.121.83) regarding COVID-19. About 92% reported moderate to high compliance with national lockdown. However, significant gaps were observed: only 68.2% knew that infected individuals may be asymptomatic; 45.4% believed that antibiotics are an effective treatment; and 55.4% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the time of data collection). 71.9% believed or were uncertain that COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8% and 51% were afraid of contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4% reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had significantly (p&#8804;0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores. Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although the public have fair/good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19, significant gaps should be addressed. Future awareness efforts should target less advantaged groups and future studies should develop new strategies to tackle COVID-19 negative mental health effects.","output":"KAP-COVIDGLOBAL: a multinational survey of the levels and determinants of public knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic, the highest risk level in the infectious disease alert phase, on 11 March 2020 In the Western Pacific Region (WPR), 192,016 confirmed cases with 7125 deaths had been reported as of 8 June 2020 In people with diabetes COVID-19 can be more difficult to treat due to the wide fluctuations in blood glucose levels or presence of comorbidities such as diabetes complications, including cardiovascular disease and renal damage, which are recognized risks for adverse outcomes National diabetes associations and governments have established guidelines for subjects with diabetes in relation to COVID-19, and are trying to supply emergency and their regularly required medical products for them The WPR is so large and composed of such diverse countries and COVID-19 situations, no one conclusion or program applies Instead we could see a diverse COVID-19 pandemic profile in the WPR, and several creative diagnostic and therapeutic measures undertaken This includes drive-through screening facilities, high-speed RT-PCR technologies, convalescent patients' plasma therapy, which potentially had some positive contributions in combatting COVID-19 in the WPR as well as globally Although the numbers of confirmed cases are currently decreasing in the region, the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and many experts are recommending to prepare measures for potential second or third waves of COVID-19","output":"Diabetes and COVID-19: IDF perspective in the Western Pacific region.

It is likely that IAV interacts with histones during infection. We show that histone H4 binds to IAV and aggregates viral particles. In addition, histone H4 markedly potentiates IAV induced neutrophil respiratory burst responses. Prior studies have shown reactive oxidants to be detrimental during severe IAV infection. C reactive protein (CRP) and surfactant protein D (SP-D) rise during IAV infection. We now show that both of these innate immune proteins bind to histone H4 and significantly down regulate respiratory burst and other responses to histone H4. Isolated constructs composed only of the neck and carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D also bind to histone H4 and partially limit neutrophil responses to it. These studies indicate that complexes formed of histones and IAV are a potent neutrophil activating stimulus. This finding could account for excess inflammation during IAV or other severe viral infections. The ability of CRP and SP-D to bind to histone H4 may be part of a protective response against excessive inflammation in vivo.","output":"Histone H4 potentiates neutrophil inflammatory responses to influenza A virus: Down-modulation by H4 binding to C-reactive protein and Surfactant protein D"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Investigation of the $^{50}$V electron-capture to the $2^+$ 1553.8 keV level of $^{50}$Ti and search for $\\\\beta^-$ decay of $^{50}$V to the $2^+$ 783.3 keV level of $^{50}$Cr (both those decays are fourfold forbidden with $\\\\Delta J^{\\\\Delta \\\\pi}=4^+$) have been performed using a vanadium sample of natural isotopic abundance with mass of 955 g.

As opposed to intravenous injection, extended release subcutaneous injection has the benefits of reducing face-to-face contact, minimizing hospitalization, reducing dosing frequency and reducing overall health care cost. SelfExRem was developed using a biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), dissolved in a biocompatible vehicle. Six different batches were formulated using 2 different grades of low molecular weight PLGA and 3 different PLGA concentration. The force of injection of various polymeric solutions through 23-30-gauge needles were analyzed using a TA.XTplus texture analyzer.

Despite the distress, studies have suggested that nurses are able to experience positive changes (i.e. posttraumatic growth; PTG) during the pandemic. Research on other populations has also indicated that COVID-19-specific worries and work-related coping resources are associated with peoples positive changes during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study examined how socio-demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related worries, and work-related variables (satisfaction with work and workplace pandemic guidelines) were associated with PTG among nurses in Hong Kong. METHODS: Nurses (N = 1510) working in hospitals and community settings were recruited through nursing associations in Hong Kong between 8 August 2020 and 22 September 2020. They were invited to complete a cross-sectional survey measuring their sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 worries, and satisfaction with work and workplace pandemic-control measures. RESULTS: Results from hierarchical regressions found that those working non-full-time ( = ?0.06), affiliating with a religion ( = 0.24), having higher COVID-19-related worries and psychological distress (s ranging from 0.12C0.15), and having higher work satisfaction ( = 0.14) were associated with higher PTG (ps < .05). Moreover, a significant interaction between psychological distress and satisfaction with workplace pandemic control guidelines emerged in explaining PTG ( = 0.08, p < .05), such that guideline satisfaction was only associated with higher PTG among those with higher distress ( = 0.09, p = .03), but not those with lower distress ( = ?0.05, p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Nurses in Hong Kong did report positive changes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies could focus on the contributing factors of PTG to design for effective strategies to enhance resources for nurses to promote positive psychosocial outcomes.","output":"Finding the positives from the COVID-19 pandemic: factors associated with posttraumatic growth among nurses in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plitidepsin, a marine-derived cyclic-peptide, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication at nanomolar concentrations by targeting the host protein eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A.

The aim of this paper is to describe the prevalence and characteristics of prone-positioning pressure sores (PPPS) and analyze the related risk factors. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in Gregorio Maranon hospital in Madrid during the COVID-19 pandemic between April and May 2020. We enrolled 74 confirmed COVID-19 patients in critical care units with invasive mechanical ventilation who were treated with pronation therapy. There were 57 cases and 17 controls. Demographic data, pronation maneuver characteristics and PPPS features were analyzed. RESULTS: In the case group, a total number of 136 PPPS were recorded. The face was the most affected region (69%). Regarding the severity, stage II was the most frequent. The main variables associated with an increased risk of PPPS were the total number of days under pronation cycles, and PP maintained for more than 24 h. The prealbumin level at admission was significantly lower in the case group. All of the ulcers were treated with dressings. The most frequent acute complication was bleeding (5%). CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, PPPS are related to the characteristics of the maneuver and the previous nutritional state.

Materials and Methods: A systematic search was performed independently in Scopus, PubMed, ProQuest, and Google Scholar electronic databases as well as Preprint servers using the keywords under study. The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using I2 and {chi}2 statistics, according to which the I2 of > 50% and P-value <0.1 was reported as heterogeneity of the studies. In addition, the Pooled Vaccine Effectiveness (PVE) obtained from the studies was calculated by converting (1- Pooled estimate * 100%) based on the type of outcome. Results: A total of 54 records were included in this meta-analysis. The rate of PVE against SARS-COV 2 infection was about 71% (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.23-0.36) in the first dose and 87% (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.08-0.21) in the second, and the highest effectiveness in the first and second doses was that of BNT162b2 mRNA and combined studies. The PVE versus COVID-19-associated hospitalization was 73% (OR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.18-0.41) in the first dose and 89% (OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.07-0.17) in the second. mRNA-1273 and combined studies in the first dose and ChAdOx1 and mRNA-1273 in the second dose had the highest effectiveness. Regarding the COVID-19-related mortality, PVE was about 28% (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.23-0.45) in the first dose and 89% (HR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.03-0.43) in the second.

We consider explanations for this phenomenon, including prolonged high striving, competing demands between the environments upwardly mobile individuals seek to enter and their environments of origin, cultural mismatches between adaptive strategies from their childhood environments and those that are valued in higher-SES environments, and the sense of alienation, lack of belonging, and discrimination that upwardly mobile individuals face as they move into spaces set up by and for high-SES groups. These stressors are hypothesized to lead to unhealthy behaviors and a dysregulation of biological systems, with implications for cardiometabolic health.

To this end, we used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System; furthermore, we used a multidimensional metric, the social lag index (DISLI), to evaluate its interaction with mean urban population density (MUPD) and its impact on COVID-19 rates. Influence DISLI and MUPD on the effect of vehicular mobility policies on COVID-19 rates were also tested.

The impact of the pandemic on nuclear medicine departments and their services has not yet been established. The aim of this online survey was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on nuclear medicine departments. Methods: A web-based questionnaire, made available from April 16 to May 3, 2020, was designed to determine the impact of the pandemic on in- and outpatient nuclear medicine departments, including the number of procedures, employee health, availability of radiotracers and other essential supplies, and availability of personal protective equipment. The survey also inquired about operational aspects and types of facilities as well as other challenges. Results: A total of 434 responses from 72 countries were registered and analyzed. Respondents reported an average decline of 54% in diagnostic procedures. PET/CT scans decreased by an average of 36%, whereas sentinel lymph-node procedures decreased by 45%, lung scans by 56%, bone scans by 60%, myocardial studies by 66%, and thyroid studies by 67%. Of all participating centers, 81% performed radionuclide therapies, and they reported a reduction of 45% on average in the last 4 wk, ranging from over 76% in Latin America and South East Asia to 16% in South Korea and Singapore. Survey results showed that 52% of participating sites limited their (99m)Tc/(99)Mo generator purchases, and 12% of them temporarily cancelled orders.

This phenomenon of self-leadership was explained by using the theoretical lens of the social cognitive theory and intrinsic motivation theory. Data was collected from 318 employees who worked in the telecom sector in Pakistan and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) AMOS.

In this study, we describe a modular virus-like particle vaccine candidate displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology (RBD-SpyVLP). Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induced a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that was superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluated antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we showed that RBD-SpyVLP induced a polyclonal antibody response that recognised all key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. The induction of potent and polyclonal antibody responses by RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is highly resilient, thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence.","output":"A COVID-19 vaccine candidate using SpyCatcher multimerization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain induces potent neutralising antibody responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flies are known to be mechanical vectors of bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases.

Flies were transferred to plates of Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and allowed to walk on the bacteria for a total of 5 min. After the flies were contaminated, they were either immediately collected to quantify bacteria or were placed onto sterile plates to clean for 5 or 10 min. After cleaning, flies were placed into tubes with 1 ml of sterile 0.85% saline and were gently shaken for 1 min to remove bacteria. A serial dilution was made and 50-l spot titers were plated. Cleaning behavior was also monitored and scored for a period of 5 min. Results demonstrate a bacterial reduction for both bacteria on all three fly species. Sarcophaga bullata and D. virilis both showed a significant reduction of both bacteria within 10 min, whereas M. domestica only showed a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa.

As such, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) is empirically recommended until age of toilet training; however, there are limited data to support this. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the existing data and compare UTI rates in infants with asymptomatic VUR on CAP during the first year of life, to those not on CAP. Secondary objectives were to determine associated risk factors with UTI development. METHODS A systematic search of all relevant studies and abstracts was conducted using 4 electronic databases by utilizing appropriate key words by an expert hospital librarian. Eligible studies included children with prenatal hydronephrosis, asymptomatic VUR with or without CAP, and reported on development of UTI in the first year. RESULTS Of 6903 citations screened, 18 were selected, giving a total population of 829 (69.4% male, median age 57 days) who met the inclusion criteria.

RESULTS: There were differences in the CT severity score of the right lung in the initial CT, and total CT severity score in the initial and follow-up CT between the moderate group and the severe and critical group (all p < 0.05). There was a quadratic relationship between total CT severity score and CT follow-up time in the severe and critical group (r(2) = 0.137, p = 0.008), the total CT severity score peaked at the second follow-up CT. There was no correlation between total CT severity score and CT follow-up time in the moderate group (p > 0.05).

Because fluency and truth are frequently correlated in the real world, people learn to use processing fluency as a marker for truthfulness. Although the illusory truth effect is a robust phenomenon, almost all studies examining it have used three or fewer repetitions. To address this limitation, we conducted two experiments using a larger number of repetitions. In Experiment 1, we showed participants trivia statements up to 9 times and in Experiment 2 statements were shown up to 27 times. Later, participants rated the truthfulness of the previously seen statements and of new statements. In both experiments, we found that perceived truthfulness increased as the number of repetitions increased. However, these truth rating increases were logarithmic in shape.

METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively from medical records of 191 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from a tertiary single-center hospital between March and April 2020. Prognostic effects of variables on admission among patients who received intensive care unit (ICU) support and those who didnt require ICU care were compared. RESULTS: Patients required ICU care (n = 46) were older (median, 71 vs. 43 years), with more underlying comorbidities (76.1% vs. 33.1%). ICU patients had lower lymphocytes, percentage of large unstained cell (%LUC), hemoglobin, total protein, and albumin, but higher leucocytes, neutrophils, neutrophilClymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-lymphocytes ratio (PLR), urea, creatinine, aspartate amino transferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer when compared with non-critically ill patients (p < 0.001).

Vaccines have limited hospitalisation and death from earlier variants in this vulnerable population. With the rise of Omicron and future variants, it is vital to sustain and broaden vaccine-induced protection. We examined the effect of boosting with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on humoral immunity and Omicron-specific neutralising activity among NH residents and healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: We longitudinally enrolled 85 NH residents (median age 77) and 48 HCWs (median age 51), and sampled them after the initial vaccination series; and just before and 2 weeks after booster vaccination. Anti-spike, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralisation titres to the original Wuhan strain and neutralisation to the Omicron strain were obtained. FINDINGS: Booster vaccination significantly increased vaccine-specific anti-spike, anti-RBD, and neutralisation levels above the pre-booster levels in NH residents and HCWs, both in those with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Omicron-specific neutralisation activity was low after the initial 2 dose series with only 28% of NH residents and 28% HCWs titres above the assay's lower limit of detection. Omicron neutralising activity following the booster lifted 86% of NH residents and 93% of HCWs to the detectable range. INTERPRETATION: With boosting, the vast majority of HCWs and NH residents developed detectable Omicron-specific neutralising activity. These data provide immunologic evidence that strongly supports booster vaccination to broaden neutralising activity and counter waning immunity in the hope it will better protect this vulnerable, high-risk population against the Omicron variant.

At present, Ayurvedic clinicians do not have access to COVID-19 patients in clinical settings. In these circumstances, a preliminary clinical profiling of COVID-19 based on review of modern medical and classical Ayurvedic literature with inputs from Allopathic clinicians treating COVID-19 patients assumes significance. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to develop an Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19 by literature review supported by analysis of clinical data of a cohort of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The typical Clinical Presentation of COVID-19 was categorized based on a cluster of symptoms with reference to Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) released by the US CDC. As the clinical presentation is found to vary widely, research papers reporting clinical symptoms of patient samples from different parts of the world were also reviewed to identify outliers and atypical presentations. Case Records of fourteen COVID-19 patients treated at Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon were analyzed to compare symptomatology with data obtained from published literature. Further, a careful correlation was done with the data collected from selected Ayurvedic classical texts and expert views of clinical practitioners to arrive at a preliminary Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 can be provisionally understood from the Ayurvedic perspective as vtakapha dominant sanniptajvara of gantu origin with pittnubandha. The asymptomatic, presymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical stages of COVID-19 with varying clinical presentations have been analysed on the basis of nidna, do?a, d?ya, nidnapa?caka and ?a?kriykla to present a preliminary clinical profile of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we have demonstrated that a preliminary clinical profiling of COVID-19 from the Ayurvedic perspective is possible through literature review supported by discussions with Allopathic clinicians as well as examination of patient case records. The provisional diagnosis proposed can be further developed with continued review of literature, wider cooperation and teamwork with Allopathic physicians and access to clinical data as well as direct clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19 C A preliminary report()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many diverse strategies allow and facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to evade antiviral innate immune mechanisms.

In vitro, pDCs did not endocytose Leishmania promastigotes but nevertheless released interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta and interleukin (IL)-12 in a TLR9-dependent manner. mDCs rapidly internalized Leishmania and, in the presence of TLR9, produced IL-12, but not IFN-alpha/beta. Depletion of pDCs did not impair the activation of NK cells in L. infantum-infected mice. In contrast, L. infantum-induced NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production were abolished in mDC-depleted mice. The same phenotype was observed in TLR9(-/-) mice, which lacked IL-12 expression by mDCs, and in IL-12(-/-) mice, whereas IFN-alpha/beta receptor(-/-) mice showed only a minor reduction of NK cell IFN-gamma expression.

A few researchers and journalists described a new form of fatigue associated with a massive use of technology, including videoconferencing platforms. In this study, this type of fatigue was referred to as Online Fatigue. A new tool (the Online Fatigue Scale) was developed, and its psychometric properties were evaluated. This tool was used to assess Online Fatigue among Italian academics and to examine its associations with psychological and physical health. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in December 2020 on a sample of Italian academics. Besides the Online Fatigue Scale (11 items) used to assess Online Fatigue, the survey was composed of questionnaires (including validated measures) focused on sociodemographic and job-related information, technostress creators, health status, psychological well-being, and COVID-related perceived distress. The psychometric properties of the Online Fatigue Scale were evaluated, and statistical analyses were conducted to examine the associations between Online Fatigue and all the other variables. RESULTS: Participants were 307 academics aged 24C70 years old (mean age = 40.7; SD = 10.1). The Online Fatigue Scale showed good psychometric properties. Two subscales were identified: Off-Balance Fatigue and Virtual Relations Fatigue. High levels of Off-Balance Fatigue were associated with a greater use of technology, female gender, and presence of minor children. Participants with high scores on both subscales reported a greater frequency of psychosomatic symptoms, unhealthy habits, poorer psychological well-being, and greater Covid-related perceived distress.

Unfortunately, patients with severe CU, refractory to conventional treatment, have limited and expensive therapeutic options. The pathogenesis of CU is not yet completely understood. Therefore, elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms involved would potentially identify new therapeutic targets. It has been accepted in recent years that mast cells and their activation, followed by excessive degranulation represent the key pathophysiological events in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The triggering events and the complexity of the effector mechanisms, however, remain intensely debated topics with conflicting studies. One pathogenetic mechanism incriminated in chronic spontaneous urticaria is the response mediated by the high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc?RI) expressed on mast cells. Increasing recognition of chronic spontaneous urticaria as an autoimmune disease linked to the cytokine-chemokine network imbalance resulting from alteration of innate immune response is another pathogenetic explanation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between pet ownership, physical activity levels and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 19 to July 13, 2020 among Singapore residents aged 21 to 64 years through a previously published questionnaire. Inverse probability treatment weighting was used to develop mixed-effects models for outcome comparisons. We recorded participant data on pet ownership, duration and intensity of physical activity, and RAND 36-item Health Survey mental health domains during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 431 pet owners and 103 non-pet owners. A greater proportion of pet owners were female, non-married, employed and owned pets in the past. Pet owners reported 31.8 (95% CI 13.6 to 50; p = .001) more minutes per week of mild-intensity physical activity compared to non-pet owners. No statistically significant differences were found for moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity. Pet owners had better emotional well-being (? = 9.66, 95% CI 4.97 to 14.4; p < .001), energy (? = 8.29, 95% CI 3.46 to 13.1; p = .001) and social functioning (? = 11.2, 95% CI 5.03 to 17.4; p < .001) scores than non-pet owners. However, no statistically significant difference was observed for general health scores. Pet owner physical activity levels, general health, emotional well-being and energy scores correlated positively with pet attachment scores. CONCLUSION: Pet ownership was associated with greater physical activity levels and better mental health, particularly in main caregivers with higher pet attachment scores. These findings suggest that pet ownership is beneficial to physical and mental well-being during periods of social isolation amidst a global pandemic.","output":"Association between pet ownership and physical activity and mental health during the COVID-19 circuit breaker in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed the balances from the transfers from the Ministry of Health (MH) to subnational entities, to finance the Unified Health System (SUS), including for COVID-19.

Thus, there is an urgent need for developing treatments for COVID-19. Drug repurposing, which is the process of reusing already-approved drugs for new medical conditions, can be a good way to solve this problem quickly and broadly. Many clinical trials for COVID-19 patients using treatments for other diseases have already been in place or will be performed at clinical sites in the near future. Additionally, patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, kidney diseases, hypertension, and asthma are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Thus, the relationship of comorbidity disease with COVID-19 may help to find repurposable drugs. To reduce trial and error in finding treatments for COVID-19, we propose building a network-based drug repurposing framework to prioritize repurposable drugs. First, we utilized knowledge of COVID-19 to construct a disease-gene-drug network (DGDr-Net) representing a COVID-19-centric interactome with components for diseases, genes, and drugs. DGDr-Net consisted of 592 diseases, 26,681 human genes and 2,173 drugs, and medical information for 18 common comorbidities. The DGDr-Net recommended candidate repurposable drugs for COVID-19 through network reinforcement driven scoring algorithms. The scoring algorithms determined the priority of recommendations by utilizing graph-based semi-supervised learning. From the predicted scores, we recommended 30 drugs, including dexamethasone, resveratrol, methotrexate, indomethacin, quercetin, etc., as repurposable drugs for COVID-19, and the results were verified with drugs that have been under clinical trials.

We propose a novel overall impact of uncertainty (OIU) measure, explained using a natural phenomenon analogy of the overall impact of a rainstorm, to gauge the magnitude and intensity of the impact of uncertainty on energy sector returns. Drawing upon economic psychology, COVID-19 related uncertainty is measured in terms of searches for information relating to COVID-19 as captured by Google search trends. Our results show that the energy sectors of countries further west from the outbreak of the virus in China are impacted to a greater extent by COVID-19 related uncertainty. A similar observation is made for net energy and oil exporters relative to importers. We also find that the impact of uncertainty on most national energy sectors intensified and then weakened as the pandemic evolved.

Meanwhile, few studies focused on the midterm sequelae, which still remain largely unknown. AIM: To assess the physical performance of COVID-19 survivors at 3 to 6 months from Hospital discharge. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study focused on mid-term functional outcomes evaluation in COVID-19 survivors. SETTING: Outpatients who had been previously hospitalized due to COVID-19 from March to May 2020 at the University Hospital of Novara, Italy. POPULATION: We enrolled 204 patients, of which 60% were men, with the mean age of 57.9 years. METHODS: Patients firstly underwent the short physical performance battery test (SPPB), which is composed of a series of physical tests assessing the lower limb function and the functional status of the subjects. Subsequently, based on SPPB results, patients' cardiorespiratory fitness performance was further investigated. Patients with normal SPPB score (SPPB>10) underwent the 2-minute walking test (2MWT) whereas, in order to safely test the cardiorespiratory function, in patients with abnormal SPPB score (SPPB&#8804;10) the 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1MSTST) was performed. It should be noted that the 1MSTST can be safely performed even by subjects with compromised walking ability. RESULTS: Overall, 66 patients (32% of our sample) showed an impaired physical performance at 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge. In particular, 29 patients presented an SPPB score &#8804;10, and the 1MSTST confirmed this status in the whole group (100%) compared to the reference values for age and sex. Besides, among patients with a normal SPPB score, 37 showed a lower sex- and age-matched 2MWT score. Finally, a significant association between Intensive Care Unit hospitalization or mechanical ventilation and physical impairment was observed together with a significant association between the walking ability (measured with SPPB and 2MWT) and the number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: A residual physical and functional impairment was observed in COVID-19 survivors at mid-term evaluation after hospitalization. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Considering the current COVID-19 epidemiology, we might expect a tremendous burden of disability in the next future.

Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with OAB syndrome. This study evaluated the relationship between vitamin D status and OAB-related symptoms and QoL in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 52 pediatric patients with OAB-related urinary incontinence and 41 healthy children. LUTS were assessed using the Dysfunctional Voiding and Incontinence Symptoms Score (DVISS) questionnaire, and QoL was assessed using the Pediatric Incontinence Questionnaire (PINQ). Oral vitamin D supplementation was given to patients with OAB with vitamin D deficiency. Urinary symptoms and QoL were evaluated before and after vitamin D supplementation. RESULTS Vitamin D deficiency was more common in the OAB group (75%) than in the control group (36.6%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that vitamin D status (<20ng/mL) was a significant predictor of OAB. Both pre-treatment and post-treatment DVISS and PINQ scores showed a positive correlation. After vitamin D supplementation, 8 (23.5%) patients had a complete response and 19 (55.9%) patients had a partial response. Significant improvement in QoL was also achieved. CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D deficiency is more common in children with urinary incontinence and OAB than in healthy children. Although vitamin D deficiency is not routinely evaluated for every patient, it should be evaluated in treatment-resistant OAB cases.

We investigated the influence of personal protective equipment on out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: Randomised controlled non-inferiority triple-crossover study. Forty-eight emergency medical service providers, randomized into teams of two, performed 12a?min of basic life support (BLS) on a manikin after climbing 3 flights of stairs. Three scenarios were completed in a randomised order: Without personal protective equipment, with personal protective equipment including a filtering face piece (FFP) 2 mask with valve, and with personal protective equipment including an FFP2 mask without valve. The primary outcome was mean depth of chest compressions with a pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 3.5a?mm. Secondary outcomes included other measurements of CPR quality, providers' subjective exhaustion levels, and providers' vital signs, including end-tidal CO2. RESULTS: Differences regarding the primary outcome were well below the pre-defined non-inferiority margins for both control vs. personal protective equipment without valve (absolute difference 1a?mm, 95% CI [-1, 2]) and control vs. personal protective equipment with valve (absolute difference 1a?mm, [-0.2, 2]). This was also true for secondary outcomes regarding quality of chest compressions and providers' vital signs including etCO2. Subjective physical strain after BLS was higher in the personal protective equipment groups (Borg 4 (SD 3) without valve, 4 (SD 2) with valve) than in the control group (Borg 3 (SD 2)).

Our objective was to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seroprevalence amongst HCW and factors associated with seropositivity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study evaluating 6190 workers (97.8% of the total workforce of a healthcare-system of 17 hospitals across four regions in Spain) was carried out between April and June 2020, by measuring immunoglobulin G (IgG)-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and related clinical data. Exposure risk was categorized as high (clinical environment; prolonged/direct contact with patients), moderate (clinical environment; non-intense/no patient contact) and low (non-clinical environment). RESULTS: A total of 6038 employees (mean age 43.8 years; 71% female) were included in the final analysis. A total of 662 (11.0%) were seropositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (39.4% asymptomatic). Adding available PCR-testing, 713 (11.8%) employees showed evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, before antibody testing, 482 of them (67%) had no previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection. Seroprevalence was higher in high- and moderate-risk exposure (12.1 and 11.4%, respectively) compared with low-grade risk subjects (7.2%), and in Madrid (13.8%) compared with Barcelona (7.6%) and Coru?a (2.0%). High-risk [odds ratio (OR): 2.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-2.62] and moderate-risk (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.32-2.37) exposures were associated with positive IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after adjusting for region, age and sex. Higher antibody titres were observed in moderate-severe disease (median antibody-titre: 13.7 AU/mL) compared with mild (6.4 AU/mL) and asymptomatic (5.1 AU/mL) infection, and also in older (>60 years: 11.8 AU/mL) compared with younger (<30 years: 4.2 AU/mL) people. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCW is a little higher than in the general population and varies depending on regional COVID-19 incidence. The high rates of subclinical and previously undiagnosed infection observed in this study reinforce the utility of antibody screening. An occupational risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection related to working in a clinical environment was demonstrated in this HCW cohort.","output":"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in over 6000 healthcare workers in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study analyses the case of urban sustainability in Mumbai in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and aims to identify the relationship between the existing sustainability issues and the spread of the pandemic across the administrative wards of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai It also tries to delve into the reasons behind the observed relationships to establish the patterns created by the COVID-19 pandemic in Mumbai by the end of August 2020 The study relies on secondary sources of data, that include reports published by government agencies, news articles, journals and websites The study comprises a large amount of quantitative data that were analyzed using ArcGIS 10 4 1 and SPSS 23 The qualitative data collected through an extensive literature review was used alongside the quantitative data to support the study The findings reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic had a varied impact across the wards of Mumbai, which was found to be associated with the unequal socio-economic conditions that prevail across the city This inequality has contributed to Mumbais reduced resilience, for building which the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have to be achieved ? 2021, Russian Geographical Society All rights reserved","output":"Pandemic and urban sustainability: Analyzing the COVID-19 scenario in Mumbai, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of a pandemic, finding effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the urgent issue.

However, the effect of synchronized NPIs for the control of COVID-19 at temporal and spatial scales has not been well studied. Therefore, a meta-population model that incorporates essential nonlinear processes was constructed to uncover the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and then assess the effectiveness of synchronized NPIs on COVID-19 dynamics in China.

Using a murine model of IAV infection, we observed that aging increased the level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of aged mice compared to young mice.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the full-length genome sequences of the Chinese IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/97I and its embryo-passaged, attenuated level to identify sequence substitutions responsible for the attenuation and define markers of attenuation. METHODS: The full-length genomes of CK/CH/LDL/97I P5 and P115 were amplified and sequenced. The sequences were assembled and compared using the MEGALIGN program (DNAStar) and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA4 software. RESULTS: The CK/CH/LDL/97I virus population contained subpopulations with a mixture of genetic mutants. Changes were observed in nsp4, nsp9, nsp11/12, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16, and ORF3a, but these did not result in amino acid substitutions or did not show functional variations. Amino acid substitutions occurred in the remaining genes between P5 and P115; most were found in the S region, and some of the nucleotide mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions. Among the 9 nsps in the ORF1 region, nsp3 contained the most nucleotide substitutions. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence variations in different genes, especially the S gene and nsp3, in the genomes of CK/CH/LDL/97I viruses might contribute to differences in viral replication, pathogenicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and tissue tropism.","output":"Genomic Characteristics and Changes of Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus Strain CK/CH/LDL/97I after Serial Passages in Chicken Embryos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Earlier this year, Spain took center stage in the emerging health crisis due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic On 14 March 2020, a state of alarm was declared to manage this health crisis The contribution of nursing professionals to sustainability of the system during this health crisis has been vital, not only in specialized care but, in a more understated way, in primary care The objective of the present study was to describe the perceptions and lived experiences of primary care nurses during the COVID-19 health emergency A qualitative study taking a phenomenological approach was carried out, triangulating data collected through non-participant observations, eight in-depth interviews, and two discussion groups with community nurses and case managers A total sample of 20 key informants was obtained during the month of May, 2020 The key informants expressed strong positive perceptions of the recognition received from service users and satisfaction when acknowledging that they have been an important source of emotional support Informants identify the importance of their work in sustaining the system, particularly outlining team cohesion and communication, whilst also evaluating the empowering position in which service users and society itself has put them","output":"Nursing as a Sustainability Factor of the Health System during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing work on privacy-preserving machine learning with Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) is almost exclusively focused on model training and on inference with trained models, thereby overlooking the important data pre-processing stage.

While little is known about how face masks affect the therapeutic experience of patients and therapists, the effectiveness of telepsychiatry is well documented for several psychiatric disorders. However, research on the benefits of telepsychiatry in adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains scarce. This seems problematic since the symptoms typically associated with ADHD, such as attention problems and distractibility, may lessen the utility of telepsychiatry for this particular group. The present study's aim was to explore how adult patients with ADHD and their therapists experienced therapy sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic in three different settings: face-to-face with the therapist wearing a face mask, via telephone, or via videoconferencing. METHODS: In this exploratory, quantitatively driven mixed-method study (quantitative questionnaire data and qualitative data from open-ended responses), we assessed patients' evaluation of the session, their treatment satisfaction, and patients' and therapists' ratings of therapeutic alliance. We also collected qualitative comments on both sides' experience of the session. Overall, 97 therapist and 66 patient questionnaires were completed. Results are reported for the N = 60 cases for which data from both parties were available. Sequential multiple regressions adjusted for therapist and number of sessions were used for the main quantitative analyses. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences regarding session flow, post-session positivity, satisfaction and therapeutic alliance were observed. The only exception was that telepsychiatric sessions were rated as significantly less deep than face-to-face sessions, an effect that may decline over time, especially in the videoconferencing group. Patients and therapists identified similar facilitating and complicating aspects, but differed in their emphasis of specific elements. CONCLUSIONS: Both settings, on-site with the therapist wearing a face mask and telepsychiatric, seem to be valid options to continue treatment of adults with ADHD during a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Aspects such as patient preference, session content, and therapeutic methods may be useful to identify the most suitable modality.","output":"Treatment provision for adults with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic: an exploratory study on patient and therapist experience with on-site sessions using face masks vs. telepsychiatric sessions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There is pressing need to improve hospital-based addiction care.

Several infectious and noninfectious factors are implicated in calf diarrhea, but disease control remains problematic because of the multifactorial etiology of the disease. Here, we conducted diagnostic multiplex PCR assay and meta-omics analysis (16S rRNA gene-based metataxonomics and untargeted transcriptional profiling) of rectal content of normal and diarrheic beef calves (n = 111). In the diarrheic calf gut, we detected both microbial compositional dysbiosis (i.e., increased abundances of the family Enterobacteriaceae members and their lytic bacteriophages) and functional dysbiosis (i.e., elevated levels of aerobic respiration and virulence potential). The calf diarrheic transcriptome mirrored the gene expression of the bovine host and was enriched in cellular pathways of sulfur metabolism, innate immunity, and gut motility. We then isolated 12 nontoxigenic Enterobacteriaceae strains from the gut of diarrheic calves. Feeding a strain mixture to preweaning mice resulted in a significantly higher level of fecal moisture content, with decreased body weight gain and shortened colon length. The presented findings suggest that gut inflammation followed by a prolonged expansion of nontoxigenic autochthonous Enterobacteriaceae contributes to the onset of diarrhea in preweaning animals.

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed dilation of an intrahepatic portal vein branch and an intrahepatic aneurysm, with splenomegaly and ascites. Hepatic arteriovenous fistula/hepatic artery-portal vein fistula with multiple acquired portosystemic shunts was strongly suspected.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the existence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among these genes, and the association of variability at these genes with susceptibility and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We also studied the effect of genetic variability on SP-D serum levels. METHODS: Seven non-synonymous polymorphisms of SFTPA1, SFTPA2 and SFTPD were analyzed. For susceptibility, 682 CAP patients and 769 controls were studied in a case-control study. Severity and outcome were evaluated in a prospective study. Haplotypes were inferred and LD was characterized. SP-D serum levels were measured in healthy controls. RESULTS: The SFTPD aa11-C allele was significantly associated with lower SP-D serum levels, in a dose-dependent manner. We observed the existence of LD among the studied genes.

We used blood samples taken soon after vaccination from individuals who were vaccinated and previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with no evidence of previous infection. We isolated and sequence-confirmed live Omicron virus from an infected person and observed that Omicron requires the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to infect cells. We compared plasma neutralization of Omicron relative to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and found that neutralization of ancestral virus was much higher in infected and vaccinated individuals compared with the vaccinated-only participants. However, both groups showed a 22-fold reduction in vaccine-elicited neutralization by the Omicron variant. Participants who were vaccinated and had previously been infected exhibited residual neutralization of Omicron similar to the level of neutralization of the ancestral virus observed in the vaccination-only group. These data support the notion that reasonable protection against Omicron may be maintained using vaccination approaches.","output":"Omicron extensively but incompletely escapes Pfizer BNT162b2 neutralization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, contain crown-like spikes on its surface, exceptional of large RNA genome, and a special replication machinery. Common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 include cough, common cold, fever, sore throat, and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease (SARD) such as pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells, T-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and also influences the production and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Repurposing of various drugs during this emergency condition can reduce the rate of mortality as well as time and cost.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between May 2014 and June 2015, three consecutive oncologic patients (mean age 65 years; range 57-75 years) with symptomatic pathological shoulder-girdle fractures unsuitable for surgery and radiotherapy underwent percutaneous image-guided screw fixation. Fractures occurred through metastases (n = 2) or a post-ablation cavity (n = 1). Mechanical properties of osteosynthesis were adjudged superior to stand-alone cementoplasty in each case. Cannulated screws were placed under combined CT and fluoroscopic guidance with complementary radiofrequency ablation or cementoplasty to optimise local palliation and secure screw fixation, respectively, in two cases. Follow-up was undertaken every few weeks until mortality or most recent appointment. RESULTS Four pathological fractures were treated in three patients (2 acromion, 1 clavicular, 1 coracoid). Mean size of associated lesion was 2.6 cm (range 1-4.5 cm). Technical success was achieved in all cases (100 %), without complications. Good palliation and restoration of mobility were observed in two cases at 2-3 months; one case could not be followed due to early post-procedural oncologic mortality. CONCLUSION Percutaneous image-guided shoulder-girdle osteosynthesis appears technically feasible with good short-term efficacy in this complex patient subset.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In the phantom experiment, seven robot-assisted punctures were made to evaluate the accuracy of the method. In the animal experiment, 18 punctures (nine robotic and nine manual) were made in the livers of nine rabbits. The indicators, such as needle-tract length, angle deviation, puncture accuracy, number of scans required, and radiation exposure dose were compared between manual and robotic punctures. The paired-samples t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS In the phantom experiment, the mean accuracy of seven punctures was 2.67 mm. In the animal experiment, there was no significant difference in needle-tract length (32.58 mm vs. 34.04 mm, p = .606), angle deviation (17.21 vs. 21.23 p = .557) and puncture accuracy (8.42 vs. 8.77 mm, p = .851) between the two groups.

Medical staff is potentially exposed when this gas leaks into the operating room through the instruments and past trocar valves. No detailed studies currently exist that have quantified these leakage pathways. Therefore, the goal of this study was to quantify the gas leakages through trocars and instruments, during minimally invasive procedures. METHODS: A model of the surgical environment was created, consisting of a rigid container with an interface for airtight clamping of laparoscopic equipment such as trocars and surgical instruments. The model was insufflated to 15 mm Hg using a pressure generator and a pneumotachograph measured the equipment gas leak. A protocol of several use cases was designed to simulate the motions and forces the surgeon exerts on the trocar during surgery. RESULTS: Twenty-three individual trocars and twenty-six laparoscopic instruments were measured for leakage under the different conditions of the protocol. Trocar leakages varied between 0 L/min and more than 30 L/min, the instruments revealed a range of leakages between 0 L/min and 5.5 L/min. The results showed that leakage performance varied widely between trocars and instruments and that the performance and location of the valves influenced trocar leakage. CONCLUSIONS: We propose trocar redesigns to overcome specific causes of gas leaks. Moreover, an international testing standard for CO(2) leakage for all new trocars and instruments is needed so surgical teams can avoid this potential health hazard when selecting new equipment.","output":"Characterisation of trocar associated gas leaks during laparoscopic surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a significant increase in the demand for palliative and end of life care, particularly in the community.

METHODS This was a nationwide historical cohort study of 849,086 Medicare enrollees from 2011-2013 who were admitted to the SNF from a hospital without a history of dementia. Delirium was determined through positive Confusion Assessment Method screen and incident AD/ADRD through active diagnosis or claims. Cox proportional hazard models predicted the risk of receiving one of three psychoactive medications (i.e., antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antiepileptics) within 7 days of SNF admission and within the entire SNF stay. RESULTS Of 849,086 newly-admitted SNF patients (62.6% female, mean age 78), 6.1% had delirium (of which 35.4% received an incident diagnosis of AD/ADRD); 12.6% received antipsychotics, 30.4% benzodiazepines, and 5.8% antiepileptics. Within 7 days of admission, patients with delirium and incident dementia were more likely to receive an antipsychotic (relative risk [RR] 3.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.99 to 3.20), or a benzodiazepine (RR 1.23; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.27) than patients without either condition.

METHODS: Major databases were searched (Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL), producing 1706 articles that were sifted by title, abstract, and full-text. A narrative approach was adopted for data synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers met the inclusion criteria, covering MG of varying sizes and settings, and including 9 observational studies, 10 outbreak reports, 4 event reports, and a quasi-experimental study. There is some evidence that certain types of MG may be associated with increased risk of influenza transmission. MG may also seed new strains into an area, and may instigate community transmission in a pandemic. Restricting MGs, in combination with other social distancing interventions, may help reduce transmission, but it was not possible to identify conclusive evidence on the individual effect of MG restriction alone. Evidence suggests that event duration and crowdedness may be the key factors that determine the risk of influenza transmission, and possibly the type of venue (indoor/outdoor).

Severe respiratory symptoms are a hallmark of the disease, which may also include complications related to a hypercoagulable state and central nervous system involvement. These complications can occur during either the acute or the recovery phase. The cerebral involvement typically manifests as intracranial hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, diffuse encephalopathy, or cerebral venous thrombosis. The hemorrhagic form of cerebral venous thrombosis can be a diagnostic challenge and is treated by anticoagulation therapy, despite the existence of an intracerebral hemorrhage. This report describes a case of superficial cerebral venous thrombosis and intracerebral hematoma in a 48-year-old man weeks after recovering from the acute phase of SARSCoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old man with a past medical history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction presented with left upper-limb numbness, weakness, and impaired positional sensorium. After initial stabilization, noncontrast computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an intracerebral hemorrhage with underlying cerebral venous thrombosis. The patient was successfully treated with enoxaparin anticoagulation therapy, and symptoms improved over the following 12 days.

The design fills the smartphone sensor fully at the lowest magnification and matches the fixed focus of the slit-lamp. It comes with a smartphone for instant photo-documentation, an in-built software application for data-management and secure HIPAA compliant cloud storage, and a Bluetooth trigger for a one-tap image capture.

Atrial fibrillation often goes undetected with traditional electrocardiogram monitoring techniques. We evaluated whether atrial fibrillation detection using continuous long-term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor is cost-effective for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with cryptogenic stroke, in comparison to the standard of care. METHODS A lifetime Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of insertable cardiac monitors from a UK National Health Service perspective using data from the randomized CRYSTAL-AF trial and other published literature. We also conducted scenario analyses (CHADS2 score) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. All costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS Monitoring cryptogenic stroke patients with an insertable cardiac monitor was associated with fewer recurrent strokes and increased quality-adjusted life years compared to the standard of care (7.37 vs 7.22). Stroke-related costs were reduced in insertable cardiac monitor patients, but overall costs remained higher than the standard of care (19,631 vs 17,045). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 17,175 per quality-adjusted life years gained, compared to standard of care in the base-case scenario, which is below established quality-adjusted life years willingness-to-pay thresholds. When warfarin replaced non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants as the main anticoagulation therapy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 13,296 per quality-adjusted life years gained.

This study focused on Indonesian residents who intended to travel abroad for vacation in 2020, but their plan was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected using a convenience sampling technique and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The PLS-SEM enables us to predict the key factors that affect post-pandemic travel intentions. The results show that affective risk perception has a positive relationship with perceived behavioural control and non-pharmaceutical intervention.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of respiratory viruses in the lower airways of individuals undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, with and without acute lower respiratory infection (respectively WRI and WORI groups). METHODS: We studied 44 mini-bronchoalveolar lavage samples (collected with a double catheter, Combicath? kit) from patients with mean age in the seventh decade, 20 from WORI group and 24 from WRI group, who were hospitalized for acute respiratory failure in Intensive Care Units of two hospitals in the Lisbon area. Real-time PCR was applied to verify analyse the presence of 15 common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, human bocavirus, influenza virus A and B, repiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4, human enterovirus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus group 1 (229E, NL63) and 2 (OC43, HKU1). RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in six of the 20 patients in the WORI group: influenza AH3 (n = 2), parainfluenza virus 1/3 (n = 2), human rhinovirus (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 1) and human metapneumovirus (n = 1).

PURPOSE: Although outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) can be a good approach to treatment of infections, a lack of data regarding antibiotic stability in portable elastomeric infusion devices restricts its safe, appropriate, and effective use. The objective of this work was to complete a systematic peer-reviewed analysis of published articles about antibiotic stability in elastomeric infusion devices that provide evidence supporting their use in OPAT. SUMMARY: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted in January 2021 to identify published articles about antibiotic stability in portable elastomeric infusion devices. The databases used were PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and a Cochrane database. A total of 1,615 original studies and conference communications were found. After title, abstract, and full-text review, 33 articles met the inclusion criteria. The data obtained included information about the stability of 30 different antibiotics. To our knowledge, this is the first review to summarize the available published data on the stability of antibiotics in portable elastomeric infusion devices. The results highlight the poor stability of some antibiotics in solution and the variability of the laboratory conditions in the included studies. CONCLUSION: This systematic review can serve as a useful resource for healthcare professionals involved in providing OPAT using portable elastomeric infusion devices. However, further stability studies should be performed, especially high-quality studies simulating real-life time and temperature conditions.","output":"Antibiotic stability in portable elastomeric infusion devices: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Municipal governments are experts in social non-distancing.

It has now been clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 resides in the upper airways and transmits easily via aerosols and droplets, which significantly increases the risk of infection when performing upper airway procedures. Ventilated COVID-19 patients in a critical condition in the intensive care unit may require tracheotomy for long-term ventilation and to improve weaning. However, the risk of secondary infection of medical personnel performing subsequent tracheostomy care remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the risk of droplet dispersion during tracheostomy tube change and overview tracheostomy tube change in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature was reviewed, quantitative and qualitative analyses of droplet formation during tracheostomy tube change in na?= 8 patients were performed, and an overview of and checklist for tracheostomy tube change were compiled. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that tracheostomy tube change, in particular insertion of the new tube, may cause significant droplet formation. The aerosolization of particles smaller than 5a?m was not analyzed. CONCLUSION: Our data, together with the current literature, clearly emphasize that tracheostomy care is associated with a high infection risk and should only be performed by a small group of well-trained, maximally protected healthcare personnel.","output":"Management von Patienten mit Tracheostoma w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie: Literaturberblick und Demonstration./ [Management of tracheostomy patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: review of the literature and demonstration]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use data on deaths in New York City, Madrid, Stockholm, and other world cities as well as in various U.S. states and various countries and regions to estimate a standard epidemiological model of COVID-19.

We evaluated the incidence of VaTE in outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at our institution in order to assess the potential need for thromboprophylaxis in outpatient COVID-19 management. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of outpatients in the University of North Carolina Health System who tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 between March 15 and June 20, 2020. Patients were diagnosed at one of 17 ambulatory respiratory diagnostic centers (n=706), or diagnosed and subsequently discharged from one of 11 emergency departments (n=1967) in the UNC system. Diagnosis was made using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples. The study outcome was the diagnosis of a vascular thromboembolic event within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. This included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, superficial thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and systemic arterial thromboembolism. VaTE was defined based on documentation of an associated ICD-10 code in the patient's electronic medical record within the specified time frame. Outcomes data were reported as incidence rates for the entire study population. Results 2673 outpatients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the study period. The mean age for this cohort was 37.9  17.3 years and 54% were female. 20 unique individuals (0.7%) experienced a VaTE within 30 days of diagnosis. Of these, 3 (15%) experienced venous thromboembolic events, 16 (80%) experienced arterial events, and 1 patient experienced both. Mean time to VaTE was 12.8  9.3 days. Within 30 days of diagnosis, 188 of these patients (7%) had an emergency department visit or experienced hospital observation or inpatient admission. Conclusions We found that the incidence of VaTE in outpatients with mild COVID-19 is low. Limitations of this study include that patients were not routinely screened for VaTE and may have sought treatment for thrombotic complications outside the hospital system. This may have led to an underestimate of the true incidence; however, the findings are in line with data showing that non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to be younger and have fewer medical comorbidities than hospitalized patients.3 This argues against the routine use of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the safety of hemithyroidectomy in an outpatient setting compared to an inpatient setting. The objectives were to (1) find the proportion of PTB in patients scheduled for outpatient hemithyroidectomy, (2) examine if outpatient hemithyroidectomy is clinically safe compared to an inpatient setting and (3) evaluate which selection criteria are most relevant for hemithyroidectomy in an outpatient setting. METHODS A systematic review was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid) and the Cochrane Library from inception until September 2021. We included studies reporting on PTB of patients after hemithyroidectomy in an outpatient setting. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa tool. The results were synthesised using Bayesian meta-analysis. Certainty in evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. RESULTS This review included 11 cohort studies and 9 descriptive studies reporting solely on outpatients resulting in a total of 46,866 patients. PTB was experienced by 58 of the 9025 outpatients (0.6%) and 415 of the 37,841 inpatients (1.1%). There was no difference between the PTB rate of outpatients and inpatients (RR 0.715 CrI [0.396-1.243]). The certainty of the evidence was very low due to the high risk of bias. CONCLUSION The risk of PTB in an outpatient setting is very low, and outpatient hemithyroidectomy should be considered clinically safe. The most relevant selection criteria to consider in outpatient hemithyroidectomy are (1) relevant comorbidities and (2) psycho/-social factors.","output":"Risk of hematoma after hemithyroidectomy in an outpatient setting: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has profoundly impacted medical practitioners worldwide.

The aim of this study is to try to measure the long-term impact of this experience on the professional and life choices of the student participants. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed and distributed by email to all 19C29 years old participants in the experience. Responses were collected and analysed in a quantitative descriptive way and in a qualitative way using the knowledge, skills and attitudes model. RESULTS: One hundred and seven students responded from the total 763 questionnaires distributed.

Although the prevalence of HBoVs in humans has been studied in some regions, it has not been well addressed globally. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cross-reactivity of anti-VP2 antibodies was detected between HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 in mouse and human serum. The prevalence of specific anti-VP2 IgG antibodies against HBoV1-4 was determined in different age groups of healthy individuals aged 0-70 years old in Beijing, China, using a competition ELISA assay based on virus-like particles of HBoV1-4. The seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 50%, 36.9%, 28.7%, and 0.8%, respectively, in children aged 0-14 years (n = 244); whereas the seroprevalence of HBoV1-4 was 66.9%, 49.3%, 38.7% and 1.4%, respectively, in healthy adults (15 years old; n = 142). The seropositive rate of HBoV1 was higher than that of HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 in individuals older than 0.5 years.

We used a branching process model to derive the final size distribution of minor outbreaks, assuming a reproduction number above unity, and applying the method to final size data for pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is a rare disease with only one documented major epidemic in a spatially limited setting. Because the final size distribution of a minor outbreak needs to be normalized by the probability of extinction, we assume that the dispersion parameter (k) of the negative-binomial offspring distribution is known, and examine the sensitivity of the reproduction number to variation in dispersion. Assuming a geometric offspring distribution with k = 1, the reproduction number was estimated at 1.16 (95% confidence interval: 0.97C1.38). When less dispersed with k = 2, the maximum likelihood estimate of the reproduction number was 1.14. These estimates agreed with those published from transmission network analysis, indicating that the human-to-human transmission potential of the pneumonic plague is not very high. Given only minor outbreaks, transmission potential is not sufficiently assessed by directly counting the number of offspring. Since the absence of a major epidemic does not guarantee a subcritical process, the proposed method allows us to conservatively regard epidemic data from minor outbreaks as supercritical, and yield estimates of threshold values above unity.","output":"Estimating the transmission potential of supercritical processes based on the final size distribution of minor outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data-driven programming hints are a scalable way to support students when they are stuck by automatically offering suggestions and identifying errors.

This study presents our experience of outcomes of emergency appendectomies performed during the pandemic. Methods - Prospectively we collected data on 132 patients in peak pandemic period from 1st March to 5th June 2020 and data compared with 206 patients operated in similar period in 2019. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, pre-operative events, investigations, surgical management, postoperative outcomes and complications were analysed.

Rats were randomly assigned into three target dosing groups, lower dose (80-90 mg/kg), higher dose (110-140 mg/kg) or ethanol vehicle only. A toxicology profile including behavioral and weight monitoring, full blood count, biochemistry, necropsy and histological examination of the lungs was conducted. The pharmacokinetic profile of ivermectin in plasma and lungs was determined in all animals. There were no relevant changes in behavior or body weight. There was a delayed elevation in muscle enzymes compatible with rhabdomyolysis, that was also seen in the control group and has been attributed to the ethanol dose which was up to 11 g/kg in some animals. There were no histological anomalies in the lungs of any rat. Male animals received a higher ivermectin dose adjusted by adipose weight and reached higher plasma concentrations than females in the same dosing group (mean Cmax 86.2 ng/ml vs. 26.2 ng/ml in the lower dose group and 152 ng/ml vs. 51.8 ng/ml in the higher dose group). All subjects had detectable ivermectin concentrations in the lungs at seven days post intervention, up to 524.3 ng/g for high-dose male and 27.3 ng/g for low-dose females. nebulized ivermectin can reach pharmacodynamic concentrations in the lung tissue of rats, additional experiments are required to assess the safety of this formulation in larger animals.","output":"Nebulized ivermectin for COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, a proof of concept, dose-ranging study in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe pneumonia is pathological manifestation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), however complications have been reported in COVID-19 patients with a worst prognosis Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection Methods: we retrospectively analyzed hs-TnI values measured in 523 patients (median age 64 years, 68% men) admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy, and diagnosed COVID-19 Results: A significant difference in hs-TnI concentrations was found between deceased patients (98 patients) vs discharged (425 patients) [36 05 ng/L IQR 16 5-94 9 vs 6 3 ng/L IQR 2 6-13 9, p &lt; 0 001 respectively] Hs-TnI measurements were independent predictors of mortality at multivariate analysis adjusted for confounding parameters such as age (HR 1 004 for each 10 point of troponin, 95% CI 1 002-1 006, p &lt; 0 001) The survival rate, after one week, in patients with hs-TnI values under 6 ng/L was 97 94%, between 6 ng/L and the normal value was 90 87%, between the normal value and 40 ng/L was 86 98, and 59 27% over 40 ng/L Conclusion: Increase of hs-TnI associated with elevated mortality in patients with COVID-19 Troponin shows to be a useful biomarker of disease progression and worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients","output":"Association between Cardiac Troponin I and Mortality in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fundaci ACE is a non-profit organization providing care based on a holistic model to persons with cognitive disorders and their families for 25 years in Barcelona, Spain. Delivering care to this vulnerable population amidst the COVID-19 pandemic has represented a major challenge to our institution. OBJECTIVE: To share our experience in adapting our model of care to the new situation to ensure continuity of care. METHODS: We detail the sequence of events and the actions taken within Fundaci ACE to swiftly adapt our face-to-face model of care to one based on telemedicine consultations. We characterize individuals under follow-up by the Memory Unit from 2017 to 2019 and compare the number of weekly visits in 2020 performed before and after the lockdown was imposed. RESULTS: The total number of individuals being actively followed by Fundaci ACE Memory Unit grew from 6,928 in 2017 to 8,147 in 2019. Among those newly diagnosed in 2019, most patients had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia (42% and 25%, respectively). Weekly visits dropped by 60% following the suspension of face-to-face activity. However, by April 24 we were able to perform 78% of the visits we averaged in the weeks before confinement began. DISCUSSION: We have shown that Fundaci ACE model of care has been able to successfully adapt to a health and social critical situation as COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we were able to guarantee the continuity of care while preserving the safety of patients, families, and professionals. We also seized the opportunity to improve our model of care.","output":"Dementia Care in Times of COVID-19: Experience at Fundaci ACE in Barcelona, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modern-era largely depends on Deep Learning (DL) in a lot of applications. Medical Images Diagnosis is one of the important fields nowadays because it is related to human life. But this DL requires large datasets as well as powerful computing resources. At the beginning of 2020, the world faced a new pandemic called COVID-19. Since it is new, shortage of reliable datasets of a running pandemic is a common phenomenon. One of the best solutions to mitigate this shortage is taking advantage of Deep Transfer Learning (DTL). DTL would be useful because it learns from one task and could work on another task with a smaller amount of dataset. This paper aims to examine the application of the transferred VGG-19 to solve the problem of COVID-19 detection from a chest x-ray. Different scenarios of the VGG-19 have been examined, including shallow model, medium model, and deep model. The main advantages of this work are two folds: COVID-19 patient can be detected with a small number of data sets, and the complexity of VGG-19 can be reduced by reducing the number of layers, which consequently reduces the training time. To assess the performance of these architectures, 2159 chest x-ray images were employed. Reported results indicated that the best recognition rate was achieved from a shallow model with 95% accuracy while the medium model and deep model obtained 94% and 75%, respectively. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Study of VGG-19 Depth in Transfer Learning for COVID-19 X-Ray Image Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 1877, the major towns of the Straits Settlements-Singapore, George Town, Penang Island and Malacca-suffered a drought of exceptional magnitude. The drought's natural instigator was the El Ni?o phase of the El Ni?o Southern Oscillation, a climatic phenomenon then not understood by contemporary observers. The 1877 event has been explored in some depth for countries including India, China and Australia. Its impact on Southeast Asia however is less well-known and the story of how the event unfolded in Singapore and Malaysia has not been told. This paper explores how the contemporary British government responded to the drought, arguing that its impact on hydraulic management was at best minimal yet, it did have impact on other areas, such as forest reservation with the hope of preserving future rainfall. It also highlights how, in contrast to studies on urban water plans in other British Asian colonies, the colonial authorities in the Straits Settlements had a far less coherent and meaningful relationship with water in their town planning schemes.

Initiatives aimed at staff and patients have been introduced at many hospitals to try and reduce and solve this issue. Aim This investigation aimed to evaluate the impact of a quality improvement programme on denture loss at an acute hospital, including the reasons dentures were reported as lost or broken and who reported them. Method Information on dentures which were lost or broken was collected in an acute hospital between 2016-2021 and included the number of losses, the reason for the loss/breakage and who reported them. The number of complaints and financial reimbursement related to denture loss was also obtained from the trust for the same period. Results In total, 123 dentures were reported as lost or broken between 2016-2021. The most commonly reported reasons for loss were patient transfers between wards, being left on hospital trays, or when patients were sleeping. Patients or carers are more likely to report a lost denture compared to hospital staff. Reimbursement paid by the trust for denture incidents is much lower than the numbers reported. Conclusion Creating a single reporting pathway for denture loss and implementing methods to reduce denture loss led to an increase in the numbers of dentures reported as lost. This is likely to be attributed to an increased awareness of reporting pathways. Denture loss is a significant financial burden to the NHS, in addition to causing patients and families distress and is most likely under-reported in many hospitals.","output":"The impact of a quality improvement initiative to reduce denture loss in an acute hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Beyond sex, age, and various comorbidities, geographical origin and socio-economic deprivation are associated with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) morbidity and mortality in the general population. We aimed to assess factors associated with severe forms of COVID-19 after a hospital emergency department visit, focusing on socio-economic factors. Methods: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 attending the emergency department of Bclre Hospital (France) in March-April 2020 were included. Postal addresses were used to obtain two geographical deprivation indices at the neighborhood level. Factors associated with hospitalization and factors associated with adverse outcomes, i.e. mechanical ventilation or death, were studied using logistic and Cox analyses, respectively. Results: Among 399 included patients, 321 were hospitalized. Neither geographical origin nor socio-economic deprivation was associated with any of the outcomes. Being male, older, overweight or obese, diabetic, or having a neuropsychiatric disorder were independent risk factors for hospitalization. Among 296 patients hospitalized at Bclre Hospital, 91 experienced an adverse outcome. Older age, being overweight or obese, desaturation and extent of chest CT scan lesions >25% at admission (aHR 2.2 [95%CI, 1.3-3.5]) and higher peak CRP levels and acute kidney failure (aHR 2.0 [1.2-3.3]) during follow-up were independently associated with adverse outcomes, whereas treatment with hydrocortisone reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation or death by half (aHR 0.5 [0.3-0.8]). Conclusion: No association between geographical origin or socio-economic deprivation and the occurrence of a severe form of COVID-19 was observed in our population after arrival to the emergency department.

METHODS: In total, 7,706 pancreatoduodenectomies performed at 18 international institutions composing the Pancreas Fistula Study Group were examined (2003-2020). High estimated blood loss (>700 mL) was defined as twice the median. Propensity score matching (1:1 exact-match) was employed to adjust for variables associated with high estimated blood loss and clinically relevant pancreatic fistula occurrence. The study was powered to detect a 33% clinically relevant pancreatic fistula increase in the high estimated blood loss group, with &#945; = 0.05 and ? = 0.2. RESULTS: The propensity score model included 966 patients with high estimated blood loss and 966 patients with lower estimated blood loss; all covariate imbalantces were solved. Patients with high estimated blood loss patients experienced higher clinically relevant pancreatic fistula rates (19.4 vs 12.6%, odds ratio 1.66; P < .001), as well as higher severe complication rates (27.8 vs 15.6%), transfusions (50.1 vs 14.3%), reoperations (9.2 vs 4.0%), intensive care unit transfers (9.9 vs 4.8%) and 90-day mortality (4.7 vs 2.0%, all P < .001). High estimated blood loss was an independent predictor for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.37-2.32), as were prophylactic Octreotide administration (odds ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.46-2.61) and soft pancreatic texture (odds ratio 5.32, 95% confidence interval 3.74-5.57; all P < .001). Moreover, a second model including 1,126 pancreatoduodenectomies was derived including vascular resections as additional confounder (14.0% vascular resections performed in each group). On multivariable regression, high estimated blood loss was confirmed an independent predictor for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula reduction (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.32-2.44; P < .001), whereas vascular resection was not (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.34-1.88; P = .156). CONCLUSION: This study better establishes the relationship between estimated blood loss and outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy. Despite inherent contributions to blood loss, its minimization is an actionable opportunity for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula reduction and performance optimization in pancreatoduodenectomy. Accordingly, practical insights are offered to achieve this goal.","output":"The effect of high intraoperative blood loss on pancreatic fistula development after pancreatoduodenectomy: An international, multi-institutional propensity score matched analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many people worldwide have been at home for months and practicing social distancing to mitigate the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). What may have started as a single case is now in at least 180 countries. Preliminary surveys indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused people to feel more lonely and isolated than they did before. It may be due to the fear of the virus, death of loved ones, and the lock-downs restrictions imposed in some countries.

However, when COVID-19 was first detected in Singapore in January 2020, the 12-h shift was introduced for better team segregation and deployment to meet the service needs of the Emergency Department. The 12-h shift consisted of the day (9am-9pm) and night (9pm-9am) shifts. While the 12-h shift is common to nursing practices, it is new to the radiography profession within the study centre. This study explores the radiographers' perspectives of the new shift and the impact of shift patterns on radiographers' wellness and work performance compared to the original three shift patterns. METHODS: A mixed-methods design study was adopted for this single-centre evaluation. An anonymous online questionnaire was administered to radiographers who had experienced both shift types. Additionally, the number of radiographers who had taken sick leave, and images rejected and accepted from the X-ray consoles were retrospectively collected to measure the impact of the new shift. RESULTS: Radiographers experienced fatigue and appreciated the longer rest days associated with the 12-h shift. Additionally, the sick leave rates and image reject counts were more favourable with the 12-h shift pattern. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the extended shift hours are effective during a pandemic but may result in radiographer burnout during a prolonged outbreak.

METHODS: The participants were ten adolescents between 12 and 17 years old (4 female and 6 male), users of protection programs in Chile. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, using thematic narrative analysis afterward.

The narratives of the adolescents indicate that they face not only specific episodes of IPV but also the consequences and family dynamics that accompany this type of violence. CONCLUSION: Adolescents coping strategies can be organized in a continuum of IPV integration-distancing, based on the degree and form of involvement in the experience.

We hypothesized that fewer patients administered this combination would require oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or a combination of both than those who did not. METHODS: This was a cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19 in a tertiary academic hospital. Before April 6, 2020, no patients received the (DMB) combination. After this date, patients were administered 1000 IU/d oral vitamin D3, 150 mg/d oral magnesium, and 500 mcg/d oral vitamin B12 upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration leading to any form of oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both. RESULTS: Between January 15 and April 15, 2020, we identified 43 consecutive patients &#8805;50 y of age with COVID-19. Seventeen patients received DMB before onset of primary outcome and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups were significantly different by age. In univariate analysis, age and hypertension had a significant influence on outcome. After adjusting for age or hypertension separately in a multivariate analysis, the intervention group retained protective significance. Fewer treated patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy during hospitalization (17.6 vs 61.5%, P = 0.006).

DesignSelf-controlled case series. SettingNational, linked electronic health record data in England. Study populationIndividuals aged 12-29 who had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination and died between 8 December 2020 and 2 February 2022 and registered by 16 February 2022 within 12 weeks of COVID-19 vaccination; Individuals aged 12-29 who died within 12 weeks of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Main outcome measuresCardiac and all-cause deaths occurring within 12 weeks of vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. ResultsCompared to the baseline period, there was no evidence of a change in the incidence of cardiac death in the six weeks after vaccination, whether for each of weeks 1 to 6 or the whole six-week period. There was a decrease in the risk of all-cause death in the first week after vaccination and no change in each of weeks 2 to 6 after vaccination or whole six-week period after vaccination. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, vaccine type, and last dose also showed no change in the risk of death in the first six weeks after vaccination. There was a large increase in the incidence of cardiac and all-cause death in the overall risk period after SARS-CoV-2 infection among the unvaccinated. ConclusionThere is no evidence of an association between COVID-19 vaccination and an increased risk of death in young people. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with substantially higher risk of cardiac related death and all-cause death. What is already known on this topicSeveral studies have highlighted the association between COVID-19 vaccination and the risk of myocarditis, myopericarditis, and other cardiac problems, especially in young people, but associated risk of mortality is unclear. Since younger people have lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality, the mortality risk associated with vaccination is potentially more important to them in balancing the risk and benefit of vaccination. What this study addsAlthough there is a risk of myocarditis or myopericarditis with COVID-19, there is no evidence of increased risk of cardiac or all-cause mortality following COVID-19 vaccination in young people aged 12 to 29. Given the increased risk of mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection in this group, the risk-benefit analysis favours COVID-19 vaccination for this age group.","output":"Risk of death following SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination in young people in England: a self-controlled case series study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conventional methods for quantifying and phenotyping antigen-specific lymphocytes can rapidly deplete irreplaceable specimens.

Metabolomics, the quantitative study of small organic compounds, called metabolites, in a biological specimen, is gaining more and more importance in nephrology research. Conducting a metabolomics study in human kidney disease cohorts, however, requires thorough knowledge about the key workflow steps: study planning, sample collection, metabolomics data acquisition and preprocessing, statistical/bioinformatics data analysis, and results interpretation within a biomedical context. This review provides a guide for future metabolomics studies in human kidney disease cohorts. We will offer an overview of important a priori considerations for metabolomics cohort studies, available analytical as well as statistical/bioinformatics data analysis techniques, and subsequent interpretation of metabolic findings.

Despite all the precautions taken, the pandemic attack continues and the rapid increase in the number of deaths suggest that this virus has entered the cell through different pathways and caused damage through different mechanisms. The main reason why the ACE2 pathway comes to the fore in all scientific studies is that this receptor is located at the entry point of basic mechanisms that provide alveolo-capillary homeostasis. SARS-CoV-2 has to use nuclear factor-B (NF-kB), caveloae, clathrin, lipoxin, serine protease and proteasome pathways in addition to ACE2 to enter the target cell and initiate damage. For this reason, while new drug development studies are continuing, in order to be beneficial to patients in their acute period, it is imperative that we are able to come up with drugs that activate or inhibit these pathways and are currently in clinical use. It is also critical that we adopt these new pathways to the treatment of pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2, based on the scientific data we use to treat the general population.","output":"Combating sars-cov-2 through lipoxins, proteasome, caveolin and nuclear factor-b pathways in non-pregnant and pregnant populations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Uterine rupture can be associated with severe maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Using hospital-based or mortality data, several COVID-19 risk factors have been identified, but these may be confounded or biased. METHODS: Using SARS-CoV-2 infection test data (n = 4509 tests; 1325 positive) from Public Health England, linked to the UK Biobank study, we explored the contribution of demographic, social, health risk, medical and environmental factors to COVID-19 risk. We used multivariable and penalized logistic regression models for the risk of (i) being tested, (ii) testing positive/negative in the study population and, adopting a test negative design, (iii) the risk of testing positive within the tested population. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, variables independently associated with the risk of being tested for COVID-19 with odds ratio >1.05 were: male sex; Black ethnicity; social disadvantage (as measured by education, housing and income); occupation (healthcare worker, retired, unemployed); ever smoker; severely obese; comorbidities; and greater exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 absorbance. Of these, only male sex, non-White ethnicity and lower educational attainment, and none of the comorbidities or health risk factors, were associated with testing positive among tested individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We adopted a careful and exhaustive approach within a large population-based cohort, which enabled us to triangulate evidence linking male sex, lower educational attainment and non-White ethnicity with the risk of COVID-19.

Although the placenta itself can be a target of virus infection, most neonates are virus free and are born healthy or recover quickly. Here, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the placenta from a cohort of women who were infected late during pregnancy and had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR at delivery. SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic RNA was detected in 23 out of 55 placentas (41%). Three placentas with high virus content were obtained from mothers who presented with severe COVID-19 and whose pregnancies resulted in adverse outcomes for the fetuses, including intrauterine fetal demise, stillbirth, and a preterm delivered baby still in newborn intensive care. Examination of the placental samples with high virus content showed efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection, using RNA in situ hybridization to detect genomic and replicating viral RNA, and immunohistochemistry to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Infection was restricted to syncytiotrophoblast cells that envelope the fetal chorionic villi and are in direct contact with maternal blood. The infected placentas displayed massive infiltration of maternal immune cells including macrophages into intervillous spaces, potentially contributing to inflammation of the tissue. Ex vivo infection of placental cultures with SARS-CoV-2 or with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein pseudotyped lentivirus targeted mostly syncytiotrophoblast and, to a lesser extent, endothelial cells. Infection was reduced by using blocking antibodies against ACE2 and against Neuropilin 1, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may utilize alternative receptors for entry into placental cells.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infects Syncytiotrophoblast and Activates Inflammatory Responses in the Placenta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionSince its early stages, the Covid-19 outbreak has posed immense challenges for effective, scalable and rapid interventions.

Inclusion criteria included studies clearly defining any use of telehealth services in all aspects of mental health care during COVID-19 outbreak, published from December 31, 2019 to October 31, 2020, written in English language and published in peer-reviewed journals. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarize the findings according a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis.Results62 studies met the inclusion out of the 278 search results. Data converged on: strengths in minimizing the risk of Covid-19 transmission, reduction of travel time and costs, comparable effectiveness to in-person care;weaknesses i.e. decreased ability to detect non-verbal cues, lower therapeutic alliance, possible technical connection problems;opportunities in improving the healthcare system and expanding its accessibility for patients also for the future;threats such as privacy and legal issues, and risk to overlook vulnerable populations (e.g. elderly, marginalized ethnic minorities).ConclusionsIn the midst of a global mental health emergency, telehealth may represent a virtually perfect solution.

While COVID-19 patients consistently generate a T lymphocyte response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, evidence of significant immune dysregulation in these patients continues to accumulate. In this study, next generation sequencing of the T cell receptor beta chain (TRB) repertoire was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients to determine if immunogenetic differences of the TRB repertoire contribute to disease course severity. Clustering of highly similar TRB CDR3 amino acid sequences across COVID-19 patients yielded 781 shared TRB sequences. The TRB sequences were then filtered for known associations with common diseases such as EBV and CMV. The remaining sequences were cross-referenced to a publicly accessible dataset that mapped COVID-19 specific TCRs to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We identified 158 SARS-CoV-2 specific TRB sequences belonging to 134 clusters in our COVID-19 patients. Next, we investigated 113 SARS-CoV-2 specific clusters binding only one peptide target in relation to disease course. Distinct skewing of SARS-CoV-2 specific TRB sequences toward the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) encoded within ORF1a/b of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was observed in clusters associated with critical disease course when compared to COVID-19 clusters associated with a severe disease course. These data imply that T-lymphocyte reactivity towards peptides from NSPs of SARS-CoV-2 may not constitute an effective adaptive immune response and thus may negatively affect disease severity.","output":"TRB sequences targeting ORF1a/b are associated with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: India has been reporting the cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since January 30, 2020. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) formulated and established laboratory surveillance for COVID-19. In this study, an analysis of the surveillance data was done to describe the testing performance and descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 cases by time, place and person. METHODS: The data were extracted from January 22 to April 30, 2020. The frequencies of testing performance were described over time and by place. We described cases by time (epidemic curve by date of specimen collection; seven-day moving average), place (area map) and person (attack rate by age, sex and contact status), and trends were represented along with public health measures and events. RESULTS: Between January 22 and April 30, 2020, a total of 1,021,518 individuals were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing increased from about 250 individuals per day in the beginning of March to 50,000 specimens per day by the end of April 2020. Overall, 40,184 (3.9%) tests were reported positive. The proportion of positive cases was highest among symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts, 2-3-fold higher than among those with severe acute respiratory infection, or those with an international travel history or healthcare workers. The attack rate (per million) by age was highest among those aged 50-69 yr (63.3) and was lowest among those under 10 yr (6.1). The attack rate was higher among males (41.6) than females (24.3). The secondary attack rate was 6.0 per cent. Overall, 99.0 per cent of 736 districts reported testing and 71.1 per cent reported COVID-19 cases. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The coverage and frequency of ICMR's laboratory surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 improved over time. COVID-19 was reported from most parts of India, and the attack rate was more among men and the elderly and common among close contacts. Analysis of the data indicates that for further insight, additional surveillance tools and strategies at the national and sub-national levels are needed.","output":"Laboratory surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in India: Performance of testing & descriptive epidemiology of detected COVID-19, January 22 - April 30, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data from a single state indicated there was an increase in opioid overdose related emergency services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As a consequence of the lockdown, many businesses shutdown and effectively had no source of revenue. Yet, without receiving any bailout or palliatives from the government, these businesses are required to meet their tax obligations to the government. Bearing in mind that this time (COVID-19 era) is different, one wonders what is required of businesses in view of the taxation problem and the social contract between the businesspersons and the government. In view of social contract obligations, in this COVID-19 pandemic should businesses pay tax to a government that seems to have delegitimised itself by its exploitative actions in terms of taxation and delinquent omission in terms of the provision of public goods and social services? The Nigerian government at all tiers (federal, state and local) seldom respect the essence of taxation. Therefore, businesses often pay tax for nothing. For many businesses, as far as taxation is concerned, to pay or not to pay? that is the question. This article is aimed at teasing out this taxation problem that may or may not be a moral dilemma. In view of certain ethical considerations, this article shows why in spite of social contract obligations, there is no consensus or canonical agreement on whether, as law-abiding citizens and juridical persons (legal entities), businesspersons and businesses ought to or ought not to pay tax to the Nigerian government in this COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Taxation in the COVID-19 Pandemic: to Pay or Not to Pay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Limited evidence exists for healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs associated with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG), a rare autoimmune disorder, for adults in the United States. METHODS: Adults with 1 diagnostic claim for MG between 2014 and 2019 were identified using Symphony Health's Integrated Dataverse?. Using a novel algorithm, HCRU and costs over 12 months following index dates were evaluated for patients with gMG including those with exacerbation events. For patients who experienced crisis events, HCRU and costs were analyzed during the 36 months preceding, during, and 12 months following the events. RESULTS: Mean HCRU and costs were higher for newly diagnosed patients compared with previously diagnosed patients (hospitalizations: 0.46 vs. 0.34; all-cause costs: $26,419.20 vs. $24,941.47; direct costs for gMG treatments: $9,890.37 vs. $9,186.47) and further increased for patients with exacerbation events (hospitalizations: 0.72; all-cause costs: $43,734.15; direct costs for gMG treatments: $21,550.02). For patients who experienced crisis events, HCRU and costs markedly increased during the 12 months immediately before the crisis event (hospitalizations: 1.35; all-cause costs: $49,236.68) compared with the 2 preceding years and increased further during the 12 months following the crisis index date (hospitalizations: 2.78; all-cause costs: $173,956.99). Cost increases were, in large part, attributed to treatments received. DISCUSSION: New diagnosis, exacerbation, and crisis events were drivers of HCRU and cost for patients with gMG. Particularly, high costs of gMG-specific medications associated with intervention for exacerbation and crisis events contributed to increased all-cause costs.","output":"Real-World Healthcare Resource Utilization and Cost Burden Assessment for Adults With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Arab countries account for almost 6% of the global population, yet they make up only 5% of the total cases and less than 3% of the global death toll attributed to COVID-19 COVID-19 has put the health systems in the various Arab Countries and their ability to deliver healthcare services under tremendous strain The capacity and stability of any health system is important in any type of response to the pandemic, in order to ensure an effective and efficient delivery of care to the public through COVID-19 and beyond The objective of this study is to identify the various response of health systems in Arab Countries to COVID-19, and highlight the legal and health challenges faced during the pandemic The study identified both gaps and good practices that may be utilized in order to guide the efforts in response to COVID-19 and the recovery efforts once the pandemic is over Methods: To determine why the response of some health systems in Arab Countries responses are more effective than others, a three-step framework is adopted which includes, detection, containment, and treatment stages In order to identify which countries are excelling at detection, containment, and treatment stages, several indicators were selected for each stage To be able to understand the legal and health challenges of response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an analysis of the health systems, the resources in terms of quality and access, health workforce, and finance was conducted Secondary data published by the Global Burden of Disease Study, and the Global Change Data Lab of the University of Oxford was used to study identified gaps and good practices to guide the responses to COVID-19 and recovery efforts once the pandemic is over Results: The epidemiologic record demonstrates that that certain Arab countries are managing to control the pandemic, through a combination of mitigation strategies, suppression strategy and elimination strategy There are several barriers and challenges in Arab health systems which have been amplified due to COVID-19 and if ignored may pose a further significant challenge in the future Health systems in Arab countries are not sufficiently equipped to handle all healthcare needs related to COVID-19, in particular issues relating to administration, equity, finances, the supply side of healthcare, and usage of information technology Conclusion: In Arab counties, the standard response to COVID-19 was enforced by new health laws, which consist of a combination of the traditional disease control measures (testing, contact-tracing, social distancing), population-based physical distancing (including stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, and social gathering bans), travel limits (including travel bans, and border closures), and economic support measures Acceptable healthcare quality and access, sufficient health workforce, and sufficient funds are the most imperative needs in the health system in Arab counties to provide a sustainable response to the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Legal and Health Response to COVID-19 in the Arab Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden deterioration of patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into critical illness is of major concern.

Such panic can be ascribed to the seemingly deceptive features of COVID-19: Compared to other deadly viral outbreaks, it has medium transmission and mortality rates. As a result, the severity of the causative coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was deeply underestimated by society at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on this, in this review, we define the viruses with features similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 as the Panic Zone viruses. To contain those viruses, accurate and fast diagnosis followed by effective isolation and treatment of patients are pivotal at the early stage of virus breakouts. This is especially true when there is no cure or vaccine available for a transmissible disease, which is the case for the current COVID-19 pandemic. As of July 2020, more than 100 kits for COVID-19 diagnosis on the market have been surveyed in this review, while emerging sensing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed. It is of critical importance to rationally use these kits for efficient management and control of the Panic Zone viruses. Therefore, we discuss guidelines to select diagnostic kits at different outbreak stages of the Panic Zone viruses, SARS-CoV-2 in particular. While it is of utmost importance to use nucleic acid based detection kits with low false negativity (high sensitivity) at the early stage of an outbreak, the low false positivity (high specificity) gains importance at later stages of the outbreak. When society is set to reopen from the lockdown stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critical to have immunoassay based kits with high specificity to identify people who can safely return to society after their recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Finally, since a massive attack from a viral pandemic requires a massive defense from the whole society, we urge both government and the private sector to research and develop affordable and reliable point-of-care testing (POCT) kits, which can be used massively by the general public (and therefore called massive POCT) to contain Panic Zone viruses in the future.","output":"Detecting the Coronavirus (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not availble.","output":"The seXY side of COVID-19: what is behind female protection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This compilation accounts the efforts made to characterize the proteomes of lung tissues in health and disease and to recognize proteomic patterns of diseased states in the patient's biological fluids/secretions and lavage fluids.

Leucocyte classification, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected by full-automatic blood cell analyzer and flow cytometer, respectively. RESULTS: Upon admission, eosinophils and lymphocyte subsets decreased significantly, while neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-?3 increased significantly in COVID-19 patients compared to HCs. CD3+ T and DN (CD3+CD4-CD8-) cells appeared sustained decline, leucocytes, neutrophils and IL-10 showed sustained increase in severe group compared to mild group. Compared with the non-infection group, we observed a depletion of eosinophils, CD3+ T and CD4+ T cells, but leucocytes, neutrophils, IL-6 and IL-10 on the contrary in the infection group. Besides, in severe group of COVID-19 patients, DN cells were negatively correlated with IL-10, and DP (CD3+CD4+CD8+) cells were negatively correlated with IL-6.

The central reactions of H2 production and homoacetogenesis are catalyzed by enzyme hydrogenase and the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, respectively. In this work, genes encoding for the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (fthfs) and hydrogenase (hydA) were used to investigate the diversity of homoacetogens as well as their phylogenetic relationships through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and next-generation amplicon sequencing. A total of 70 samples from 19 different H2-producing bioreactors with different configurations and operating conditions were analyzed. Quantification through qPCR showed that the abundance of fthfs and hydA was strongly associated with the type of substrate, organic loading rate, and H2 production performance. In particular, fthfs sequencing revealed that homoacetogens diversity was low with one or two dominant homoacetogens in each sample. Clostridium carboxivorans was detected in the reactors fed with agave hydrolisates; Acetobacterium woodii dominated in systems fed with glucose; Blautia coccoides and unclassified Sporoanaerobacter species were present in reactors fed with cheese whey; finally, Eubacterium limosum and Selenomonas sp. were co-dominant in reactors fed with glycerol. Altogether, quantification and sequencing analysis revealed that the occurrence of homoacetogenesis could take place due to (1) metabolic changes of H2-producing bacteria towards homoacetogenesis or (2) the displacement of H2-producing bacteria by homoacetogens.

Non-invasive scores such, as aspartate transaminase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index, platelet: spleen (PS) ratio were correlated between the two techniques. RESULTS: OV grading between endoscopists and radiologists showed 81.73% agreement (85 out of 104 patients) in the comparative analysis of 104 cirrhotic patients, of which no varices (57.1%, n=4), small (85.1%, n=23), medium (72.2%%, n=26), and large varices (94.1%, n=32) with a weighted k score of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.94). Overall, the sensitivity of CT in the diagnosis of no, small, medium, and large OVs was 66.6%, 79.3%, 89.6%, and 94.1%, respectively, with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) score of 0.775, 0.887, 0.839, and 0.914. Performance of APRI, FIB-4, and PS ratio correlated well with the severity of OVs with no difference between OGD and CT grading. CONCLUSION: Triphasic abdominal CT can be an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and grading of OVs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Optimal diagnostic tool for surveillance of oesophageal varices during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have included lockdowns and social distancing with considerable disruptions to the lives of people. These changes may have particularly impacted on those with mental health problems, leading to a worsening of inequalities in the behaviours which influence health. Methods: We used data from four national longitudinal British cohort studies (N=10,666). Respondents reported mental health (psychological distress and anxiety/depression symptoms) and health behaviours (alcohol, diet, physical activity, and sleep) before and during the pandemic. Associations between pre-pandemic mental ill-health and pandemic mental ill-health and health behaviours were examined using logistic regression; pooled effects were estimated using meta-analysis. Results: Worse mental health was related to adverse health behaviours; effect sizes were largest for sleep, exercise and diet, and weaker for alcohol. The associations between poor mental health and adverse health behaviours were larger during the May lockdown than pre-pandemic. In September, when restrictions had eased, inequalities had largely reverted to pre-pandemic levels. A notable exception was for sleep, where differences by mental health status remained high. Risk differences for adverse sleep for those with the highest level of prior mental ill-health compared to those with the lowest, were 21.2% (95% CI: 16.2, 26.2) before lockdown, 25.5% (20.0, 30.3) in May, and 28.2% (21.2, 35.2) in September. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggest that mental health is an increasingly important factor in health behaviour inequality in the COVID era. The promotion of mental health may thus be an important component of improving post-COVID population health.","output":"Mental health in relation to changes in sleep, exercise, alcohol and diet during the COVID-19 pandemic: examination of five UK cohort studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the pillars of efforts in the US to curb HIV incidence is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We examined racial/ethnic and sex disparities in PrEP uptake among California Medicaid enrollees.

We then predicted age-adjusted uptake rates from multivariable logit regressions and divided PrEP uptake estimates by each group's number of new HIV diagnoses to estimate PrEP-to-need ratios. Predicted uptake was highest for White (0.29 percent) and Black (0.23 percent) males and lowest (0.16 percent) for Hispanic males. Rates for males exceeded those for females; however, Black females had twice the rate of PrEP uptake of White females. Black males and females and Hispanic males had PrEP-to-need ratios that were less than one-third (4.0-6.3) those of Asian and White males and females (14.4-19.9).

An interesting and relatively unexplored research topic concerns the associations between economic stress and employee job outcomes such as innovative behaviors, indispensable for business survival. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between economic stress, absenteeism and innovation. We considered both a direct and a mediation hypothesis and hypothesized that economic stress can have a negative influence on innovation directly and indirectly through increased absenteeism. A cross-sectional study was performed during 2018 and 2019 in an Italian food factory. A sample of 578 employees completed the Stress Questionnaire, the Janssens nine-item scale and a single-item regarding absenteeism. All relationships are supported by empirical data. As expected, the results indicated that economic stress is negatively related to innovation and positively related to absenteeism, which, in turn, plays a mediating role in the relationship between economic stress and innovative behavior. Herewith, those employees with higher levels of economic stress show higher levels of absenteeism contributing at the same time to a decrease in innovative behaviors. These findings show the importance of economic stress in understanding individual work outcomes and highlight the need to promote adequate intervention programs.","output":"Economic Stress at Work: Its Impact over Absenteeism and Innovation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viromea part of a microbiomeis a term used to describe all viruses found in the specific organism or system.

However, the continuous flow pattern in FCV during inspiration and expiration has a significant impact on respiratory parameters and ventilatory settings compared to conventional ventilation modes. In addition, the constant flow combined with direct intratracheal pressure measurement allows determination of dynamic compliance and ventilation settings can be adjusted accordingly, reflecting a personalized ventilation approach. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year old women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was admitted to a tertiary medical center. Initial ventilation occurred with best standard of care pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and was then switched to FCV, by adopting PCV ventilator settings. This led to an increase in oxygenation by 30 %. Subsequently, to reduce invasiveness of mechanical ventilation, FCV was individualized by dynamic compliance guided adjustment of both, positive end-expiratory pressure and peak pressure; this intervention reduced driving pressure from 18 to 12 cm H2O. However, after several hours, compliance further deteriorated which resulted in a tidal volume of only 4.7 ml/kg. CONCLUSIONS: An individualized FCV approach increased oxygenation parameters in a patient suffering from severe COVID-19 related ARDS. Direct intratracheal pressure measurements allow for determination of dynamic compliance and thus optimization of ventilator settings, thereby reducing applied and dissipated energy. However, although desirable, this personalized ventilation strategy may reach its limits when lung function is so severely impaired that patient's oxygenation has to be ensured at the expense of lung protective ventilation concepts.","output":"A case report of individualized ventilation in a COVID-19 patient - new possibilities and caveats to consider with flow-controlled ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, for the second phase of prevention of the COVID-19 Pandemic, it is being assumed the use of an app for the prevention of infections COVID-19.

Mobile learning (m-learning) has been applied as the educational social platform within higher education institutes, public as well as private. The research hypotheses were associated with the Covid-19 influence on m-learning adoption with the rise of the coronavirus increasing types of fear. Such fears include fear caused by the education failure, family lockdown, and loss of social relationships. Teachers and students are mostly fearful of these aspects of the situation. An integrated model was established within the research, using theoretical models;the Planned Behavior theory, the Technology Acceptance Model, and the Expectation-Confirmation Model. The proposed integrated model (using PLS-SEM software) was analyzed using an online survey data, with 420 respondents from Zayed University, UAE. The findings indicated that attitude was the best predictor for using the m-learning system, followed by continuous intention, expectation confirmation, perceived usefulness, ease-of-use, perceived fear, behavioral control, and satisfaction. According to the research, during the coronavirus pandemic, if the m-learning system is adopted for educational reasons, the learning and teaching outcome proves quite promising. Yet there is a fear of the family being stressed, or of loss of friends, and also a fear of the results of future schooling.

The SARS-CoV-2 registry was cross-checked when this population was 11-12 years old. Through physical examinations at 4, 6 and 9 years of age, weight, height and waist circumference were obtained. The WHO-2007 criteria were used to classify general obesity (GO), and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria were used to classify abdominal obesity (AO). Using Poisson regression, the relative risks (RRs) of infection were estimated, adjusting for sociodemographic variables, physical activity and perceived health reported by the parents.Results: The accumulated incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 8.6% (95% CI: 7.3-9.8).

Throughout the decades, re-irradiation (re-RT) has achieved a prominent place in the treatment of recurrent gliomas. A solid body of evidence supports the safety and efficacy of re-RT, especially when modern techniques are used, and justifies the early use of this regimen, especially in the case when macroscopic disease is present. Additionally, a second adjuvant re-RT to the resection cavity is currently being investigated by several investigators and seems to offer promising results. Although advanced RT technologies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) have become available in many centers, re-RT should continue to be kept in experienced hands so that they can select the optimal regimen, the ideal treatment volume, and the appropriate techniques from their tool-boxes. Concomitant or adjuvant use of systemic treatment options should also strongly be taken into consideration, especially because temozolomide (TMZ), cyclohexyl-nitroso-urea (CCNU), and bevacizumab have shown a good safety profile; they should be considered, if available. Nonetheless, the selection of patients for re-RT remains crucial. Single factors, such as patient age or the progression-free interval (PFI), fall too short.

It remains unknown whether patients with COVID-19 and mental health disorders are at increased risk of mortality and should thus be targeted as a high-risk population for severe forms of COVID-19. Objective: To determine whether patients with mental health disorders were at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality compared with patients without mental health disorders. Data Sources: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to February 12, 2021. Bibliographies were also searched, and the corresponding authors were directly contacted. The search paradigm was based on the following combination: (mental, major[MeSH terms]) AND (COVID-19 mortality[MeSH terms]). To ensure exhaustivity, the term mental was replaced by psychiatric, schizophrenia, psychotic, bipolar disorder, mood disorders, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, personality disorder, eating disorder, alcohol abuse, alcohol misuse, substance abuse, and substance misuse. Study Selection: Eligible studies were population-based cohort studies of all patients with identified COVID-19 exploring the association between mental health disorders and mortality. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was used for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pooled crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the association of mental health disorders with mortality were calculated using a 3-level random-effects (study/country) approach with a hierarchical structure to assess effect size dependency. Results: In total, 16 population-based cohort studies (data from medico-administrative health or electronic/medical records databases) across 7 countries (1 from Denmark, 2 from France, 1 from Israel, 3 from South Korea, 1 from Spain, 1 from the UK, and 7 from the US) and 19 086 patients with mental health disorders were included. The studies covered December 2019 to July 2020, were of good quality, and no publication bias was identified. COVID-19 mortality was associated with an increased risk among patients with mental health disorders compared with patients without mental health disorders according to both pooled crude OR (1.75 [95% CI, 1.40-2.20]; P < .05) and adjusted OR (1.38 [95% CI, 1.15-1.65]; P < .05). The patients with severe mental health disorders had the highest ORs for risk of mortality (crude OR: 2.26 [95% CI, 1.18-4.31]; adjusted OR: 1.67 [95% CI, 1.02-2.73]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 observational studies in 7 countries, mental health disorders were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality.

This article reviews recent literature on the application of digital technology in movement disorders, with a focus on Parkinsons disease (PD) and Huntingtons disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research has demonstrated the ability for digital technology to discriminate between individuals with and without PD, identify those at high risk for PD, quantify specific motor features, predict clinical events in PD, inform clinical management, and generate novel insights. SUMMARY: Digital technology has enormous potential to transform clinical research and care in movement disorders. However, more work is needed to better validate existing digital measures, including in new populations, and to develop new more holistic digital measures that move beyond motor features.","output":"Digital Technology in Movement Disorders: Updates, Applications, and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continual growth of the use of technological appliances during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a massive volume of data flow on the Internet, as many employees have transitioned to working from home. Furthermore, with the increase in the adoption of encrypted data transmission by many people who tend to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Tor Browser (dark web) to keep their data privacy and hidden, network traffic encryption is rapidly becoming a universal approach. This affects and complicates the quality of service (QoS), traffic monitoring, and network security provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), particularly for analysis and anomaly detection approaches based on the network traffics nature. The method of categorizing encrypted traffic is one of the most challenging issues introduced by a VPN as a way to bypass censorship as well as gain access to geo-locked services. Therefore, an efficient approach is especially needed that enables the identification of encrypted network traffic data to extract and select valuable features which improve the quality of service and network management as well as to oversee the overall performance. In this paper, the classification of network traffic data in terms of VPN and non-VPN traffic is studied based on the efficiency of time-based features extracted from network packets. Therefore, this paper suggests two machine learning models that categorize network traffic into encrypted and non-encrypted traffic. The proposed models utilize statistical features (SF), Pearson Correlation (PC), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA), preprocessing the traffic samples into net flow traffic to accomplish the experiments objectives. The GA-based method utilizes a stochastic method based on natural genetics and biological evolution to extract essential features. The PC-based method performs well in removing different features of network traffic. With a microsecond per-packet prediction time, the best model achieved an accuracy of more than 95.02 percent in the most demanding traffic classification task, a drop in accuracy of only 2.37 percent in comparison to the entire statistical-based machine learning approach. This is extremely promising for the development of real-time traffic analyzers.","output":"VPN and Non-VPN Network Traffic Classification Using Time-Related Features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease may differ, most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients may develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or mechanical ventilatory support. In this study, we aimed to identify validity of our modified scoring system for foreseeing the approach to the COVID-19 patient and the disease, the treatment plan, the severity of morbidity and even the risk of mortality from the clinician's point of view. In this single center study, we examined the patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between 01/04/2020 and 01/06/2020, of the 228 patients who were between 20 and 90 years of age, and whose polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests of nasal and pharyngeal swab samples were positive. We evaulated 228 (92 male and 136 female) PCR (+) patients. Univariate analysis showed that advanced age (p < 0.001), hemoglobin (p < 0.001), troponin-I (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p < 0.001), HT (p = 0.01), CAD (p = 0.001), DM (p < 0.001), history of malignancy (p = 0.008), along with m-sPESI scores (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in patients that needed intensive care due to COVID-19 infection. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, only the m-sPESI score higher than  2 was found to be highly significant in terms of indicating the need for ICU admission (AUC 0.948; 84.6% sensitivity and 94.6% specificity) (p < 0.001). With an increasing number of hospitalized patients, healthcare providers are confronting a deluge of lab results in the process of caring for COVID-19 patients. It is imperative to identify risk factors for mortality and morbidity development. The modified sPESI scoring system, which we put forward, is successful in predicting the course of the disease at the presentation of the patient with COVID-19 disease and predicting the need for intensive care with high specificity and sensitivity, can detect the need for intensive care with high specificity and sensitivity.","output":"Can a modified-simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (m-sPESI) be used to predict the need for intensive care in hospitalized COVID-19 patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The emergence of a pandemic affecting the respiratory system can result in a significant demand for face masks. This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 m range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for particle sizes of <300 nm and >300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cottonCsilk, cottonCchiffon, cottonCflannel) was >80% (for particles <300 nm) and >90% (for particles >300 nm). We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of fit and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently. Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.","output":"Aerosol Filtration Efficiency of Common Fabrics Used in Respiratory Cloth Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to closures of university campuses around the world from March 2020 onwards.

Because of the coinciding silent epidemic of MDR organisms the handling of COVID-19 patients became even more challenging. In the present study, the microbiological characteristics of bacteraemias in confirmed cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were determined. Data from 1165 patients hospitalized between September and December 2020 were reviewed regarding the frequency of bloodstream infections, the epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the causative bacteria. The hospital's antibiotic susceptibility data for all major nosocomial pathogens isolated from bacteremias of COVID-19 patients between September-December 2020 versus September-December 2019 bacteremias were also compared. Overall, 122 patients developed bacteremia (10.47%). The average of time interval between hospitalization date and development of bacteremia was 13.98 days. Admission to ICU occurred in 98 out of 122 patients with an average time of stay 15.85 days and 90.81% in-hospital mortality. In total, 166 pathogens were recovered including 114 Gram-negative bacteria and 52 Gram-positive cocci.

The main symptoms of PD are movement disorders accompanied with deficiency of neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) in the striatum due to cell death of the nigrostriatal DA neurons. Two main histopathological hallmarks exist in PD: cytosolic inclusion bodies termed Lewy bodies that mainly consist of -synuclein protein, the oligomers of which produced by misfolding are regarded to be neurotoxic, causing DA cell death; and black pigments termed neuromelanin (NM) that are contained in DA neurons and markedly decrease in PD. The synthesis of human NM is regarded to be similar to that of melanin in melanocytes; melanin synthesis in skin is via DOPAquinone (DQ) by tyrosinase, whereas NM synthesis in DA neurons is via DAquinone (DAQ) by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). DA in cytoplasm is highly reactive and is assumed to be oxidized spontaneously or by an unidentified tyrosinase to DAQ and then, synthesized to NM. Intracellular NM accumulation above a specific threshold has been reported to be associated with DA neuron death and PD phenotypes.

We examined whether adipocytes express ACE2 and its regulation by manipulation of the RAS and by high-fat (HF) feeding. ACE2 mRNA expression increased (threefold) during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and was not regulated by manipulation of the RAS. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed low- (LF) or high-fat (HF) diets for 1 wk or 4 mo. At 1 wk of HF feeding, adipose expression of angiotensinogen (twofold) and ACE2 (threefold) increased, but systemic angiotensin peptide concentrations and blood pressure were not altered. At 4 mo of HF feeding, adipose mRNA expression of angiotensinogen (twofold) and ACE2 (threefold) continued to be elevated, and liver angiotensinogen expression increased (twofold). However, adipose tissue from HF mice did not exhibit elevated ACE2 protein or activity. Increased expression of ADAM17, a protease responsible for ACE2 shedding, coincided with reductions in ACE2 activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and an ADAM17 inhibitor decreased media ACE2 activity. Moreover, ADAM17 mRNA expression was increased in adipose tissue from 4-mo HF-fed mice, and plasma ACE2 activity increased. However, HF mice exhibited marked increases in plasma angiotensin peptide concentrations (LF: 2,141 +/- 253; HF: 6,829 +/- 1,075 pg/ml) and elevated blood pressure.

In cellular networks, incorporation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can result in enhanced connectivity for outdoor users due to the high probability of establishing Line of Sight (LoS) links. The UAV's limited battery life and its signal attenuation in indoor areas, however, make it inefficient to manage users' requests in indoor environments. Referred to as the Cluster centric and Coded UAV-aided Femtocaching (CCUF) framework, the network's coverage in both indoor and outdoor environments increases via a two-phase clustering for FAPs' formation and UAVs' deployment. First objective is to increase the content diversity. In this context, we propose a coded content placement in a cluster-centric cellular network, which is integrated with the Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) to mitigate the inter-cell interference in edge areas. Then, we compute, experimentally, the number of coded contents to be stored in each caching node to increase the cache-hit ratio, Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and cache diversity and decrease the users' access delay and cache redundancy for different content popularity profiles. Capitalizing on clustering, our second objective is to assign the best caching node to indoor/outdoor users for managing their requests. In this regard, we define the movement speed of ground users as the decision metric of the transmission scheme for serving outdoor users' requests to avoid frequent handovers between FAPs and increase the battery life of UAVs. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed CCUF implementation increases the cache hit-ratio, SINR, and cache diversity and decrease the users' access delay, cache redundancy and UAVs' energy consumption.","output":"Joint Transmission Scheme and Coded Content Placement in Cluster-centric UAV-aided Cellular Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stone quarrying and crushing spits huge stone dust to the environment and causes threats to ecosystem components as well as human health Imposing emergency lockdown to stop infection of COVID 19 virus on 24 03 2020 in India has created economic crisis but it has facilitated environment to restore its quality Global scale study has already proved the qualitative improvement of air quality but its possible impact at regional level is not investigated yet Middle catchment of Dwarka river basin of Eastern India is well known for stone quarrying and crushing and therefore the region is highly polluted The present study has attempted to explore the impact of forced lockdown on environmental components like Particulate matter (PM) 10, Land surface temperature (LST), river water quality, noise using image and field derived data in pre and during lockdown periods Result clearly exhibits that Maximum PM(10) concentration was 189 to 278 g/m(3) in pre lockdown period and it now ranges from 50 to 60 g/m(3) after 18 days of the commencement of lockdown in selected four stone crushing clusters LST is reduced by 3C5 C, noise level is dropped to 65dBA which was above 85dBA in stone crusher dominated areas in pre lockdown period Adjacent river water is qualitatively improved due to stoppage of dust release to the river For instance, total dissolve solid (TDS) level in river water adjacent to crushing unit is attenuated by almost two times When entire world is worried about the appropriate policies for abating environmental pollution, this emergency lockdown shows an absolute way i e pollution source management may restore environment and ecosystem with very rapid rate","output":"COVID-19 pandemic persuaded lockdown effects on environment over stone quarrying and crushing areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a case of an abducens nerve palsy in a previously healthy young man in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this study, to help develop novel antiviral strategies, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy was applied to investigate viruses associated with SD. The results not only revealed the structure of mud crab dicistrovirus (MCDV) but also identified a novel mud crab tombus-like virus (MCTV) not previously detected using molecular biology methods. The structure of MCDV at a 3.5-? resolution reveals three major capsid proteins (VP1 to VP3) organized into a pseudo-T=3 icosahedral capsid, and affirms the existence of VP4. Unusually, MCDV VP3 contains a long C-terminal region and forms a novel protrusion that has not been observed in other dicistrovirus. Our results also reveal that MCDV can release its genome via conformation changes of the protrusions when viral mixtures are heated. The structure of MCTV at a 3.3-? resolution reveals a T= 3 icosahedral capsid with common features of both tombusviruses and nodaviruses. Furthermore, MCTV has a novel hydrophobic tunnel beneath the 5-fold vertex and 30 dimeric protrusions composed of the P-domains of the capsid protein at the 2-fold axes that are exposed on the virion surface. The structural features of MCTV are consistent with a novel type of virus.IMPORTANCE Pathogen identification is vital for unknown infectious outbreaks, especially for dual or multiple infections.

Since then, the country counts over 150000 deaths due to COVID-19 and faces a profound social and economic crisis; there is also an ongoing health catastrophe, with the majority of hospital beds in many Brazilian cities currently occupied with COVID-19 patients. Thus, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme used to plan appropriate social distancing measures (and relaxations) in order to mitigate the effects of this pandemic is formulated in this paper. The strategy is designed upon an adapted data-driven SusceptibleCInfectedCRecoveredCDeceased (SIRD) model, which includes time-varying auto-regressive immunological parameters. A novel identification procedure is proposed, composed of analytical regressions, Least-Squares optimization and auto-regressive model fits. The adapted SIRD model is validated with real data and able to adequately represent the contagion curves over large forecast horizons. The NMPC strategy is designed to generate piecewise constant quarantine guidelines, which can be reassessed (relaxed/strengthened) each week. Simulation results show that the proposed NMPC technique is able to mitigate the number of infections and progressively loosen social distancing measures. With respect to a no-control condition, the number of deaths could be reduced in up to 30% if the proposed NMPC coordinated health policy measures are enacted.","output":"A parametrized nonlinear predictive control strategy for relaxing COVID-19 social distancing measures in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to create an open access online radiology podcast to educate listeners at any time, from anywhere. To meet learner needs and improve the likelihood of successful implementation and utilization, we assessed radiology trainee attitudes and experiences of podcasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed an educational podcast, From the Viewbox, focused on evergreen themes and practical approaches to radiology. Content categories included Diagnostic Approach, Specific Imaging Diagnoses, Noninterpretive Skills, and Special Topics. We released and promoted episodes on multiple digital platforms. Radiology trainees were surveyed and data were analyzed to assess listener preferences and usage trends. RESULTS: Only 19% of our trainees had previously listened to a radiology podcast, yet 81% expressed interest in listening routinely. After initial release, 86% of trainees listened to the podcast and 62% listened routinely. Episodes gained the most plays immediately following release but retained and continued to attract more listeners. The most popular episode discussing COVID-19 diagnosis and imaging, emphasized the importance of selecting high yield content to match listener needs. Most trainees felt the podcast had \\"very high\\" or \\"high\\" value in educational value, accessibility, and time efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: From the Viewbox offers efficient and accessible audio-only learning modules that can be used independently or effectively paired with traditional resources to decrease barriers in radiology education and enhance learner productivity. Podcasting is an underutilized asynchronous remote learning tool that can help overcome current challenges of social distancing, and more importantly address the diverse preferences and needs of our learners.","output":"Radiology podcasting as a model for asynchronous remote learning in the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS An immobile vocal fold due to recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury usually shows no gross signs of atrophy and lies near the midline. In 1881, Felix Semon proposed that this phenomenon was due to a selective injury of nerve fibers supplying the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA) and supported this with postmortem proof of selective PCA atrophy. In recent decades, evidence has emerged that the RLN regenerates after injury but does not always result in useful motion of the vocal folds. It has been proposed that this is caused by laryngeal synkinesis. Laryngeal synkinesis describes a random distribution of regenerated nerve fibers to opposing vocal fold muscles. This study was conducted to clarify the relative contribution of these two potential pathomechanisms in our patient population. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case analysis. METHODS Retrospective analysis of laryngeal EMG results from cases with RLN paralysis of at least 6 months duration seen at our neurolaryngology clinic. RESULTS Out of 118 PCA EMGs, there was not a single normal or near-normal tracing, whilst 33.3% of TA EMGs indicated normal or near normal innervation. PCA EMGs showed signs of persistent high-grade partial denervation (41.5%) as a sign of atrophy, moderate or strong synkinesis (21.2%), or a combination of both (37.3%). CONCLUSIONS In chronic RLN paralysis the intrinsic laryngeal muscles are affected to different extents either by atrophy or synkinesis or a combination of both. The PCA is always affected. The lesser damage to TA innervation explains the commonly seen maintenance of vocal fold muscle bulk.

We estimate the impact that physical distancing (also known as social distancing)has had on the contact rate and examine the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We find that distancing has had a strong impact, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers. We estimate that approximately 0.78 (0.66-0.89 90% CI) of contacts have been removed for individuals in British Columbia practising physical distancing and that this fraction is above the threshold of 0.45 at which prevalence is expected to grow. However, relaxing distancing measures beyond this threshold re-starts rapid exponential growth. Because the extent of underestimation is unknown, the data are consistent with a wide range in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population; changes to testing criteria over time introduce additional uncertainty. Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures - if sufficiently strong and robustly followed - could control COVID-19 transmission, but that if distancing measures are relaxed too much, the epidemic curve would grow to high prevalence.","output":"Estimating the impact of COVID-19 control measures using a Bayesian model of physical distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The rs2234694 and 50 bp insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) polymorphisms of the SOD1 gene have been shown to be associated with many diseases, but in breast cancer (BC) their association has not been detected. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and association of SOD1 gene polymorphisms (rs2234694 and 50 bp Ins/Del) in BC patients in the Mexican population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SOD1 polymorphisms were determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in Mexican healthy subjects and BC patients. RESULTS: The rs2234694 polymorphism was associated with BC susceptibility when BC patients and the control group were compared for the AC genotype (p<0.0001), the AC/CC genotype (dominant model: p<0.0001), and the C allele (p<0.0001). The 50 bp Ins/Del polymorphism was associated with BC susceptibility for the Del allele (p=0.048), although the association between the dominant model AC/CC (rs2234694) and BC patients was evident for menopause [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.65 (95% CI 1.05-2.7); p=0.048], Ki-67 (&#8805;15%) (OR1.9, 95% CI 1.14- 3.16, p=0.016), and the presence of DM2 (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.35- 4.31, p=0.003).

It operates both as a ligand-gated cationic channel and as a metabotropic receptor in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. As protein phosphorylation is an important cell function regulatory mechanism, deciphering how tyrosine phosphorylation modulates 7 dual ionotropic/metabotropic molecular function is required for understanding its integral role in physiological and pathological processes. 7 single-channel activity elicited by ACh appears as brief isolated openings and less often as episodes of few openings in quick succession. The reduction of phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase inhibition increases the duration and frequency of activation episodes, whereas the inhibition of phosphatases has the opposite effect. Removal of two tyrosine residues at the 7 intracellular domain recapitulates the effects mediated by tyrosine kinase inhibition. The tyrosine-free mutant receptor shows longer duration-activation episodes, reduced desensitization rate and significantly faster recovery from desensitization, indicating that phosphorylation decreases 7 channel activity by favoring the desensitized state. However, the mutant receptor is incapable of triggering ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to the 7-agonist. Thus, while tyrosine phosphorylation is absolutely required for 7-triggered ERK pathway, it negatively modulates 7 ionotropic activity. Overall, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events fine-tune the integrated cell response mediated by 7 activation, thus having a broad impact on 7 cholinergic signaling.","output":"Tyrosine phosphorylation differentially fine-tunes ionotropic and metabotropic responses of human 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, is characterized by a delay in type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated antiviral defenses alongside robust cytokine production. Here, we investigate the underlying molecular basis for this imbalance and implicate virus-mediated activation of NF-B in the absence of other canonical IFN-I-related transcription factors. Epigenetic and single-cell transcriptomic analyses show a selective NF-B signature that was most prominent in infected cells. Disruption of NF-B signaling through the silencing of the NF-B transcription factor p65 or p50 resulted in loss of virus replication that was rescued upon reconstitution. These findings could be further corroborated with the use of NF-B inhibitors, which reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. These data suggest that the robust cytokine production in response to SARS-CoV-2, despite a diminished IFN-I response, is the product of a dependency on NF-B for viral replication.

Biopsies were harvested at the injection site, which were then cultured for 72 h. Subsequently, the crawled-out cells were collected from the medium and analyzed with flow cytometry. Intradermal administration of ovalbumin (OVA, model antigen) solution at various depths in the skin did not affect the migration and maturation of DCs.

Subsequently, both OVA and Bet v 1 were formulated in cationic and anionic liposomes, which altered antigen uptake drastically following intradermal microinjection. While OVA uptake was reduced by formulation in liposomes, Bet v 1 uptake in dDCs was increased by encapsulation in both cationic and anionic liposomes.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used RNA-seq to assess whether Theileria infected cell lines from Sahiwal cattle display a different transcriptome profile compared to Holstein and screened for altered expression of parasite factors that could generate differences in host cell gene expression. Significant differences (<0.1 FDR) in the expression level of a large number (2211) of bovine genes were identified, with enrichment of genes associated with Type I IFN, cholesterol biosynthesis, oncogenesis and parasite infection.

Recently, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) were recognized to drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a common principle for organizing cellular membraneless organelles (MLOs). ATP, the universal energy currency for all living cells, mysteriously has concentrations of 2-12 mM, much higher than required for its previously-known functions. Only recently, ATP was decoded to behave as a biological hydrotrope to inhibit protein LLPS and aggregation at mM. We further revealed that ATP also acts as a bivalent binder, which not only biphasically modulates LLPS driven by IDRs of human and viral proteins, but also bind to the conserved nucleic-acid-binding surfaces of the folded proteins. Most unexpectedly, ATP appears to act as a hydration mediator to antagonize the crowding-induced destabilization as well as to enhance folding of proteins without significant binding. Here, this review focuses on summarizing the results of these biophysical studies and discussing their implications in an evolutionary context. By linking triphosphate with unique hydration property to adenosine, ATP appears to couple the ability for establishing hydrophobic, &#960;-&#960;, &#960;-cation and electrostatic interactions to the capacity in mediating hydration of proteins, which is at the heart of folding, dynamics, stability, phase separation and aggregation. Consequently, ATP acquired a category of functions at ~mM to energy-independently control protein homeostasis with diverse mechanisms, thus implying a link between cellular ATP concentrations and protein-aggregation diseases.","output":"Adenosine triphosphate energy-independently controls protein homeostasis with unique structure and diverse mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionWith the emergence of the first COVID-19 case in Saudi Arabia, Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare has immediately executed the appropriate protocols in response to this severe global crisis.

DESIGN Retrospective case review and learning curve evaluation with a skill acquisition model. Animals-27 client-owned dogs. Procedures-Between April 2011 and December 2012, 27 dogs underwent elective LESS ovariectomy performed by a single experienced board-certified laparoscopic surgeon by means of the same technique. Medical records for these patients were reviewed to determine whether a learning curve could be detected. A commercially available multitrocar port was inserted through a 15- to 20-mm incision at the umbilicus, and LESS ovariectomy was performed with articulating graspers, a bipolar vessel-sealing device, and a 30 telescope. Surgical performance of the surgeon was quantified with an exponential skill acquisition model, and how skill was gained with repetition of the same novel surgical procedure was examined. RESULTS Median patient body weight was 20 kg (44 lb; range, 3.5 to 41 kg [7.7 to 90.2 lb]). Median surgical time was 35 minutes (range, 20 to 80 minutes). Median patient age was 314 days (range, 176 to 2,913 days). The skill acquisition model revealed that a comparable surgeon could reach 90% of optimal surgery performance after approximately 8 procedures (8.6, 95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 16.6 procedures). According to the model, with each surgery, surgical time would be expected to decrease by 27% (95% confidence interval, 2% to 52%). Complications were limited to minor hemorrhage due to a splenic laceration and a postoperative incisional infection. Follow-up information was available for all 27 cases. All owners were satisfied and indicated that they would pursue LESS ovariectomy again. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The learning curve for LESS ovariectomy was short and definable. Short-term outcome was excellent. Results of this study suggested that an experienced laparoscopic surgeon may anticipate achieving proficiency with this technique after performing approximately 8 procedures.","output":"Evaluation of the learning curve for a board-certified veterinary surgeon performing laparoendoscopic single-site ovariectomy in dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes to develop a parallel reading of the banking supervision system and the framework for the enforcement of competition law, with the purpose of setting out points of convergence and divergence between the two, analyzing their institutional architecture and various issues pertaining to the relevant, applicable law.

Sensitive and specific immunoassays provide the ability to identify exposure to SARS-CoV-2, to determine seroconversion, to confirm eligibility for donation of convalescent plasma as well as play an essential part in epidemiological studies. We report on the validation of the Ansh Laboratories SARS-CoV-2 IgG and SARS-CoV-2 IgM ELISA immunoassays. These assays were evaluated for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies for clinical use in our hospital as part of an orthogonal testing algorithm recommended by the CDC. Methods Diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the IgG and IgM ELISA assays were tested using samples confirmed to be negative or positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. We also evaluated precision, analytical interference, and cross-reactivity with known cases of infection with other viruses. Additionally, we validated concordance with molecular and other serological testing and evaluated seroconversion in our patient population. Results The IgG and IgM ELISA assays showed acceptable precision, were robust to analytical interference and did not exhibit cross reactivity with specimens positive for common respiratory viruses. Both assays exhibited 95% agreement with a primary screening serological assay utilized at our institution as well as with a reference laboratory semi-quantitative method. Concordance with RT-PCR was excellent >6 days after symptom onset (100%).

This study aimed to provide evidence on the costs and budgetary impact of the potential replacement of the tetanus-toxoid (TT) vaccine with the Td vaccine, considering different possible delivery strategies. METHOD: We used an activity-based ingredients costing approach to estimate the 2017 program costs of providing TT vaccination to girls aged 15C16 years and conducting Td campaigns in outbreak areas. We performed a budget impact analysis for 2018C2025 using the cost per dose estimates based on the current delivery of these vaccines. We assumed complete cessation of TT vaccination of girls aged 15C16 years and a transition period where Td outbreak control campaigns would still occur. Td vaccine was assumed to be provided to children aged 7 years using either facility- or school-based delivery or combined facility- and school-based delivery. RESULTS: The delivery cost per dose for current TT vaccination for girls aged 15C16 years was US$1.49 for school-based delivery, US$1.76 for facility-based delivery, and US$3.86 for delivery via outreach. Td vaccination through campaigns was estimated to cost US$3.56/dose. During 2018C2025, replacing the TT vaccine for girls aged 15C16 years with the Td vaccine for children aged 7 years is estimated to save US$4.61 million in immunization delivery costs if a school-based delivery strategy is used or US$1.04 million if facility-based delivery is used. CONCLUSION: Compared to the current plan, delivery of Td routine vaccination via a school-based strategy was the most cost saving. These results were used in late 2019 to support the delivery of Td vaccination using a school-based delivery strategy for children aged 7 years in 30 Northern provinces in Vietnam.","output":"Cost of Delivering Tetanus Toxoid and Tetanus-Diphtheria Vaccination in Vietnam and the Budget Impact of Proposed Changes to the Schedule"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to investigate individuals' perceptions of travel fear and anxiety of COVID-19, the protection procedures taken by both UAE and Egypt to maintain tourists' safety and how these perceptions affect travel intentions.

Considering the changing landscape of HCV treatment, prevention, and care, and in light of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, this analysis seeks to evaluate Swedens progress toward the WHO elimination targets and identify remaining barriers. METHODS: The data used for modeling HCV transmission and disease burden in Sweden were obtained through literature review, unpublished sources, and expert input. A dynamic Markov model was employed to forecast population sizes and incidence of HCV through 2030. Two scenarios (2019 Base and WHO Targets) were developed to evaluate Swedens progress toward HCV elimination. RESULTS: At the beginning of 2019, there were 29,700 (95% UI: 19,300 C 33,700) viremic infections in Sweden. Under the base scenario, Sweden would achieve and exceed the WHO targets for diagnosis, treatment, and liver\\\\related death. However, new infections would decrease by less than 10%, relative to 2015. Achieving all WHO targets by 2030 would require 1) expanding harm reduction programs to reach more than 90% of PWID and 2) treating 90% of HCV+ PWID engaged in harm reduction programs and 7% of PWID not involved in harm reduction programs, annually by 2025.

Plaque assays remain the gold standard, but are impractical for high-throughput screening. In this study, we show that expression of viral proteases may be used to quantitate infected cells. Our assays exploit the cleavage of specific oligopeptide linkers, leading to the activation of cell-based optical biosensors. First, we characterise these biosensors using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteases. Next, we confirm their ability to detect viral protease expression during replication of authentic virus. Finally, we generate reporter cells stably expressing an optimised luciferase-based biosensor, enabling viral infection to be measured within 24 h in a 96- or 384-well plate format, including variants of concern. We have therefore developed a luminescent SARS-CoV-2 reporter cell line, and demonstrated its utility for the relative quantitation of infectious virus and titration of neutralising antibodies. Author summary Techniques for measuring infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory are laborious and time-consuming, and different laboratories use different approaches. There is therefore no generally agreed way to quantitate neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which block infection with the virus and protect people from COVID-19. In this study, we describe a new way to measure SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is much simpler and faster than existing methods. It relies on the production of a specific protease enzyme by the virus, which is able to cleave and activate an engineered protein biosensor in infected cells. This biosensor emits light in the presence of viral infection, and the amount of light released is used as a readout for the amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 present. The signal is very sensitive, so the number of infected cells required is very small, and the method can be scaled-up to test many samples at once. In particular, we demonstrate how it can be used to detect different variants of SARS-CoV-2, and quantitate neutralising antibodies against these viruses.","output":"A protease-activatable luminescent biosensor and reporter cell line for authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages have emerged continuously, mostly through the genomic accumulation of substitutions.

Overall, while controlling the spread of COVID-19 must be a major concern for all people, society needs to consider various options, including those of alternative reopening strategies to reflect both the impact on children when reopening of daycares/day camps but also the potential impact on viral growth transmittance. Infectivity modeling scenarios are described for the province of Ontario, indicating how the caseloads may reverberate through the population in response to the opening of daycare and summer day camps. An SEIR model, stratified by age, is used to model the primary compartments of the virus. The results show that the spread of COVID-19 reached a peak in April 2020 and steadily declined for Toronto and Peel Public Health Units (PHUs). Furthermore, the model indicates that reducing daycare and day camp capacities by 50&#x0025;results in more than a 75&#x0025;reduction in impacts on caseload and deaths, relative to not undertaking due care and diligence to control the virus growth.

Findings from an online survey with 623 owners and managers show that ex-ante business problems, and financing by loans or credit, reduce the likelihood of owners perceiving their business as resilient;while, delivery and takeaway service, ownership of property and higher age of owners, increase the likelihood of enterprise resilience. The paper contributes to understanding how restaurants and bars absorb and cope with the COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, we make recommendation for future research on the recovery and adaptability of the business sector.","output":"Rapid responding to the COVID-19 crisis: assessing the resilience in the German restaurant and bar industry.

Morbidity and mortality can be considerable on a farm with huge economic consequences for the farmer as well as compromised welfare for the mink kits. Although efforts have been taken to identify etiologic agents involved in outbreaks, the syndrome is still regarded as multifactorial and recurring problems on the same farms draw attention to management and environmental risk factors. In the pre-weaning period from May to June 2015, a case control study was carried out on 30 Danish mink farms. Data concerning management, biosecurity, hygiene, feed consumption, antibacterial prescription and production efficiency were analyzed. RESULTS: The proportion of 1-year old females, farm size (total number of females), energy supply per female in the late gestation period, and dogs accessing the farm area were significantly associated with being a case farm. Case farms were prescribed almost twice the amount of antibacterials per gestational unit (female and litter) as in control farms. Farmers on case farms spent significantly more time nursing and treating the animals and experienced more females with mastitis compared to farmers on control farms. No significant differences in cleaning practices or hygienic measures between case and control farms were found and there were no differences in drinking water quality, bedding material, composition neither of color types nor in management regarding litter equalization. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study showed an association between the occurrence of pre-weaning diarrhea on mink farms and parity profile, farm size and feeding intensity in the gestational period. The access of dogs to the farm area was a significant risk factor, but needs further clarification.

The PD patient presents motor dysfunction such as resting tremor, bradykinesia, and muscular rigidity. To investigate the mechanism of aerobic exercise to improve PD-related motor dysfunction, in the current study, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was used to induce the PD mice model, and the motor function of PD mice was comprehensively evaluated by open-field test, rotarod test, and gait test. The co-expression of prodynorphin (PDYN) and proenkephalin (PENK) with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) and phosphorylation Erk1/2 (p-Erk1/2) were detected by double-labeling immunofluorescence. The results showed that a 4-week aerobic exercise intervention could effectively improve the motor dysfunction of PD mice. Moreover, it was found that the expressions of Erk1/2 and p-Erk1/2 in the dorsal striatum (Str) of PD mice were significantly increased, and the number of positive cells co-expressed by Erk1/2, p-Erk1/2, and PENK was significantly higher than PDYN. The above phenomenon was reversed by a 4-week aerobic exercise intervention. Therefore, this study suggests that the mechanism by which aerobic exercise improves PD-related motor dysfunction may be related to that the aerobic exercise intervention alleviates the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinases (Erk/MAPK) signaling pathway in striatal medium spiny neurons expressing D2-like receptors (D2-MSNs) of PD mice by regulating the striatal DA and Glu signaling.

The polymerization is initiated by primary amine initiators using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent. Carrying out the reaction in a silicon microflow reactor speeds up the rate of ROP (92% conversion in 40 min in flow as opposed to 6 h in batch) due to highly efficient permeation of CO2 through the reactor tubing.

There are a wide variety of opinions regarding both safe use of the device and patient care following aerodigestive tract injury. We have seen an increase in videolaryngoscopy-associated injuries in recent years at our institution. Because of this, we wanted to determine if video-assisted laryngoscopy presents a greater risk of injury compared with direct laryngoscopy. Furthermore, we wanted to determine if there were patient and/or surgical factors that could contribute to patient injuries following videolaryngoscopy. DATA SOURCES MAMC anesthesia records, PubMed, Ovid. REVIEW METHODS We compared rates of injury between videolaryngoscopy to direct laryngoscopy at our institution by searching anesthesia records to identify laryngoscopy procedures that resulted in injury to the soft palate or oropharynx. We also identified 19 published cases in the literature, in addition to our cases, that we reviewed for patient characteristics (e.g., body mass index, age and sex, Mallampati grade), type of videolaryngoscope, location of injury, and type of repair (if any) required. RESULTS At our institution, we have a statistically higher rate of injury using videolaryngoscopy compared to direct laryngoscopy. Our data also indicate that women are more commonly injured during videolaryngoscope intubation than men. The right tonsillar pillars and soft palate are the most frequently injured, with through-and-through perforation of the soft tissues being the most common type of injury. The most common repair of injuries required simple closures, and long-term harm was very rare.

Data was obtained from a bespoke epilepsy electronic patient record (EPR). METHODS: Predetermined search parameters of well-established broad categories of epilepsy aetiology were used to identify patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy attending Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. There were 3216 patients that met the inclusion criteria for this study. We included living patients with epilepsy attending our institution. We then excluded patients with a diagnosis of pure non-epileptic attack disorder and patients found to have idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) (n = 382) from our final cohort. We excluded IGE due to the complex polygenic basis underlying this patient group. RESULTS: An aetiology was identified in 54.3 % (n = 1747) of the total number of patients studied. Of the symptomatic epilepsies, 41.08 % (n = 1321) were acquired and 13.3 % (n = 426) were predominantly of genetic or developmental aetiology. The most common causes of the acquired epilepsies were hippocampal sclerosis (n = 380; 28.75 %), cerebral tumor (n = 279; 21.06 %), traumatic brain injury (n = 248; 18.77 %), stroke and cerebrovascular disease (n = 151; 11.43 %) and perinatal causes (n = 138; 10.45 %). The leading causes in the genetic / developmental category included cavernous haemangiomas (n = 62, 22.22 %), arteriovenous malformations (n = 59; 21.15 %) and cortical dysplasia (n = 55; 19.71 %). The aetiology of a patient's epilepsy was undetermined in 45.68 % (n = 1469) of individuals. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the clinical utility of the ILAE's 2017 revised classification of the epilepsies and highlights the evolving dynamic nature of attributing causality in epilepsy.

The diaphragm function was evaluated by measuring the tracheal pressure generated in response to a bilateral magnetic phrenic nerves stimulations. Weaning-induced pulmonary oedema was diagnosed in case of failure of the spontaneous breathing trial if patients exhibited signs of plasma concentration or echocardiographic diagnosis of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure elevation.

The aim of this study was to assess whether surgical method is a factor in predicting subsequent pregnancy in women with interstitial pregnancy who underwent laparoscopic cornuostomy or laparoscopic wedge resection. METHODS Medical records of all women with interstitial pregnancy who underwent laparoscopic cornuostomy or laparoscopic wedge resection between March 2008 and October 2017 in a medical center were reviewed. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors predicting subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS Forty patients underwent laparoscopic cornuostomy (n = 14) or laparoscopic wedge resection (n = 26) for the treatment of interstitial pregnancy. Twelve women become pregnant during follow-up. Laparoscopic cornuostomy was associated with shorter operation time (coefficient = -19.1 minutes, 95% CI = -36.9 to -1.3 minutes, p = 0.04, multivariable analysis) than that of laparoscopic wedge resection. Furthermore, laparoscopic cornuostomy (hazard ratio = 6.3, p = 0.03), parity (hazard ratio = 0.18, p = 0.008), and preoperative rupture of the cornus (hazard ratio = 13.3, p = 0.005) were independent predictors of subsequent pregnancy. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic cornuostomy was associated with a higher probability of subsequent pregnancy and a shorter operation time. Thus, compared with laparoscopic wedge resection, laparoscopic cornuostomy might be a better surgical procedure for women with interstitial pregnancy, particularly for women who wish to become pregnant later.

On that date, there were 134,576 reported cases and 4981 deaths worldwide. By March 26, 2020, just 2 weeks later, reported cases had increased four-fold to 531,865, and deaths increased five-fold to 24,073. Older people are both major users of telehealth services and are more likely to die as a result of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the extent that Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, during the 2 weeks following the pandemic announcement, sought to promote telehealth as a tool that could help identify COVID-19 among older people who may live alone, be frail, or be self-isolating, and give support to or facilitate the treatment of people who are or may be infected. METHODS: This paper reports, for the 2-week period previously mentioned and immediately prior, on activities and initiatives in the three countries taken by governments or their agencies (at national or state levels) together with publications or guidance issued by professional, trade, and charitable bodies. Different sources of information are drawn upon that point to the perceived likely benefits of telehealth in fighting the pandemic. It is not the purpose of this paper to draw together or analyze information that reflects growing knowledge about COVID-19, except where telehealth is seen as a component. RESULTS: The picture that emerges for the three countries, based on the sources identified, shows a number of differences. These differences center on the nature of their health services, the extent of attention given to older people (and the circumstances that can relate to them), the different geographies (notably concerned with rurality), and the changes to funding frameworks that could impact these. Common to all three countries is the value attributed to maintaining quality safeguards in the wider context of their health services but where such services are noted as sometimes having precluded significant telehealth use. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing changes and may help to establish telehealth more firmly in its aftermath. Some of the changes may not be long-lasting. However, the momentum is such that telehealth will almost certainly find a stronger place within health service frameworks for each of the three countries and is likely to have increased acceptance among both patients and health care providers.","output":"Telehealth in the Context of COVID-19: Changing Perspectives in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has shown a relatively low mortality rate in young healthy individuals, with the majority of this group being asymptomatic or having mild symptoms, while the severity of the disease among individuals with underlying health conditions has caused signiffcant mortality rates worldwide. Understanding these differences in mortality amongst different sectors of society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk and vulnerabilities to be determined to enable strategies exit the lockdown. However, epidemiological models do not account for the variability encountered in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease across different population groups. To overcome this limitation, it is proposed that a modiffed SEIR model, namely SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. This enables the analysis of the spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. A Monte Carlo simulation indicates a large number of deaths could be avoided by slightly decreasing the exposure of vulnerable groups to the disease. From this modelling a number of mechanisms can be proposed to limit the exposure of vulnerable individuals to the disease in order to reduce the mortality rate among this group. One option could be the provision of a wristband to vulnerable people and those without a contact-tracing app. By combining very dense contact tracing data from smartphone apps and wristband signals with information about infection status and symptoms, vulnerable people can be protected and kept safer. Widespread utilisation would extend the protection further beyond these high risk groups.","output":"A Modified Epidemiological Model to Understand the Uneven Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Individuals and the Approaches Required to Help them Emerge from Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics are affecting tourism in many ways Being a niche research field before, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic created a strong urgency to develop this topic For researching pandemic-induced changes in tourist beliefs and travel behaviour, we developed a construct that measures the intra-personal anxiety of travellers (and non-travellers): the Pandemic (COVID-19) Anxiety Travel Scale (PATS), using two large online studies (N=2,180;N=2,062) and including two different cultural contexts (US;Denmark) In Study 1, explorative and confirmative factors analysis confirms a short and easy-to-use 5-item solution, while the presented model adds face validity In Study 2, we confirmed the structure (reliability) and tested nomological validity, by putting PATS into the context of different constructs (xenophobia and prevention focus) Although the proposed scale arose from the coronavirus (COVID-19), it is not limited to this specific pandemic and will hopefully prove to be a valuable measurement tool for future pandemics as well","output":"Too Afraid to Travel?Development of a Pandemic (COVID-19) Anxiety Travel Scale (PATS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objectives: The impacts of COVID-19 are like two sides of one coin During 2020, there were many research papers that proved our environmental and climate conditions were improving due to lockdown or large-scale restriction regulations In contrast, the economic conditions deteriorated due to disruption in industry business activities and most people stayed at home and worked from home, which probably reduced the noise pollution Methods: To assess whether there were differences in noise pollution before and during COVID-19 In this paper, we use various statistical methods following odds ratios, Wilcoxon and Fishers tests and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with various comparisons of prior selection The outcome of interest for a parameter in Bayesian inference is complete posterior distribution Roughly, the mean of the posterior will be clear with point approximation That being said, the median is an available choice Findings: To make the Bayesian MCMC work, we ran the sampling from the conditional posterior distributions It is straightforward to draw random samples from these distributions if they have regular shapes using MCMC The case of over-standard noise per time frame, number of noise petition cases, number of industry petition cases, number of motorcycles, number of cars and density of vehicles are significant at =5% In line with this, we prove that there were differences of noise pollution before and during COVID-19 in Taiwan Meanwhile, the decreased noise pollution in Taiwan can improve quality of life","output":"Did Noise Pollution Really Improve during COVID-19?

If recent events are of any indicators of the epidemics of past, it is undeniable to state a fact that the SARS-CoV2 viral infection is highly transmissible with respect to its previously related SARS-CoVs. Papain-like protease (PLpro) is an enzyme that is required by the virus itself for replicating into the host system; and it does so by processing its polyproteins into a functional replicase complex. PLpro is also known for downregulating the genes responsible for producing interferons, an essential family of molecules produced in response to viral infection, thus making this protein an indispensable drug target. In this study, PLpro inhibitors were identified through high throughput structure-based virtual screening approach from NPASS natural product library possessing ~ 35,000 compounds. Top five hits were scrutinised based on structural aromaticity and ability to interact with a key active site residue of PLpro, Tyr268. For second level of screening, the MM-GBSA End-Point Binding Free Energy Calculation of the docked complexes was performed, which identified Caesalpiniaphenol A as the best hit. Caesalpiniaphenol A not only possess a double ring aromatic moiety but also has lowest minimum binding energy, which is at par with the control GRL0617, the only known inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 PLpro. Details of the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and ADMET analysis helped to conclusively determine Caesalpiniaphenol A as potentially an inhibitor of SARS-CoV2 PLpro.

Three cases presented in this article show several different perspectives where telehealth was utilized. For the first patient, appointments were successfully completed via telehealth;however, the patient's family opted to continue with an unsecure internet connection at a local laundromat. For the second patient, a stable internet connection could not be obtained in his home, thus making telehealth appointments unavailable. The caregiver of this patient ended up driving to the clinic to have adjustments made in person. For the third patient, telehealth appointments were unavailable due to unstable internet connections as well as difficulty setting up video interpreting services. These cases highlight the idea that telehealth can be incredibly beneficial, when used correctly. For some, the option to attend appointments virtually gives them access to specialists that otherwise may not be available. For other patients, aspects such as access to smart devices and steady internet access must be considered to ensure a successful connection. The hope is that this article sheds light on some of the potential setbacks that can come from the use of telehealth appointments in a practice and provides discussion regarding for whom telehealth may be appropriate, even in pediatric patients.

Individuals with HED often have disrupted epithelial barriers and, therefore, were suspected to be more susceptible to coronavirus infection. METHODS: 56 households with at least one member who had coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) were enrolled in a longitudinal study to compare the course of illness, immune responses, and long-term consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in HED patients (n = 15, age 9C52 years) and control subjects of the same age group (n = 149). RESULTS: In 14 HED patients, mild or moderate typical COVID-19 symptoms were observed that lasted for 4C45 days. Fever during the first days sometimes required external cooling measures. The course of COVID-19 was similar to that in control subjects if patients developed antibodies blocking the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Five out of six HED patients with completely abrogated ectodysplasin A signalling (83%) suffered from chronic, in two cases very severe fatigue following COVID-19, while only 25% of HED patients with residual activity of this pathway and 21% of control subjects recovering from COVID-19 experienced postinfectious fatigue. Hair loss after COVID-19 was also more frequent among HED patients (64%) than in the control group (13%). CONCLUSIONS: HED appears to be associated with an increased risk of long-term consequences of a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Prison governance and management under such circumstances have facilitated the revelation of existing mechanisms of control. Focusing on the experience of frontline officers, this paper explores how the Chinese prison system contained the spread of COVID-19 inside its walls by demanding officers work on lockdown shifts, and what we can learn about its governing logic. Multi-sourced data is utilized, including government-issued policies and reports, media reports, blog posts written by prison officers and participant observation as well as semi-structured interviews with frontline prison officers. This study offers a diachronic analysis of pandemic control within the prison system, focusing on key turning points. By examining frontline prison officers accounts through first- and second-hand data, the study explores the execution of control policies and how they affect individual lives. The study found that prison officers were ordered to fight at the forefront of pandemic control in prisons by working on shifts inside for an extended and indefinite period of time, which proved effective in terminating the spread of the virus, but placed a heavy burden on the personal lives of the officers. The findings also reveal new facets in the mobility and experience of frontline officers.

The emergence of Delta in the UK occurred on the background of a heterogeneous landscape of immunity and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions(4,5). Here we analyse 52,992 Delta genomes from England in combination with 93,649 global genomes to reconstruct the emergence of Delta, and quantify its introduction to and regional dissemination across England, in the context of changing travel and social restrictions. Through analysis of human movement, contact tracing, and virus genomic data, we find that the focus of geographic expansion of Delta shifted from India to a more global pattern in early May 2021. In England, Delta lineages were introduced >1,000 times and spread nationally as non-pharmaceutical interventions were relaxed. We find that hotel quarantine for travellers from India reduced onward transmission from importations; however the transmission chains that later dominated the Delta wave in England had been already seeded before restrictions were introduced. In England, increasing inter-regional travel drove Deltas nationwide dissemination, with some cities receiving >2,000 observable lineage introductions from other regions. Subsequently, increased levels of local population mixing, not the number of importations, was associated with faster relative growth of Delta. Among US states, we find that regions that previously experienced large waves also had faster Delta growth rates, and a model including interactions between immunity and human behaviour could accurately predict the rise of Delta there. Deltas invasion dynamics depended on fine scale spatial heterogeneity in immunity and contact patterns and our findings will inform optimal spatial interventions to reduce transmission of current and future VOCs such as Omicron.","output":"Context-specific emergence and growth of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Large number of passengers, limited space and shared surfaces can transform public transportation into a hub of epidemic spread. This study was conducted to investigate whether proximity to railway stations, a proxy for utilization, was associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection across small-areas of Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Portugal). Methods: The number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections from March 2 until July 5, 2020 at parish-level was obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. We used a Geographic Information System to estimate proximity to railway stations from the six railway lines operating in the area. Then, we fitted a quasi-Poisson generalized linear regression model to estimate the relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI). Results: Between May 2 and July 5, 2020, there were a total of 17,168 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, with wide disparities between parishes. Globally, parishes near one of the railway lines (Sintra) presented significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rates (RR=1.42, 95%CI 1.16, 1.75) compared to those parishes located far away from railway stations, while the opposite happened for parishes near other railway lines (Sado/Fertagus), whose infection rates were significantly lower than those observed in parishes located far away from railway stations (RR=0.66, 95%CI 0.50, 0.87). However, the associations varied according to the stage of the epidemic and according to mitigation measures in place. Regression results also revealed an increasing influence of socioeconomic deprivation on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Conclusions: We found no consistent association between proximity to railway stations and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the most affected metropolitan area of the country, suggesting that other factors (e.g. socioeconomic deprivation) might play a more prominent role in the epidemic dynamics.","output":"Urban rail transport and SARS-CoV-2 infections: an ecological study in Lisbon Metropolitan Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific evidence suggests that Saharan dust intrusions in Southern Europe contribute to the worsening of multiple pathologies and increase the concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and other pollutants. However, few studies have examined whether Saharan dust intrusions influence the incidence and severity of COVID-19 cases.

The results obtained in this study suggest that chemical air pollutants, and especially NO2, are related to the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in Spain. Furthermore, Saharan dust intrusions have an additional effect beyond what is attributable to the variation in air pollution; they are related, in different lags, to both the incidence and hospital admissions rates for COVID-19.

Commercially available digital health technologies (DHTs C e.g. smartphones, smartwatches and apps) may hold significant potential in healthcare upon successful and constructive implementation. Literature on the topic is split between enthusiasm associated with potential benefits and concerns around privacy, reliability and overall effectiveness. However, little is known about what healthcare professionals (HCPs) have experienced so far with patients and what they perceive as the main advantages and disadvantages of adoption. This study therefore aims to investigate current perceptions of HCPs towards self-tracked health-related outputs from devices and apps available to the public. METHODS: Nine HCPs volunteered to take part in semi-structured interviews. Related data were thematically analysed, following a deductive approach with the construction of a framework based on expected themes from the relevant literature, and themes identified from the first two interviews. FINDINGS: The following main themes in relation to DHTs were identified and explored in detail: HCPs experience, knowledge and views; advantages and disadvantages; barriers towards healthcare implementation and potential solutions; future directions. While most participants were adopters of DHTs and held positive views about them, their overall experience with patients and the technology was limited. Potential reasons for this were explored, including factors such as time/resources; colleagues mindset; lack of evidence of effectiveness for practice; data security concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The potential advantages of DHTs adoption in healthcare are substantial, e.g. patient autonomy, time/resources saving, health and behaviour change promotion, but are presently premature. Therefore, future research is warranted, focussing on addressing barriers, minimising disadvantages, and assessing the clinical value of commercially available DHTs.","output":"Sometimes I dont have a pulse  and Im still alive!

However, most of the health information delivered through the national dashboard and the COVID-19 awareness campaigns are generic and do not necessarily make the impact needed to be seen on individuals behavior. Health messages need to be applicable and reverent to the individual in the audience. OBJECTIVE: In light of Fogg-Behavior model, this research aims to build and validate a behavior-change-based messaging campaign to promote precautionary health behavior in individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention messages can then be targeted appropriately during the pandemic. METHODS: An initial library of 32 text-based and video-based messages were developed and validated based on Fogg behavior model for behavior change. Based on this model, three groups of messages were created to reflect the models three theoretical concepts of motivation, ability and triggers. Each group of messages is designed to target different segment of the audience. The content of the messages was developed based on resources from the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia. The validity of this content was evaluated by domain experts through the content validity index. RESULTS: Fogg-behavior model was used to segment the audience into three different groups based on their perceived ability and motivation. The three groups of messages designed for those groups were found relevant to Fogg theoretical concepts. Thirteen professional health care workers (n = 13) evaluated the content of the message libraries in Arabic and English. Thirty-two messages were found to have acceptable content validity (I-CVI = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: This research introduced Fogg Behavior Model as a behavior change model to develop targeted messages for three groups of the audience based on their motivation and ability level toward maintaining precautionary behavior during the pandemic. This targeted awareness messaging campaign can be utilized by health authorities to raise individuals' awareness about the precautionary measures that should be taken, maintain these measures and hence help in reducing the number of positive cases in the city of Jeddah.","output":"Promoting Precautionary Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development and Validation of a Behavior-Change Messaging Campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mougeotia spp. collected from field samples were investigated for their conjugation morphology by light-, fluorescence-, scanning- and transmission electron microscopy. During a scalarifom conjugation, the extragametangial zygospores were initially surrounded by a thin cell wall that developed into a multi-layered zygospore wall. Maturing zygospores turned dark brown and were filled with storage compounds such as lipids and starch. While M. parvula had a smooth surface, M. disjuncta had a punctated surface structure and a prominent suture. The zygospore wall consisted of a polysaccharide rich endospore, followed by a thin layer with a lipid-like appaerance, a massive electron dense mesospore and a very thin exospore composed of polysaccharides. Glycan microarray analysis of zygospores of different developmental stages revealed the occurrence of pectins and hemicelluloses, mostly composed of homogalacturonan (HG), xyloglucans, xylans, arabino-galactan proteins and extensins. In situ localization by the probe OG7-13AF 488 labelled HG in young zygospore walls, vegetative filaments and most prominently in conjugation tubes and cross walls. Raman imaging showed the distribution of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and aromatic components of the mature zygospore with a spatial resolution of ~ 250 nm. The carbohydrate nature of the endo- and exospore was confirmed and in-between an enrichment of lipids and aromatic components, probably algaenan or a sporopollenin-like material. Taken together, these results indicate that during zygospore formation, reorganizations of the cell walls occured, leading to a resistant and protective structure.","output":"Cell wall characteristics during sexual reproduction of Mougeotia sp.

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and content of nightmares during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, evaluating its associations with sociodemographic, occupational, and clinical factors. Cross-sectional exploratory study, including 1,057 participants who responded to an online survey about mental violence and nightmares during the pandemic, between May 25 and June 1, 2020. A descriptive analysis of the results was done to obtain frequency tables. McNemar's non-parametric test was used to compare the frequency of nightmares before and after the pandemic, and logistic regression models, to identify factors most strongly associated with the pandemic nightmares. Participants were from 21 Brazilian states, with a mean age of 38  14 years, and 78% women. Half of them (n = 529) reported at least one nightmare episode during the pandemic, and 32.9% (n = 348) described a pandemic content. There was nearly a 3-fold increase in the occurrence of nightmares once a week or more during the pandemic, 9% before vs. 25% after. Prior psychiatric care, suicidal ideation, sleep medication, increased pandemic alcohol consumption, perceiving high risk of contamination, being woman, and of younger age were factors associated with having nightmares during the pandemic. Prior psychiatric care, sleep medication, and age remained significant after excluding participants without nightmares and comparing between individuals with and without a pandemic content. We conclude the COVID-19 pandemic has affected people's dreams. The increase in the frequency of nightmares, their pandemic content, and association with previous conditions are a concerning public mental health issue and should be taken into consideration by authorities and policy makers.","output":"Mental Violence: The COVID-19 Nightmare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation opacity (CLO) are the common CT lung opacities, and their heterogeneity may have potential for prognosis ofcoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate clinical outcomes in individual COVID-19 patients using histogram heterogeneity analysis based on CT opacities. METHODS: 71 COVID-19 cases' medical records were retrospectively reviewed from a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 24th to February 28th at the early stage of the pandemic. Two characteristic lung abnormity opacities, GGO and CLO, were drawn on CT images to identify the heterogeneity using quantitative histogram analysis. The parameters (mean, mode, kurtosis, and skewness) were derived from histograms to evaluate the accuracy of clinical classification and outcome prediction. Nomograms were built to predict the risk of death and median length of hospital stays (LOS), respectively. RESULTS: A total of 57 COVID-19 cases were eligible for the study cohort after excluding 14 cases. The highest lung abnormalities were GGO mixed with CLO in both the survival populations (26 in 42, 61.9%) and died population (10 in 15, 66.7%). The best performance heterogeneity parameters to discriminate severe type from mild/moderate counterparts were as follows: GGO_skewness: specificity=66.67%, sensitivity=78.12%, AUC=0.706; CLO_mean: specificity=70.00%, sensitivity=76.92%, and AUC=0.746. Nomogram based on histogram parameters can predict the individual risk of death and the prolonged median LOS of COVID-19 patients.

However, as the type of code needed for the development of sophisticated interactive web services and online applications becomes more complex, so the guidelines have had to be updated with the adoption of new success criteria or additional revisions to older criteria. In some instances, this has led to questions being raised about the reliability of the automatic accessibility checks and whether the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be helpful.

Most bacterial detection methods are time-consuming and take days to give the result. Aptamers are a promising alternative for a quick and reliable measurement technique to detect bacteria present in food products. Selected aptamers are DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that can bind with bacteria or other molecules with affinity and specificity for the target cells by the SELEX or cell-SELEX technique. This method is based on some rounds to remove the non-ligand oligonucleotides, leaving the aptamers specific to bind to the selected bacteria. Compared with conventional methodologies, the detection approach using aptamers is a rapid, low-cost form of analysis. OBJECTIVE: This review summarizes obtention methods and applications of aptamers in the food industry and biotechnology. Besides, different techniques with aptamers are presented, which enable more effective target detection. CONCLUSION: Applications of aptamers as biosensors, or the association of aptamers with nanomaterials, may be employed in analyses by colorimetric, fluorescence, or electrical devices.

The RF signal radiated from IoT devices as well as other wireless technologies create an RF cloud causing co- and cross-interference to each other. Lack of a science and technology for understanding, measurement, and modeling of the RF cloud interference in near real-time results in inefficient utilization of the precious spectrum, a unique natural resource shared among all wireless devices of the universe in frequency, time, and space. Near real time forecasting of the RF cloud interference is essential to pursue the path to the optimal utilization of spectrum and a liberated spectrum management.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed computed tomography (CT) scans from the time of the diagnosis of IPA in 83 hematological malignancy patients with probable or proven IPA according to the EORTC-MSG criteria. We evaluated CT findings (radiological pattern, number of lesions, distribution, and presence of low attenuation area [LAA]), and compared the radiological findings of patients classified by degree of neutropenia with two different indicators (neutrophil count at the onset, and c-d-index) and underlying disease. RESULTS: Neutropenia at the onset of IPA was associated with an increased frequency of LAA (p < 0.05), especially in FN (p < 0.01). Cases with a c-d-index of a?5500 showed an increased incidence of the angio-invasive pattern. In contrast, cases with a c-d-index of 0 showed an increased incidence of the airway-invasive pattern (p < 0.05). The airway-invasive pattern was more frequent in cases with MM, while the angio-invasive pattern was more frequent in cases with AML (p < 0.01). Lower-predominant distribution was more frequent and random distribution was less frequent in cases with AML, random distribution was more frequent and lower-predominant distribution was less frequent in cases with ALL, and upper-predominant distribution was more frequent in cases with MDS (p < 0.05).

It is necessary to pay attention to curricular development and use new educational methods such as virtual education to strengthen information literacy competency in nursing students. Given the scarcity of the studies on the effectiveness of virtual education in nursing, particularly in Iran, and the positive university atmosphere regarding the use of virtual education, this study investigated the effect of virtual education on the undergraduate nursing students information literacy competency for EBP. METHODS: This interventional study was performed with two groups of intervention and control and a pretest and posttest design. Seventy-nine nursing students were selected and assigned to the intervention or control groups by random sampling. Virtual education of the information literacy was uploaded on a website in the form of six modules delivered in four weeks. Questionnaires of demographic information and information literacy for EBP were used to collect data before and one month after the virtual education. RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference between the control and intervention groups in all dimensions of information literacy competency in the pre-test stage. In the post-test, the virtual education improved dimensions of information seeking skills (t = 3.14, p = 0.002) and knowledge about search operators (t = 39.84, p = 0.001) in the intervention groups compared with the control group. The virtual education did not have any significant effect on the use of different information resources and development of search strategy with assessing the frequency of selecting the most appropriate search statement in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Virtual education had a significant effect on information seeking skills and knowledge about search operators in nursing students. Nurse educators can benefit from our experiences in designing this method for the use of virtual education programs in nursing schools. Given the lack of effectiveness of this program in using different information resources and development of search strategy, nurse educators are recommended to train information literacy for EBP by integrating several approaches such as virtual (online and offline) and face-to-face education.","output":"Assessing the effect of virtual education on information literacy competency for evidence-based practice among the undergraduate nursing students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

Ruxolitinib, the first FDA-approved JAK1/2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is efficient in reducing spleen size and improving patient symptoms, but it has not been shown to eradicate the MF clone. In this study, using functional genomics techniques, we identified the proteasome family as an additional therapeutic target and demonstrated that inhibition of the proteasome family by carfilzomib in combination with ruxolitinib enhanced suppression of primary MF cells in vitro. ABSTRACT: As the first FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treatment of patients with myelofibrosis (MF), ruxolitinib improves clinical symptoms but does not lead to eradication of the disease or significant reduction of the mutated allele burden. The resistance of MF clones against the suppressive action of ruxolitinib may be due to intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms leading to activity of additional pro-survival genes or signalling pathways that function independently of JAK2/STAT5. To identify alternative therapeutic targets, we applied a pooled-shRNA library targeting ~5000 genes to a JAK2(V617F)-positive cell line under a variety of conditions, including absence or presence of ruxolitinib and in the presence of a bone marrow microenvironment-like culture medium. We identified several proteasomal gene family members as essential to HEL cell survival. The importance of these genes was validated in MF cells using the proteasomal inhibitor carfilzomib, which also enhanced lethality in combination with ruxolitinib. We also showed that proteasome gene expression is reduced by ruxolitinib in MF CD34(+) cells and that additional targeting of proteasomal activity by carfilzomib enhances the inhibitory action of ruxolitinib in vitro. Hence, this study suggests a potential role for proteasome inhibitors in combination with ruxolitinib for management of MF patients.","output":"Carfilzomib Enhances the Suppressive Effect of Ruxolitinib in Myelofibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to examine the effect of macro-economic variables on the Jakarta composite index in Indonesia, both in the short and long term before Covid19 and the Covid19 period, as well as to examine whether there is a difference before Covid19 and the Covid19 period.

METHODS: Between June 9-August 10, 2020, we conducted a self-administered survey among homeless shelter workers in Washington, Massachusetts, Utah, Maryland, and Georgia. We calculated frequencies for work environment, personal protective equipment use, and SARS-CoV-2 testing history. We used generalized linear models to produce unadjusted prevalence ratios (PR) to assess risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Of the 106 respondents, 43.4% reported frequent close contact with clients; 75% were worried about work-related SARS-CoV-2 infections; 15% reported testing positive. Close contact with clients was associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (PR 3.97, 95%CI 1.06, 14.93). CONCLUSIONS: Homeless shelter workers may be at risk of being exposed to individuals with COVID-19 during the course of their work. Frequent close contact with clients was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction and Objectives: The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been an unmatched challenge to global healthcare. Although the majority of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may not be infected with COVID-19, the quarantine and public health emergency measures may have affected this particular high risk group. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic on ACS admissions and clinical course, in a tertiary care hospital in Portugals most affected region. Methods: This retrospective, case-control study included patients admitted with a diagnosis of ACS during March and April 2020 (pandemic group) and in the same period in2019 (control group). Clinical course and complications were also assessed. Results: During the pandemic, there were fewer ACS admissions but presentation was more severe, with a larger proportion of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (54.9% vs. 38.8%, p= 0.047), higher maximum troponin levels and greater prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at discharge (58.0% vs. 35.0%, p= 0.01). In this population, although not statistically significant, it was observed a delay between the onset of symptoms and percutaneous coronary intervention, which may traduce a deferred search for urgent medical care during the pandemic. Conclusion: The lockdown phase of COVID-19 pandemic was associated with fewer and more severe ACS in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Portugals most affected region by the pandemic.","output":"O impacto da pandemia COVID-19 nas Admiss?es por Sndrome Coronria Aguda num hospital tercirio do Porto"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care is attacked in many contemporary conflicts despite the Geneva Conventions.

The two cases occurred in a husband and wife; the husband is the pastor at a local church (church A). The couple (the index cases) attended church-related events during March 6-8, and developed nonspecific respiratory symptoms and fever on March 10 (wife) and 11 (husband). Before his symptoms had developed, the husband attended a Bible study group on March 11.

METHODS 202 severe asthmatics were studied after 12-120 months of step-5 treatment associated to anti-IgE therapy. Following treatments, reversibility tests, after inhaling 400 mcg of Salbutamol, were performed. FEV1 >12% or 12% changes differentiated RAO+ from RAO- subjects. Blood eosinophil (BE) counts after treatment were considered. RESULTS Pre-/post-treatment bronchodilator FEV1 % and ACT were lower (61%[50-71], 74.4%[62.5-83.7] and 20[18-22]), whereas BE were higher (380 cells/L [170-590]) in RAO+ compared to RAO- subjects (77%[64-88], p=0.0001, 81.8%[66.1-94.3], p=0.0001, 21[18-23], p=0.045 and 230 cells/L [80-360], p=0.003). A negative relationship between SABA-induced FEV1 % changes and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 % (= -0.551%;p=0.0001) and ACT (= -0.059;p=0.038) was found. Conversely, post-treatment BE levels were positively related (=145.565 cells/L;p=0.003) to FEV1 >12% increases. A rising trend of pre-/post-bronchodilator FEV1 % in time was observed in RAO- subjects with BE<300 cells/L. Conversely, we highlighted significant declining tendencies of pre/post-bronchodilator FEV1 % in RAO+ patients with BE>300 cells/L reaching lower values after more than 36 months of step-5 treatment (59.6%[39.9-72.1] vs 74[66.5-89.2] of RAO+ individuals with BE<300 cells/L [p=0.026] and 81.6%[66.1-91.8] of RAO-subjects with BE>300 cells/L [p=0.009]). CONCLUSION Persistent SABA-induced FEV1 >12%, especially when associated to BE>300 cells/mL, may be a marker of accelerated lung function decline in severe asthmatics despite maximal step-5 treatment. The highest bronchodilation associated to the lowest BE levels should be the main goal of asthma treatment to prevent such decline.","output":"Persistence of both reversible airway obstruction and higher blood eosinophils may predict lung function decline in severe asthma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a preventable cardiac condition that escalates risk in pregnancy. Models of care informed by evidence-based clinical guidelines are essential to optimal health outcomes. There are no published reviews that systematically explore approaches to care provision for pregnant women with RHD and examine reported measures. The review objective was to improve understanding of how attributes of care for these women are reported and how they align with guidelines. METHODS A search of 13 databases was supported by hand-searching. Papers that met inclusion criteria were appraised using CASP/JBI checklists. A content analysis of extracted data from the findings sections of included papers was undertaken, informed by attributes of quality care identified previously from existing guidelines. RESULTS The 43 included studies were predominantly conducted in tertiary care centers of low-income and middle-income countries. Cardiac guidelines were referred to in 25 of 43 studies. Poorer outcomes were associated with higher risk scores (detailed in 36 of 41 quantitative studies). Indicators associated with increased risk include anticoagulation during pregnancy (28 of 41 reported) and late booking (gestation documented in 15 of 41 studies). Limited access to cardiac interventions was discussed (19 of 43) in the context of poorer outcomes. Conversely, early assessment and access to regular multidisciplinary care were emphasized in promoting optimal outcomes for women and their babies. CONCLUSIONS Despite often complex care requirements in challenging environments, pregnancy provides an opportunity to strengthen health system responses and address whole-of-life health for women with RHD. A standard set of core indicators is proposed to more accurately benchmark care pathways, outcomes, and burden.","output":"Standardizing clinical care measures of rheumatic heart disease in pregnancy: A qualitative synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37 914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. Method: In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. Results: The optimal parameters were estimated as R0 = 1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47), TI = 14 (interquartile range = 14-14) and TE = 3.0 (interquartile range = 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 47 000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March. Conclusions: The epidemic situation of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan was effectively controlled after the closure of the city, and the disease transmission index also decreased significantly. It is expected that the peak of epidemic situation would be reached in late February and end in March.","output":"When will the battle against novel coronavirus end in Wuhan: A SEIR modeling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evaluation of learners is considered as one of the most important principles in education, especially in the clinical fields. Continuous assessment can be used to provide appropriate feedback to students about their strengths and weaknesses.

METHODS: This study was performed using a combination of qualitative methods, including focus group discussion, expert panel, and Delphi technique. The study population consisted of all the stakeholders involved in the evaluation process of medical residents in Imam Reza Hospital Complex (IRHC) in Iran. This study was conducted in three phases, including identification of subthemes and indicators, production of a primary framework for the SCMAR, and agreement on the subthemes of the SCMAR. The nominal group technique was used for generating priority information. Data analysis was performed during the agreement review stage with the Excel software version 2016. RESULTS: The finalized SCMAR consisted of 10 main themes and 38 subthemes. The themes included objectives, evaluators, areas, and indicators of evaluation, evaluation periods, evaluation requirements, data collection, data sources, point assignment and data analysis methods, reporting, and feedback dissemination methods. Five areas of evaluation and 11 indicators of evaluation were proposed.

We aimed to synthesise the clinical evidence for lopinavir/ritonavir as a treatment for COVID-19. METHODS We performed a rapid review by searching databases including PubMed, GoogleScholar, medRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, for COVID-19 studies comparing outcomes between patients who did and did not receive lopinavir/ritonavir. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. RESULTS We identified five completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 retrospective cohort studies. Two large RCTs of 5040 and 2771 hospitalised adults with COVID-19 found no evidence that lopinavir/ritonavir influenced the primary outcome of mortality, or secondary outcomes including progression to mechanical ventilation or time to discharge. Results remained similar in all sub-group analyses including by age, gender, baseline ventilation and time since symptom onset. Results from one of these trials were only available as a pre-print. The three smaller RCTs (n=86-199) also found no evidence of a benefit in the primary outcomes of time to clinical improvement or time to viral clearance. The 14 observational studies included between 50 and 415 participants, and were limited by a lack of adjustment for potential confounding variables. The majority of these studies found no evidence that lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with improved mortality or other clinical outcomes, although results regarding viral clearance were mixed. CONCLUSIONS Good evidence from large clinical trials does not support using lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19 amongst hospitalised patients.","output":"The protease inhibitor lopinavir, boosted with ritonavir, as treatment for COVID-19: a rapid review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meer dan twee miljoen Nederlanders hebben moeite met lezen en schrijven.

This continuously presents the host immune system with new challenges. On the other side of the trenches, an increasingly well\\\\adjusted host immune response, shaped by coevolutionary history, makes a pathogen's life a rather complicated endeavor. It is, therefore, no surprise that pathogens either escape detection or modulate the host immune response, often by redirecting normal cellular pathways to their advantage. For the purpose of this chapter, we focus mainly on the manipulation of the class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen presentation pathways and the ubiquitin (Ub)\\\\proteasome system by both viral and bacterial pathogens. First, we describe the general features of antigen presentation pathways and the Ub\\\\proteasome system and then address how they are manipulated by pathogens. We discuss the many human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)\\\\encoded immunomodulatory genes that interfere with antigen presentation (immunoevasins) and focus on the HCMV immunoevasins US2 and US11, which induce the degradation of class I MHC heavy chains by the proteasome by catalyzing their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\\\\membrane into the cytosol, a process termed ER dislocation. US2\\\\ and US11\\\\mediated subversion of ER dislocation ensures proteasomal degradation of class I MHC molecules and presumably allows HCMV to avoid recognition by cytotoxic T cells, whilst providing insight into general aspects of ER\\\\associated degradation (ERAD) which is used by eukaryotic cells to purge their ER of defective proteins. We discuss the similarities and differences between the distinct pathways co\\\\opted by US2 and US11 for dislocation and degradation of human class I MHC molecules and also a putatively distinct pathway utilized by the murine herpes virus (MHV)\\\\68 mK3 immunoevasin for ER dislocation of murine class I MHC. We speculate on the implications of the three pathogen\\\\exploited dislocation pathways to cellular ER quality control.

Factors of substrate composition, operating phase, electrode material, configuration, and pre-treatments employed were considered. The meta-analysis results indicate that dual-chamber MFCs overall achieve 18% higher COD removal and 73% higher coulombic efficiencies over that of single-chamber MFCs. MFCs using a solid operating phase achieved ??38% higher coulombic efficiencies than those using a liquid operating phase. Statistical analyses comparing brush vs flat surface anodes revealed that brush anodes can achieve 130% higher power density than flat surface anodes. The use of a platinum catalyst was found to improve power density, as opposed to catalyst-free cathodes. However, coulombic efficiency is less likely to be influenced by the catalyst used and more likely to be dependent on the inclusion of a membrane separator. The meta-analysis results indicate that even in the presence of expensive catalysts like platinum, membrane separators are of prime importance to maintain a stable MFC operation on a long-term basis and achieve high coulombic efficiency in an MFC. Results presented in this paper outline the impact of MFC design choices on performance and can be used to guide future MFC research. These findings can be beneficial for municipalities as it provides a pathway for future MFC design and optimization by analyzing critical associations between MFC response parameters and multiple varying factors.","output":"Meta-analysis of operational performance and response metrics of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) fed with complex food waste"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Denial of pregnancy is a condition in which a pregnant patient does not believe she is pregnant.

Broad rewiring of intracellular metabolism and enhanced autophagic flux occurred in inflammasome-activated macrophages, but neither was necessary for the PDHK-regulated reduction of NLRP3 inflammasome activity. PDHK inhibition protected against inflammation-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodeling and improved mitochondrial function by repurposing mitochondria from ROS production to ATP generation. Inhibition of PDHK increased the expression of the mitochondrial fusion protein optic atrophy-1 (OPA1). Suppression of OPA1 partially reversed the effect of PDHK inhibition on NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Feedback was gathered from students and instructors using the evaluation of technology-enhanced learning materials (ETELM). Patient feedback was gathered using the Communication Assessment Tool to explore any impact on interpersonal communication. RESULTS: The response rate for the ETELM-learner perceptions was 58% (31/53), 100% for the ETELM-instructor perceptions. Students strongly agreed that the overall quality of the teaching session and instructors was excellent. However, 32% experienced issues with audio or video quality and one remote student reported cyber sickness.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms connecting these GI symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain elusive. Previous studies indicate that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into intestinal cells leads to downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors resulting in impaired barrier function. While intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the amino acid transporter B0AT1, the B0AT1/ACE2 complex within the intestinal epithelium acts as a regulator of gut microbiota composition and function. Alternations to the B0AT1/ACE2 complex lead to microbial dysbiosis through increased local and systemic immune responses. Previous studies have also suggested that altered serotonin metabolism may be the underlying cause of GI disorders involving diarrhea. The findings of elevated plasma serotonin levels and high fecal calprotectin in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea indicate that the viral infection evokes a systemic inflammatory response that specifically involves the GI. Interestingly, the elevated proinflammatory cytokines correlate with elevated serotonin and fecal calprotectin levels further supporting the evidence of GI inflammation, a hallmark of functional GI disorders. Moreover, the finding that rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients remain positive for SARS-CoV-2 even after the nasopharynx clears the virus, suggests that viral replication and shedding from the GI tract may be more robust than that of the respiratory tract, further indicating fecal-oral transmission as another important route of viral spread.

The efficient ability of p22 to suppress RNA silencing, triggered by hairpin transcripts transiently expressed in planta, supports the relationship between its ability to bind dsRNA in vitro and its ability to inhibit RNA silencing in vivo.","output":"The p22 RNA silencing suppressor of the crinivirus Tomato chlorosis virus preferentially binds long dsRNAs preventing them from cleavage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cross-national survey data shows that for a significant share of European citizens, corruption is acceptable. Notwithstanding the importance of prior knowledge on corruption extension and experience, research has made little progress in exploring why people condone it, especially in unsuspicious countries, with effective institutions and stable democratic rules and processes. The present study examines this gap in the literature by assessing the European Values Study (EVS) and the Special Eurobarometer (EB) attempts at measuring Tolerance towards Corruption (TtC) in OECD countries in Europe during the same period (2017C2019). In the end, measurements proved to be constrained by the limited number of questions/items that try to capture TtC, which gave room to conclude that: (a) EVS and EB approaches do not measure the same TtC. The first measures it through social transgressions not exclusively related to corruption, while the second measures the willingness to accept a public-office corruption when dealing with the public sphere. (b) Lower ages combined with individual preferences/perceptions of less satisfaction with life, widespread corruption, and prior experiences with corruption proved to be more relevant to explain TtC, regardless of the country in which individuals were surveyed. (c) The type of TtC citizens display in advanced democracies proved to be mainly contingent on their age and on the way they interpret the extension of corruption and the prior contact they had with a public-office corruption in a given society.

Hospital Kuala Lumpur, where thoracic procedures are performed, was badly affected. We describe our experience in performing aerosol generating procedures safely in thoracic surgery during the Covid-19 era. METHODS: Medical records of patients who underwent thoracic surgery from March 18, 2020 to May 17, 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients undergoing thoracic surgery were tested for Covid-19 using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. Patients with malignancy were observed for 10 to 14 days in the ward after testing negative. The healthcare workers donned personal protective equipment for all the cases, and the number of healthcare workers in the operating room was limited to the minimum required. RESULTS: A total of 44 procedures were performed in 26 thoracic surgeries. All of these procedures were classified as aerosol generating, and the mean duration of the surgery was 130  43 minutes. None of the healthcare workers involved in the surgery were exposed or infected by Covid-19. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 will be a threat for a long time and thoracic surgeons must continue to provide their services, despite having to deal with aerosol generating procedures, in the new normal. Covid-19 testing of all surgical candidates, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, donning full personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, and carefully planned procedures are among the measures suggested to prevent unnecessary Covid-19 exposure in thoracic surgery.","output":"Aerosol-generating procedures in thoracic surgery in the COVID-19 era in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The twenty-first century has witnessed a wave of severe infectious disease outbreaks, not least the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a devastating impact on lives and livelihoods around the globe.

Due to the mechanical strain of ventilation, damage can occur in the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium resulting in a cascade of events that may be fatal to the patients. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation are often critically ill, which limits the possibility of obtaining patient samples, making VILI research challenging. In vitro models are very important for VILI research, but the complexity of the cellular interactions in multi-organ animals, necessitates in vivo studies where the mouse model is a common choice. However, the settings and duration of ventilation used to create VILI in mice vary greatly, causing uncertainty in interpretation and comparison of results. This review examines approaches to induce VILI in mouse models for the last 10 years, to our best knowledge, summarizing methods and key parameters presented across the studies.

Our LM and XGBoost estimates bring EPU closer to the stylized facts of uncertainty than other uncertainty estimates. LM and XGBoost indicators are more countercyclical and have more pronounced leading properties. We find that EPU is more strongly correlated to financial volatility measures than to consumers assessments of uncertainty. This corroborates that the media place a much higher weight on the financial sector than on the economic issues of consumers. Further on, we considerably widen the scope of search terms included in the calculation of EPU index. Using ensemble learning techniques on such a rich set of keywords, we mostly manage to outperform the standard EPU in terms of correlation with standard uncertainty proxies. We also find that the predictive accuracy of EPU index can be considerably increased using a more diversified set of uncertainty-related terms than the original EPU framework.

The impact of DM on public health in developing countries has triggered alarm due to the exaggerated costs of the treatment and monitoring of patients with this disease. Considerable efforts have been made to try to prevent the onset and reduce the complications of DM. However, because insulin-producing pancreatic -cells progressively deteriorate, many people must receive insulin through subcutaneous injection. Additionally, current therapies do not have consistent results regarding the prevention of chronic complications. Leveraging the approval of real-time continuous glucose monitors and sophisticated algorithms that partially automate insulin infusion pumps has improved glycemic control, decreasing the burden of diabetes management. However, these advances are facing physiologic barriers. New findings in molecular and cellular biology have produced an extraordinary advancement in tissue development for the treatment of DM. Obtaining pancreatic -cells from somatic cells is a great resource that currently exists for patients with DM. Although this therapeutic option has great prospects for patients, some challenges remain for this therapeutic plan to be used clinically. The purpose of this review is to describe the new techniques in cell biology and regenerative medicine as possible treatments for DM.

The combination of ITV and supraglottic airway devices (SADs) has not been previously studied. This simulation study in a manikin aimed at analysing differences in ventilation with different SADs without and with an ITV. METHODS In a resuscitation manikin, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed with interrupted (30:2) and continuous chest compressions using facemask, tracheal tube and 10 SADs (six different laryngeal masks, LT-D, LTS-D, Combitube((R)) and Easy Tube((R))). Ventilation was performed with and without an ITV. A total of 550 CPR cycles of 3-min duration were performed with chest compressions and ventilation standardised by use of a mechanical thumper device and an emergency ventilator. RESULTS Sufficient ventilation was possible with all devices tested. For ventilation during continuous chest compressions, there were significantly reduced tidal volumes for all airway devices with ITV use. By contrast, during interrupted chest compressions, no differences in tidal volumes with the ITV occurred in the majority of devices. The maximum reduction of tidal volume for any device was 7.8% of the volume reached without the ITV. CONCLUSION Based on the findings of this manikin trial, the use of an ITV for ventilation during CPR is possible in combination with supraglottic airway devices. Merging these two strategies warrants further clinical evaluation to judge the relevance of tidal volume reduction found in this trial.","output":"Influence of an impedance threshold valve on ventilation with supraglottic airway devices during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a manikin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic will have impacts that will vary across countries and commodity sectors, reflecting factors such as the importance of trade, differences in the functioning of supply chains and the market which producers and farmers supply Some of these effects will be relatively short-lived;others will be longer-lasting In this context, we set out the channels through which food prices will be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, emphasising the short-and longer-term nature of the main effects We focus on the UK but the insights extend to other (importing) countries Drawing on a recent econometric model of UK retail food prices that accounts for both domestic and international factors, we show that the key drivers have potentially off-setting effects, suggesting that the Covid-19 shock to the food sector is likely to be different from previous shocks, particularly the commodity price crises of 2007-2008 and 2011 In many European countries, the Covid-19 pandemic may manifest itself as something of an 'odd crisis', in which lower world and farm-gate prices co-exist with higher domestic retail prices These off-setting factors will frame policy responses targeted at different stages of the food chain across countries","output":"An Odd Crisis: Covid-19 and UK Food Prices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic led many countries to implement lockdown measures.

To combat the spread of the virus and prevent an uncontrolled outbreak with limited resources, national lockdown protocols have taken effect in the Netherlands since March 13(th), 2020. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, type and characteristics of HEMS and HEMS-ambulance Lifeliner 1 dispatches during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period one year prior. METHODS: A retrospective review of all HEMS and HEMS-ambulance Lifeliner 1 dispatches was performed from the start of Dutch nationwide lockdown orders from March 13th until May 13th, 2020 and the corresponding period one year prior. Dispatch-, operational-, patient-, injury-, and on-site treatment characteristics were extracted for analysis. In addition, the rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel and the time physicians were unable to take call was described. RESULTS: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HEMS and HEMS-ambulance was requested in 528 cases. One year prior, a total of 620 requests were received. The HEMS (helicopter and ambulance) was cancelled after deployment in 56.4% of the COVID-19 cohort and 50.7% of the historical cohort (P = 0.05). Incident location type did not differ between the two cohorts, specifically, there was no significant difference in the number of injuries that occurred at home in pandemic versus non-pandemic circumstances. Besides a decrease in the number of falls, the distribution of mechanisms of injury remained similar during the COVID-19 study period. There was no difference in self-inflicted injuries observed. Prehospital interventions remained similar during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to one year prior. Specifically, prehospital intubation did not differ between the two cohorts. The rate of COVID-19 positively tested HEMS personnel was 23.1%. Physicians who tested positive were unable to take call for a mean of 25 days (range 8C53).

After making a 17- to 25-mm single incision in the 6th intercostal space (6ICS) at the median axillary line, the visceral pleura near the bulla was sutured for traction. The parietal pleura at 3ICS was then sutured from the thoracic cavity to serve as the chest wall pulley and a traction thread was passed through the pulley. By manipulating the traction thread, it was possible to move the lesion to an arbitrary site for excision. The postoperative scar was nearly invisible. RESULTS The operative time, duration of postoperative drainage, and postoperative hospital stay were equivalent for PulLE vs. cVATS.

People have little information about SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus). Internet has become a frequently used tool to obtain information in recent years, while YouTube is one of the popular sources of information with many videos on its platform. This study aims to identify the topics regarding Coronavirus that people learned about on YouTube. The videos about Coronavirus were also evaluated in terms of the reliability of their source of information. METHODS: In total, 160 videos on Coronavirus that had 500,000 or more views were analysed. The latent Dirichlet allocation method was used in the process of identifying the topics that were then compared in terms of video parameters. The reliability of the source of information provided by videos was assessed with a modified DISCERN tool. RESULTS: A proportion of 15.6 % of these videos had a scientific content, while 45 % of these videos were about the process entailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of video reliability, the difference between video types was found to be significant; videos with scientific content had more reliable sources of information (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: It has been determined that the videos about the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, and those with scientific content have the most reliable source of information on Coronavirus (Tab. 5, Fig. 1, Ref. 35).

There are few studies which assessed standard electrocardiogram (ECG) as a prognostic tool during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to identify the relationship between of ECG parameters and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHOD AND RESULTS: A total of 114 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and May 2020 were included in the study. Standard 12-lead surface ECG was reviewed for presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS), abnormal Q wave, T wave inversion, and duration of QRS. fQRS was observed in 36.8% (n = 42) of the patients who had SARS-CoV-2. Patient groups with and without fQRS did not differ in terms of age, gender, the presence of comorbid diseases and medical treatment. Hospitalization duration, intensive care unit(ICU) requirement, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality were found to be higher in patients with fQRS (all p values <0.05). There was a positive correlation between QRS duration and duration of hospital stay (p < 0.001, r = 0.421). QRS duration was also found to be associated with intensive care need, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality. CONCLUSION: Our data shows that QRS duration and the presence of fQRS on standard ECG can help to identify patients with worse clinical outcome admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Fragmented QRS on surface electrocardiography as a predictor of cardiac mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Baricitinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor that was first approved for treating moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but that later showed considerable efficacy in the control of exaggerated inflammatory responses that occur in a wide range of diseases.

The current review aims to generate more accurate and useful findings by (1) a detailed analysis of intervention elements that change behaviour (i.e. behaviour change techniques (BCTs)) and potential moderators of behaviour change (i.e. other intervention and sample characteristics) and (2) assessing and controlling for variability in support provided to comparison groups in smoking cessation trials. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted of randomized controlled trials of behaviour change interventions for smoking cessation in adults (with or without pharmacological support), with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, published after 1995. Eligible articles will be identified through the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register. Study authors will be asked for detailed descriptions of smoking cessation support provided to intervention and comparison groups. All data will be independently coded by two researchers. The BCT taxonomy v1 (tailored to smoking cessation interventions) and template for intervention description and replication criteria will be used to code intervention characteristics. Data collection will further include sample and trial characteristics and outcome data (smoking cessation rates). Multilevel mixed-effects meta-regression models will be used to examine which BCTs and/or BCT clusters delivered to intervention and comparison groups explain smoking cessation rates in treatment arms (and effect sizes) and what key moderators of behaviour change are. Predicted effect sizes of each intervention will be computed assuming all interventions are compared against comparison groups receiving the same levels of behavioural support (i.e. low, medium, and high levels). Multi-disciplinary advisory board members (policymakers, health care providers, and (ex-)smokers) will provide strategic input throughout the project to ensure the review's applicability to policy and practice. DISCUSSION By capturing BCTs in intervention and comparison groups, this systematic review will provide more accurate estimates of the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, the most promising BCTs and/or BCT clusters associated with smoking cessation rates in intervention and comparison arms, and important moderators of behaviour change. The results could set new standards for conducting meta-analyses of behaviour change interventions and improve research, service delivery, and training in the area of smoking cessation.

However, easily implemented approaches to assess the actual environmental threat are currently unavailable. We present a simple approach with the potential to rapidly provide information about the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the atmosphere at any location. We used a portable dehumidifier as a readily available and affordable tool to collect airborne virus in the condensate. The dehumidifiers were deployed in selected locations of a hospital ward with patients reporting flu-like symptoms which could possibly be due to COVID-19 over three separate periods of one week. Samples were analyzed frequently for both virus envelope protein and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In several samples across separate deployments, condensate from dehumidifiers tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens as confirmed using two independent assays. RNA was detected, but not attributable to SARS-CoV-2. We verified the ability of the dehumidifier to rapidly collect aerosolized sodium chloride. Our results point to a facile pool testing method to sample air in any location in the world and assess the presence and concentration of an infectious agent to obtain quantitative risk assessment of exposure, designate zones as \\"hot spots\\" and minimize the need for individual testing which may often be time consuming, expensive, and laborious.","output":"Rapid and low-cost sampling for detection of airborne SARS-CoV-2 in dehumidifier condensate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective.

Women with ARDs want their motherhood identities and associated preferences to be taken into account in decisions about their healthcare. The aim of this study was to explore the interplay between illness and motherhood identities of women with ARDs during preconception decision making. Methods: Timeline-facilitated qualitative interviews with women diagnosed with an ARD (18-49 years old). Participants were purposively sampled based on the following three criteria: thinking about getting pregnant, currently pregnant, or had young children. Interviews were thematically analysed. Results: Twenty-two women were interviewed face-to-face (N=6) or over the telephone (N=16). Interview length ranged from 20 minutes to 70 minutes, with a mean length of 48 minutes. Three main themes were identified: prioritisation, discrepancy, and trade-off. Difficulties in balancing multiple identities in healthcare encounters were reported. Women used self-guides as a reference for priority setting in a dynamic process that shifted as their level of disease activity altered and as their motherhood identity became more or less of a focus at a given point in time. Womens illness and motherhood identities did not present in isolation but were intertwined.

All patients underwent in-laboratory attended PSG and image processing with SW simultaneously overnight. Subsequently, a HSAT and image processing with SW were performed simultaneously overnight at patients' home, and the 2 nights after, patients underwent only image processing with SW consecutively. RESULTS In-laboratory polysomnography and SW had a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.933 and a  of 0.930.

Methods We analysed data collected during the International Surgical Outcomes Study, an international 7-day cohort study of adults undergoing elective inpatient surgery. Hospitals were ranked by quintiles according to surgical procedural volume (Q1 lowest to Q5 highest). For each quintile we assessed in-hospital complications rates, mortality, and failure-to-rescue. We repeated this analysis ranking hospitals by risk-adjusted complication rates (Q1 lowest to Q5 highest). Results A total of 44 814 patients from 474 hospitals in 27 low-, middle-, and high-income countries were available for analysis. Of these, 7508 (17%) developed one or more postoperative complication, with 207 deaths in hospital (0.5%), giving an overall failure-to-rescue rate of 2.8%. When hospitals were ranked in quintiles by procedural volume, we identified a three-fold variation in mortality (Q1: 0.6% vs Q5: 0.2%) and a two-fold variation in failure-to-rescue (Q1: 3.6% vs Q5: 1.7%). Ranking hospitals in quintiles by risk-adjusted complication rate further confirmed the presence of important variations in failure-to-rescue, indicating differences between hospitals in the risk of death among patients after they develop complications.

We searched for patients with sarcoidosis presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines) among those included in the SarcoGEAS Registry, a nationwide, multicenter registry of patients fulfilling the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders 1999 classification criteria for sarcoidosis. A 2:1 age-sex-matched subset of patients with sarcoidosis without SARS-CoV-2 infection was selected as control population. Forty-five patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified (28 women, mean age 55 years). Thirty-six patients presented a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and 14 were hospitalized (12 required supplemental oxygen, 2 intensive care unit admission and 1 mechanical ventilation). Four patients died due to progressive respiratory failure. Patients who required hospital admission had an older mean age (64.9 vs. 51.0 years, p = 0.006), a higher frequency of baseline comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (64% vs. 23%, p = 0.016), diabetes mellitus (43% vs. 13%, p = 0.049) and chronic liver/kidney diseases (36% vs. 0%, p = 0.002) and presented more frequently fever (79% vs. 35%, p = 0.011) and dyspnea (50% vs. 3%, p = 0.001) in comparison with patients managed at home. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariate analysis identified the age at diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection as the only independent variable associated with hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio 1.18, 95% conficence interval 1.04-1.35). A baseline moderate/severe pulmonary impairment in function tests was associated with a higher rate of hospitalization but the difference was not statistically significant (50% vs. 23%, p = 0.219). A close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly patients with sarcoidosis, especially in those with baseline cardiopulmonary diseases and chronic liver or renal failure, is recommended. The low frequency of severe pulmonary involvement in patients with sarcoidosis from Southern Europe may explain the weak prognostic role of baseline lung impairment in our study, in contrast to studies from other geographical areas.","output":"Characterization and Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients with Sarcoidosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected millions of citizens worldwide and claimed many lives.

One of these stated increasing rates of fears and mental stress of tumor patients. Now we aimed to analyze whether tumor patients did perceive changes in their attitudes and behaviors related to their relationships, awareness of nature and quietness, interest in spiritual issues, or feelings of worries and isolation. A further point of interest was how these perceived changes could be predicted, either by meaning in life, spirituality as a resource to cope, perceived fears and worries, or particularly by their wellbeing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online survey with standardized questionnaires (i.e., WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO5), Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), Spiritual and Religious Attitudes to cope with illness (SpREUK-15), Gratitude/Awe scale (GrAw-7)) among 292 tumor patients (72% men; mean age 66.7  10.8 years; 25% < 60 years, 33% 60-70 years, 41% > 70 years) from Germany between May 6 to June 10, 2020. RESULTS: Patients wellbeing (WHO5) scores were in the lower range (14.7  6.0); 35% scored < 13, indicating depressive states. Wellbeing was significantly higher in older persons and lower in younger ones (F=11.1, p<.0001). Most were irritated by different statements about the danger and the course of the corona infection in the public media (60%), and 57% were worrying to be infected and to have a complicated course of disease. Because of the restrictions, patients noticed changes in their attitudes and behaviors (measured with the 12-item Perceptions of Change Scale): 1) Perception of nature and silence (Cronbachs alpha = .82), 2) Worrying reflections and loneliness (Cronbachs alpha = .80), 3) Interest in spirituality (Cronbachs alpha = .91), 4) Intense relationships (Cronbachs alpha = .64). These perceptions of change were similar in women and men, age groups and also with respect to tumor stages. Regression analyses revealed that the factor Perception of nature and silence was predicted best by patients ability to value and experience the wonder of the present moment (in terms of wondering awe and gratitude) and by patients search for meaning in life. The factor Worrying reflections and loneliness was predicted best by their search for meaning in life and by feelings of being under pressure because of the Corona pandemic. Interest in spirituality was predicted best by search for an access to a spiritual source and by frequency of praying. Intense relationships were explained with weak predictive power by patients ability to reflect life concerns. Patients wellbeing during the Corona pandemic was predicted (R(2) =.57) by a mix of disease and pandemic related stressor, and by available resources (meaning in life and religious trust). CONCLUSION: In this study among tumor patients from a secular society the topics meaning in life, having (religious) trust, stable relationships, mindful encounter with nature, and times of reflection were found to be of importance. To overcome tumor patients feelings of isolation, depressive states, and insecurity about future perspectives, further support is needed, particularly in their socio-spatial surrounding. These are the domains of psychotherapy and spiritual care. The planned integration of structured access to spiritual care seems to be important, not only for the field of cancer care. As the findings refer to patients self-perceptions, longitudinal studies are required to substantiate these perceived changes.","output":"Tumor Patients Perceived Changes of Specific Attitudes, Perceptions, and Behaviors Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Relation to Reduced Wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Diabetes is reported as a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but whether this risk is similar in all categories of age remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients with and without diabetes according to age categories. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 6314 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between February and 30 June 2020 in the Paris metropolitan area, France; follow-up was recorded until 30 September 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) The main outcome was a composite outcome of mortality and orotracheal intubation in subjects with diabetes compared with subjects without diabetes, after adjustment for confounding variables and according to age categories. RESULTS Diabetes was recorded in 39% of subjects. Main outcome was higher in patients with diabetes, independently of confounding variables (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13 [1.03-1.24]) and increased with age in individuals without diabetes, from 23% for those <50 to 35% for those >80 years but reached a plateau after 70 years in those with diabetes. In direct comparison between patients with and without diabetes, diabetes-associated risk was inversely proportional to age, highest in <50 years and similar after 70 years. Similarly, mortality was higher in patients with diabetes (26%) than in those without diabetes (22%, P < 0.001), but adjusted HR for diabetes was significant only in patients younger than age 50 years (HR 1.81 [1.14-2.87]).

It is unknown how alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects the severity and mortality of COVID\\\\19. AUD is known to increase the severity and mortality of bacterial pneumonia and the risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our objective is to determine whether individuals with AUD have increased severity and mortality from COVID\\\\19. METHODS: We utilized a retrospective cohort study of inpatients and outpatients from 44 centers participating in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. All were adult COVID\\\\19 patients with and without documented AUDs. RESULTS: We identified 25,583 COVID\\\\19 patients with an AUD and 1,309,445 without. In unadjusted comparisons, those with AUD had higher odds of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] 2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94 to 2.06, p < 0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, and comorbidities, individuals with an AUD still had higher odds of requiring hospitalization (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.51, CI 1.46 to 1.56, p < 0.001). In unadjusted comparisons, individuals with AUD had higher odds of all\\\\cause mortality (OR 2.18, CI 2.05 to 2.31, p < 0.001). After adjustment as above, individuals with an AUD still had higher odds of all\\\\cause mortality (aOR 1.55, CI 1.46 to 1.65, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This work suggests that AUD can increase the severity and mortality of COVID\\\\19 infection. This reinforces the need for clinicians to obtain an accurate alcohol history from patients hospitalized with COVID\\\\19. For this study, our results are limited by an inability to quantify the daily drinking habits of the participants.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A systematic review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies reporting clinical data for OLTPs were included. The LOE and QOE of the included studies were evaluated using a 5-level grading system and the modified Coleman Methodology Score, respectively. RESULTS: Included were 20 studies with 426 OLTPs; 4 studies were LOE 2 and 16 studies were LOE 4. Overall, 86.7% of OLTPs were associated with a traumatic history and/or previous ankle sprain. OLTPs were most commonly located in the centromedial region of the tibial plafond (30.4%), with the fewest number of OLTPs found in the anteromedial region of the tibial plafond (3.9%). In 17 of the studies, a total of 46.9% of OLTPs were associated with coexisting osteochondral lesions of the talus. The most frequently used surgical technique to treat OLTPs was microfracture, which resulted in good clinical outcomes at midterm follow-up.

Virus isolation was successful from NPS from all age groups, with a median initial VL of 1.7x108 copies/ml (mean 7.9x108, IQR 4.7x106-1.0x109) (Figure 1). The youngest patient that SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from was a 7-day old neonate. No correlation between disease presentation and success of virus isolation was observed. Our data show that initial VLs at diagnosis in symptomatic children is comparable to those in adults, and that symptomatic children of all ages shed infectious virus in early acute illness. Infectious virus isolation success was largely comparable to that of adults, although two specimens yielded an isolate at a lower VL (1.2x104 and 1.4x105 copies/ml) than what was observed in adults. SARS-CoV-2 shedding patterns of culture competent virus in symptomatic children resemble those observed in adults. Therefore, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children is plausible. Considering the relatively low frequency of infected children at this time, biological or other unknown factors could reduce transmission in this population. Both large serological investigations and systematic surveillance of acute respiratory diseases are needed to understand the role of children in this new pandemic.","output":"Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic neonates, children and adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in the proportion of employees for whom teleworking became mandatory. Presenteeism, or the behavior of working while ill, has hardly been studied in the context of telework. The pandemic forced millions of workers to abruptly transition to working from home for a prolonged period of time, leaving employers often unaware of their health status or work capacity of the workers. This change also eroded the work experience itself, the workplace, and their protective impact on both individual health and work outcomes. This study focused on the longitudinal relationships among psychosocial safety climate (PSC), a lead indicator of workplace conditions, psychological demands, an indicator of quality of work, and presenteeism among a representative sample of teleworkers. PSC was expected to have an indirect impact on presenteeism with psychological demands as a mediator of this impact. Method: We collected the data from a representative sample of teleworkers in the first months (T1: April, T2: June, and T3: December 2020) of the pandemic using a three-wave online survey (n = 275). We tested a model of PSC as a determinant of presenteeism in teleworkers with psychological demands as a mediator. A cross-lagged panel model was estimated to test cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships. Findings: As expected, psychological demands increased over time. Contrary to expectations, the prevalence of presenteeism remained unchanged while PSC increased over time. The data fully supported the mediating effect of psychological demands such that a higher evaluation of PSC at T1 led to lower psychological demands at T2, which led to reduced presenteeism at T3. We also found a reciprocal relationship, with higher psychological demands at T2 leading to decreased evaluation of PSC at T3. These results show that the perception of teleworkers on their organization as giving a high priority to their psychological health is an important determinant of their work experience, ultimately influencing their decision to work while ill. The context of the pandemic has highlighted the importance of a positive workplace climate and working conditions for reducing the behaviors that can be harmful to health and productivity. Implications for theory and practice, beyond the pandemic, are discussed.","output":"Teleworking While Sick: A Three-Wave Study of Psychosocial Safety Climate, Psychological Demands, and Presenteeism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The prevalence of mental health problems and substance abuse in the migrant population is higher than the general population. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To assess the prevalence and pattern of mental health issues and substance use in the migrant population and highlight the association with the reverse migration of migrant workers. METHODOLOGY The field staff visited the shelter homes for migrant population in four cities of Northern India (Chandigarh (UT), Bhatinda (Punjab), Panchkula (Haryana) and Jaipur (Rajasthan). After maintaining the social distance and wearing masks by the staff and migrants, written informed consent was taken for participation in the study. The socio-demographic details of reverse migrants were noted down and Hindi version of Primary Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for mental health problems and screening tool for pattern of substance abuse was administered. Geographically matched undisplaced were also administered these tools. RESULTS A total of 275 reverse migrants and 276 undisplaced were included in the study. The prevalence of ever use for all the substances among reverse migrants was 44.4% (122/275) and among undisplaced, it was 45.3%. The prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis was higher than the general population. The prevalence of at least one diagnosis on PHQ-9 is 13.45% (reverse migrants 19.3% and undisplaced 7.6) and the prevalence of other depressive disorder is significantly higher in reverse migrants (17.1%) than undisplaced (4.0%).

The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 shows that the virus enters host cells by first binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Therefore, blocking the binding between of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD can inhibit the virus infection in the host cells. In this study, by grafting the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of developed SARS-CoV, MERS-CoVs specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as SARS-CoV-2 mAbs onto a known stable nanobody (Nb) scaffold, and a total of 16 Nbs sequences were designed. Five Nbs, namely CS01, CS02, CS03, CS10, and CS16, were selected based on the free energy landscape of protein docking verified by the recently reported Nb-RBD cocrystal structures. CS01, CS02, and CS03 occupied the ACE2 binding site of RBD, while CS10 and CS16 were proposed to inhibit the interaction between RBD and ACE2 through an allosteric mechanism. Based on the structures of the five Nbs in complex with RBD, seven brand-new Nbs with enhanced binding affinities (CS02_RD01, CS03_RD01, CS03_RD02, CS03_RD03, CS03_RD04, CS16_RD01, and CS16_RD02) were generated by redesign of residues on the interface of the five Nbs contact with SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

SETTING The follow-up was conducted at a university hospital as well as in a private practice institution in France. METHODS Eighty patients operated on between February 2002 and May 2006 were reviewed. Weight outcomes were analyzed as well as complete biological status. Revisions were reported as well as the number of patients taking vitamin supplementation. RESULTS A follow-up of 141  16 months was available for 87.7% of the patients at least 10 years from surgery. Preoperative BMI decreased from 48.9  7.3 to 31.2  6.2 kg/m2 with an EWL of 73.4  26.7% and a TWL of 35.9%  17.7%. Despite weight regain 10% of the weight loss in 61% of the cases, 78% of the patients maintained a BMI <35. Fourteen percent of the patients had a revision.

In this paper, we introduce a new class of large telescope based on these advances: an all-sky, arcsecond-resolution, 1000-telescope array which builds a simultaneously high-cadence and deep survey by observing the entire sky all night. As a concrete example, we describe the Argus Array, a 5m-class telescope with an all-sky field of view and the ability to reach extremely high cadences using low-noise CMOS detectors. Each 55 GPix Argus exposure covers 20% of the entire sky to g=19.6 each minute and g=21.9 each hour; a high-speed mode will allow sub-second survey cadences for short times. Deep coadds will reach g=23.6 every five nights over 47% of the sky; a larger-aperture array telescope, with an \\\\'etendue close to the Rubin Observatory, could reach g=24.3 in five nights. These arrays can build two-color, million-epoch movies of the sky, enabling sensitive and rapid searches for high-speed transients, fast-radio-burst counterparts, gravitational-wave counterparts, exoplanet microlensing events, occultations by distant solar system bodies, and myriad other phenomena. An array of O(1,000) telescopes, however, would be one of the most complex astronomical instruments yet built. Standard arrays with hundreds of tracking mounts entail thousands of moving parts and exposed optics, and maintenance costs would rapidly outpace the mass-produced-hardware cost savings compared to a monolithic large telescope. We discuss how to greatly reduce operations costs by placing all optics in a thermally controlled, sealed dome with a single moving part. Coupled with careful software scope control and use of existing pipelines, we show that the Argus Array could become the deepest and fastest Northern sky survey, with total costs below $20M.","output":"Low-Cost Access to the Deep, High-Cadence Sky: the Argus Optical Array"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein composition is restricted by the genetic code to a relatively small number of natural amino acids Similarly, the known three-dimensional structures adopt a limited number of protein folds However, proteins exert a large variety of functions and show a remarkable ability for regulation and immediate response to intracellular and extracellular stimuli To some degree, the wide variability of protein function can be attributed to the post-translational modifications Post-translational modifications have been observed in all kingdoms of life and give to proteins a significant degree of chemical and consequently functional and structural diversity Their importance is partly reflected in the large number of genes dedicated to their regulation So far, hundreds of post-translational modifications have been observed while it is believed that many more are to be discovered along with the technological advances in sequencing, proteomics, mass spectrometry and structural biology Indeed, the number of studies which report novel post translational modifications is getting larger supporting the notion that their space is still largely unexplored In this review we explore the impact of post-translational modifications on protein structure and function with emphasis on catalytic activity regulation We present examples of proteins and protein families whose catalytic activity is substantially affected by the presence of post translational modifications and we describe the molecular basis which underlies the regulation of the protein function through these modifications When available, we also summarize the current state of knowledge on the mechanisms which introduce these modifications to protein sites","output":"Catalytic activity regulation through post-translational modification: the expanding universe of protein diversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Traumatic injury sits at the nexus of law enforcement and structural racism.

Several studies show that depression is highly prevalent among quarantined individuals. COVID-19 is a pandemic with a rapidly increasing incidence of infections and deaths. People are depressed and psychologically overwhelmed by the illness and possible loss of their friends and loved ones. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression symptoms among quarantined individuals in Tigrai treatment center, Tigrai, Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: A multicenter Institution-based cross-sectional study was employed among individuals in the Tigrai quarantine centers. A simple random sampling technique was used between April and October 2020 until an adequate sample size was reached. Depression was assessed by using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS). Epi data manager version 4.4 was used to enter data and data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. Logistic regression was carried out and an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was computed to identify factors associated with depression. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant and the strength of the association was presented by an odds ratio of 95% CI. RESULTS: The finding of the present study on the prevalence of depression among quarantined individuals was 18.1 with 95% CI (14.8C22.9). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed and factors such as being female, duration of quarantine, unemployment, and having perceived stigma were significantly associated with depression. RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION: The prevalence of depression symptoms among quarantined individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic was 18.1%. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, being female, duration of quarantine, unemployment, and having perceived stigma were significantly associated with depression. So, clinicians, mental health professionals, and policymakers should work together to address the problem.","output":"Prevalence of Depression and Associated Factors Among Quarantined Individuals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Tigrai Treatment and Quarantine Centers, Tigrai, Ethiopia, 2020: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is highly contagious with limited treatment options. Early and accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 is crucial in reducing the spread of the disease and its accompanied mortality. Currently, detection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard of outpatient and inpatient detection of Covid-19. RT-PCR is a rapid method, however, its accuracy in detection is only ~70-75%. Another approved strategy is computed tomography (CT) imaging. CT imaging has a much higher sensitivity of ~80-98%, but similar accuracy of 70%. To enhance the accuracy of CT imaging detection, we developed an open-source set of algorithms called CovidCTNet that successfully differentiates Covid-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other lung diseases. CovidCTNet increases the accuracy of CT imaging detection to 90% compared to radiologists (70%). The model is designed to work with heterogeneous and small sample sizes independent of the CT imaging hardware. In order to facilitate the detection of Covid-19 globally and assist radiologists and physicians in the screening process, we are releasing all algorithms and parametric details in an open-source format.

Traditional mechanisms of commissioning research are ill-suited to guide policy during a rapidly evolving pandemic. At the same time, contracting with a single centre of expertise has been criticized for failing to reflect challenges inherent in specific modelling approaches. INTERVENTION: This report describes an alternative approach to mobilizing scientific expertise. Ontarios COVID-19 Modelling Consensus Table (MCT) was created in March 2020 to enable rapid communication of credible estimates of the impact of COVID-19 and to accelerate learning on how the disease is spreading and what could slow its transmission. The MCT is a partnership between the province and academic modellers and consists of multiple groups of experts, health system leaders, and senior decision-makers. Armed with Ministry of Health data, the MCT meets once per week to share results from modelling exercises, generate consensus judgements of the likely future impact of COVID-19, and discuss decision-makers priorities. OUTCOMES: The MCT has enabled swift access to data for participants, a structure for developing consensus estimates and communicating these to decision-makers, credible models to inform health system planning, and increased transparency in public reporting of COVID-19 data. It has also facilitated the rapid publication of research findings and its incorporation into government policy. IMPLICATIONS: The MCT approach is one way to quickly draw on scientific advice outside of government and public health agencies. Beyond speed, this approach allows for nimbleness as experts from different organizations can be added as needed.

Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has an affinity to ACE2 receptors which are present in the olfactory epithelium as well as the pulmonary and gastrointestinal (GI) systems. It is stipulated that these receptors are responsible for the entry of the virus into cells explaining the respiratory and GI symptoms of this infection. The anosmia related to COVID-19 is likely due to an aberrant immune response to the virus rather than direct damage to the olfactory epithelium. Similarly, achalasia is also believed to result from an aberrant immune response through which there is degeneration of inhibitory neurons in the myenteric plexus. In this case report, we present the first case of achalasia thought to be linked to a SARS-CoV-2 infection in contemporary literature. AIMS: We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 caused an aberrant immune response in our patient, leading him to develop achalasia. We hope to expose clinicians to this potential complication of COVID-19, allowing them to consider it sooner in their differential. METHODS: The patients file was reviewed to extract the relevant information. A second gastroenterologists opinion was obtained on the manometry to confirm the diagnosis of type III achalasia. RESULTS: A 61-year-old man with a medical history of myasthenia gravis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism, and chronic renal failure was treated in our establishment for a SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. He experienced new severe dysphagic symptoms, regurgitations, and lost 10 pounds during his hospitalization. He also developed anosmia and diarrhea. A CT-scan of his neck and thorax showed no extrinsic compression of his esophagus. No neoplasm was found on his gastroscopy. A barium study was then conducted showing a stagnation of contrast in the distal third of his esophagus. No relaxation of the inferior gastroesophageal sphincter was noted. A manometry was then performed and confirmed a type III achalasia. The mean lower esophageal sphincter residual pressure was elevated at 43.7 mmHg. A calculated 69% of wet swallows were premature contractions with a distal latency value less than 4.5 seconds. The mean distal contractile integral was 13613 mmHg. This corroborates the spastic nature of type III achalasia. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that our patient developed anosmia and knowing its pathogenesis in the context of COVID-19, an inappropriate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 could have equally taken place in the esophagus. This inflammatory response might have caused the degeneration of the inhibitory neurons in the myenteric plexus responsible for the achalasia. Furthermore, given the fact that our patient had diarrhea, this suggests that the virus has a GI tropism supporting our hypothesis. We therefore believe that achalasia may be a potential complication of COVID-19. [Image: see text] High resolution esophageal motility study showing a type III achalasia pattern.

We aimed to characterize the medium and long-term clinical, virological, and serological outcomes after hospitalization for COVID-19, and to identify predictors of long-COVID. METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal study conducted in COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR. Serial blood and nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) were obtained for measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG antibodies during hospital stay, and at 1, 2, and 6 months post-discharge. Genome sequencing was performed where appropriate. Patients filled out a COVID-19 symptom questionnaire (CSQ) at 2-month and 6-month visits, and those with highest scores were characterized. RESULTS: Of 146 patients (60% male, median age 64 years) followed-up, 20.6% required hospital readmission and 5.5% died. At 2 months and 6 months, 9.6% and 7.8% patients, respectively, reported moderate/severe persistent symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive in NPS in 11.8% (median Ct = 38) and 3% (median Ct = 36) patients at 2 months and 6 months, respectively, but no reinfections were demonstrated. Antibody titers gradually waned, with seroreversion occurring at 6 months in 27 (27.6%) patients for N-IgG and in 6 (6%) for S-IgG. Adjusted 2-month predictors of the highest CSQ scores (OR [95%CI]) were lower peak S-IgG (0.80 [0.66C0.94]) and higher WHO severity score (2.57 [1.20C5.86]); 6-month predictors were lower peak S-IgG (0.89 [0.79C0.99]) and female sex (2.41 [1.20C4.82]); no association was found with prolonged viral RNA shedding.

Pharyngeal Electrical Stimulation (PES) is a simple and safe treatment for neurogenic dysphagia. Previously it has been shown that PES can restore safe swallowing in orally intubated or tracheotomised ICU-patients with neurogenic dysphagia following severe stroke. We report the case of a patient with severe neurogenic post-extubation dysphagia (PED) due to prolonged intubation and severe general muscle weakness related to COVID-19, which was successfully treated using PES. Case Presentation A 71-year-old female patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection developed neurogenic dysphagia following prolonged intubation in the ICU. To avoid aerosol generating procedures, her swallowing function was evaluated non-instrumentally as recommended by recently published international guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her swallowing function was markedly impaired and PES therapy was recommended. PES led to a rapid improvement of the post-extubation dysphagia (PED), as evaluated by bedside swallowing assessments using the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS), Dysphagia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS) and diet screening using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). The improved swallowing, as reflected by these measures, allowed this patient to transfer from the ICU to a non-intensive medical department five days after completing PES treatment. Conclusions: PES treatment contributed to the restoration of a safe swallowing function in this critically ill patient with COVID-19 and ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Early clinical bedside swallowing assessment and dysphagia intervention in COVID-19 patients is crucial to optimise their full recovery. Pharyngeal Electrical Stimulation may contribute to a safe and earlier ICU discharge of patients with ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Earlier ICU discharge and reduced rates of re-intubation following PES can help alleviate some of the pressure on ICU bed capacity, which is critical in times of a health emergency such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Successful treatment of intubation-induced severe neurogenic post-extubation dysphagia using Pharyngeal Electrical Stimulation in a COVID-19 survivor: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present article is about the academic partnership between the University of Campinas (Campinas, Brazil) and the Lusfona University (Lisbon, Portugal) for the adoption of a distance-learning methodology to students in the first year of Architecture and Urbanism at UNICAMP during COVID-19 lockdown The contents from the online course Drawing for Graphic Diary were made available to UNICAMP students with minor adaptions Three didactic practices were implemented to face the pandemic restrictions: 1) biweekly tasks to be done in the LusofonaX C Digital Academy LMS environment;2) online advice to students to resolve doubts;3) online synchronous classes with course teachers detailing the exercises and visual expressive modalities The course design assessment was done through questionnaires that were carried out to students using Google Forms at two different moments: 1) before the course, to identify pre-existing skills and available knowledge about drawing concepts For this, the authors depart from the following eight concepts as indicators of pre-existing competences for drawing: conic projection, two-dimensionality, surface, three-dimensionality, vanishing point, perspective construction, visual field and visual expression After the course (2), to assess the perceived evolution of these same concepts through self-reported measures about the perceived knowledge acquired by students Final student evaluation for the course was accessed with the Net Promoter Score (NPS) Results from the t-Tests and the NPS point to the success of the course methodology to deliver distance learning in the subject of design teaching compared to regular classes ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Design Teaching and Learning in Covid-19 Times: An International Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the 10 months since the first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States on January 20, 2020 (1), approximately 13.8 million cases and 272,525 deaths have been reported in the United States.

These strategies include 1) universal face mask use, 2) maintaining physical distance from other persons and limiting in-person contacts, 3) avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, 4) increasing testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, 5) promptly identifying, quarantining, and testing close contacts of persons with known COVID-19, 6) safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 7) protecting essential workers with provision of adequate personal protective equipment and safe work practices, 8) postponing travel, 9) increasing room air ventilation and enhancing hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, and 10) achieving widespread availability and high community coverage with effective COVID-19 vaccines. In combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic's economic impact. Consistent implementation of these strategies improves health equity, preserves health care capacity, maintains the function of essential businesses, and supports the availability of in-person instruction for kindergarten through grade 12 schools and preschool. Individual persons, households, and communities should take these actions now to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its current high level. These actions will provide a bridge to a future with wide availability and high community coverage of effective vaccines, when safe return to more everyday activities in a range of settings will be possible.","output":"Summary of Guidance for Public Health Strategies to Address High Levels of Community Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and Related Deaths, December 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Clinical application of biomarker candidates discovered by proteomic analysis is challenging. The purpose of this study was to standardize preanalytical conditions for measurement of serum levels of fibrinogen alpha C-chain 5.9 kDa fragment (FIC 5.9) and to test the diagnostic value of this peptide for detection of early hepatic fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic hepatitis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Serum FIC 5.9 levels were measured by a sandwich ELISA. Effects on the serum FIC 5.9 level of temperature, the time between venipuncture and serum separation, and the types of collection tubes used were examined. The diagnostic value of serum FIC 5.9 as an early indicator of hepatic fibrosis due to HCV was then assessed. RESULTS FIC 5.9 was produced in a time- and temperature-dependent manner after venipuncture. Abnormal FIC 5.9 values were found in 89.5% of FI stage patients. Receiver operating characteristic analyses confirmed the superiority of FIC 5.9 over other conventional markers for early detection of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The serum FIC 5.9 level may be an early indicator of hepatic fibrosis in HCV-related chronic liver diseases. This study provides an example of a pipeline from biomarker discovery by proteome analysis to assay optimization and preliminary clinical validation.","output":"Serum fibrinogen alpha C-chain 5.9 kDa fragment as a biomarker for early detection of hepatic fibrosis related to hepatitis C virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate care difficulties experienced by caregivers of people with schizophrenia during COVID\\\\19 pandemic lockdowns in Japan (April 7\\\\May 25, 2020) and examine associations between these care difficulties during lockdowns and daily caregiver burden.

Within 3 weeks after mild respiratory symptoms were noted in the index patient, 15 other persons were likely infected with SARS-CoV-2, including three who died. These data illustrate the importance of social distancing for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, even within families. In this cluster, extended family gatherings (a birthday party, funeral, and church attendance), all of which occurred before major social distancing policies were implemented, might have facilitated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 beyond household contacts into the broader community.

Since the role of HPV was demonstrated, few studies have focused on HPV-negative OPSCC. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of therapeutic strategy (surgical vs. non-surgical) on oncologic outcomes in patients with HPV-negative OPSCC. MATERIAL AND METHOD: All p16-negative OPSCCs treated from 2009 to 2014 in 7 tertiary-care centers were included in this retrospective study and were classified according to the therapeutic strategy: surgical strategy (surgery  adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy) vs. non-surgical strategy (definitive radiotherapy  chemotherapy). Patients not eligible for surgery (unresectable tumor, poor general-health status) were excluded. Univariate, multivariate and propensity score matching analyses were performed to compare overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-four (474) patients were included in the study (surgical group: 196; non-surgical group: 278). Five-year OS, DSS and RFS were 76.5, 81.3 and 61.3%, respectively, in the surgical group and 49.9, 61.8 and 43.4%, respectively, in the non-surgical group. The favorable impact of primary surgical treatment on oncologic outcomes was statistically significant after multivariate analysis. This effect was more marked for locally-advanced than for early-stage tumors. Propensity score matching analysis confirmed the prognostic impact of primary surgical treatment for RFS. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic strategy is an independent prognostic factor in patients with p16-negative OPSCC and primary surgical treatment is associated with improved OS, DSS and RFS.

Morbidity and mortality caused by this virus are alarming for the possible increased threat to human health. A Suitable diagnostic test is the prerequisite for designing and developing control measures. But, the tests being employed at present possess one or the other drawback for this disease diagnosis. During the dengue virus infections, NS2B is essential for the stability and catalytic activity of the NS3 protease. N-terminal 185 amino acids of NS3 protease domain along with hydrophilic portion of NS2B (NS2BNS3pro) is being used to screen dengue inhibitors but not for diagnosis until now. In the present study, we have used purified NS2BNS3pro as an antigen to trap anti-NS2BNS3pro antibodies of the clinical samples. Antibodies were detected successfully in both western blotting and ELISA tests. In ELISA, antibodies were detected in both primary and secondary infections of all serotypes. Interestingly, 17 samples declared as other febrile infections by NS1 and IgM/IgG tests were found to be positive in present test, which were further confirmed by RT-PCR. In silico studies suggested the absence of conserved epitopes between NS2BNS3pro and the counterpart in JEV, Zika, and CHIKV, indicating less possibility of crossreaction, which was in turn confirmed by using synthetic peptides representing the above epitopes.

Methods: Autoimmune rheumatic disease (AIRD) patients treated with rituximab who had completed two doses of COVID-19 vaccination were enrolled. Peripheral B-cell counts were estimated along with the titer of immunoglobulin G antibody-directed against the receptor-binding domain of spike1 protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Antibody titers of participants were compared against B-cell re-population. Results: Out of the 33 participants with available prevaccination B-cell counts, 11 did not have any detectable peripheral B cells before vaccination, and out of these patients, only 1 developed antibodies postvaccination, whereas, of the remaining 22, 18 (81.8%) had a positive seroconversion. Although all patients who had received the last dose of Rituximab at least 1 year before vaccination had antibodies, there was no direct correlation between time from the last dose and antibody positivity. B-cell re-population was strongly associated with seroconversion (P = 0.0001).

DESIGN: Retrospective review of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation data collected from routine clinical care. SETTING: Forty-three hospitals contributing coronavirus disease 2019 patient data between March 14, and June 17, 2020, and 132 hospitals in the United States contributing data on viral pneumonia patients to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation database between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: One thousand four hundred ninety-one patients with diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and 4,200 patients with a primary (n = 2,544) or secondary (n = 1,656) admitting diagnosis of noncoronavirus disease viral pneumonia receiving ICU care. A subset of 202 viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome was examined separately. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN RESULTS: Mean age was 63.4 for coronavirus disease (p = 0.064) versus 64.1 for viral pneumonia. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV scores were similar at 56.7 and 55.0, respectively (p = 0.060), but gender and ethnic distributions differed, as did PaO2 to FIO2 ratio and WBC count at admission. The hospital standardized mortality ratio (95% CI) was 1.52 (1.35-1.68) for coronavirus disease patients and 0.82 (0.75-0.90) for viral pneumonia patients. In the coronavirus disease group, ICU and hospital length of stay were 3.1 and 3.0 days longer than in viral pneumonia patients. Standardized ICU and hospital length of stay ratios were 1.13 and 1.46 in the coronavirus disease group versus 0.95 and 0.94 in viral pneumonia patients. Forty-seven percent of coronavirus disease patients received invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support on their first ICU day versus 65% with viral pneumonia.

DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional study, we recruited English-language migrants (n = 411) living in Israel to respond to an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 3 April to 16 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The dependent variable comprised the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores, which attained an internal consistency of 0.91 in this sample. RESULTS: PSS scores were related to lower age (p < 0.0001), being single (p = 0.0095), not possessing high (p = 0.0069) or medium resilience (p = 0.0002), reporting below average SES (p = 0.0196), being \\"extremely\\" worried about getting COVID-19 (p < 0.0001), and having high health literacy (p = 0.0007). Additionally, the interaction between health literacy and resilience (p < 0.0001) showed that migrants with high resilience and high health literacy had the lowest perceived stress; and migrants with low resilience and high health literacy had the highest perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions are needed to assist migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal intervention will aim to address the psychological distress while increasing both health literacy and resilience.","output":"Health literacy, resilience and perceived stress of migrants in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is an unprecedented Bill to deal with an unprecedented crisis.

More than a year since WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic, information on the lasting effects of this infection on the cardiovascular system beyond the acute phase is still lacking. PURPOSE: To study macrovascular endothelial dysfunction and activation, coagulation and inflammation, 3 months after resolution of acute COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational cohort study was conducted including 203 patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease, 6C20 weeks after acute COVID-19. The primary endpoint was macrovascular endothelial function, assessed by the carotid artery reactivity (CAR) test. The CAR measures the carotid artery diameter in response to hand in ice-water immersion. A historic cohort of 313 subjects served as controls. Propensity score matching was used to correct for baseline differences. Plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1), interleukin (IL)-1ra, IL-6, IL-18 were measured by ELISA. ET-1 levels were also measured in a partially overlapping COVID-19 cohort of which plasma samples were available during the acute phase. Coagulation enzyme:inhibitor complexes for thrombin:antithrombin (TAT), factor (F) IXa:AT, FVIIa:AT, FXIa:AT, FXIa:alpha 1 antitrypsin (a1AT), FXIa:C1 esterase inhibitor (C1inh), kallikrein(PKa):C1inh and von Willebrand Factor:antigen (vWF:Ag), were assessed by in house developed ELISA. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the prevalence of macrovascular dysfunction did not differ between the COVID-19 (22.5%) versus the historical control cohort (18.6%, RD ?3.92%, 95%-CI ?15 to 7.19, p=0.49). Plasma concentrations of markers for endothelial activation were elevated (>1 SD above normal); ET-1 (64.9%), and vWF:Ag (80.8%). In controls, ET-1 levels were significantly lower as compared to COVID-19 patients during the acute phase and after 3 months. ET-1 levels were significantly higher 3 months after COVID-19 as compared to the acute phase. Cytokines were high in a majority of patients: IL-18 (73.9%), IL-6 (51.2%), and IL-1ra (48.9%). TAT and FIXa:AT, reflecting a prothrombotic state, were high in 48.3% and 29.6% of the patients, respectively. FVIIa:AT, as marker of the extrinsic pathway, was elevated (35%). Markers of contact activation were also increased: PKa:C1inh (16.3%), FXIa:AT (16.3%), FXIa:a1AT (20.7%), and FXIa:C1inh (17.7%) (picture 1). CONCLUSIONS: At 3 months after acute COVID-19 there was no indication of macrovascular dysfunction as compared to matched historic controls; there was evidence, however, of sustained thrombo-inflammation, indicated by high circulating concentrations of ET-1, vWF:Ag, proinflammatory cytokines, and markers of coagulation (picture 2). Elevated IL-18 levels could potentially induce arterial inflammation and subsequent atherogenesis. Our data highlight the importance of further studies on SARS-CoV-2 related thrombo-inflammation, as well as longer follow-ups in recovered patients.

The reconstituted, Zn(2+)-containing PL1pro was not sensitive to 1,10-phenanthroline, and the Zn(2+)-depleted protein was not reactivated by adding Zn(2+) after renaturation. Consistent with the proposed essential structural role of Zn(2+), PL1pro was selectively inactivated by mutations in the Zn(2+) finger, including replacements of any of four conserved Cys residues predicted to co-ordinate Zn(2+).

A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out to compare the environmental impact of the UK population practising increased levels of hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic for 1 year. Washing hands with soap and water was compared to using hand sanitizer (both ethanol and isopropanol based sanitizers were studied). The isopropanol-based HS had the lowest environmental impact in 14 out of the 16 impact categories used in this study. For climate change, hand hygiene using isopropanol HS produced the equivalent of 1060 million kg CO(2), compared to 1460 million for ethanol HS, 2300 million for bar soap HW, and 4240 million for liquid soap HW. For both the ethanol and isopropanol HS, the active ingredient was the greatest overall contributing factor to the environmental impact (83.24% and 68.68% respectively). For HW with liquid soap and bar soap, there were additional contributing factors other than the soap itself: for example tap water use (28.12% and 48.68% respectively) and the laundering of a hand towel to dry the hands (10.17% and 17.92% respectively). All forms of hand hygiene have an environmental cost, and this needs to be weighed up against the health benefits of preventing disease transmission. When comparing hand sanitizers to handwashing with soap and water, this study found that using isopropanol based hand sanitizer is better for planetary health. However, no method of hand hygiene was ideal; isopropanol had a greater fossil fuel resource use than ethanol based hand sanitizer. More research is needed to find hand hygiene sources which do not diminish planetary health, and environmental impact is a consideration for public health campaigns around hand hygiene.

Review articles, clinical trials, and drug monographs were reviewed. Study selection and data extraction: Relevant English-language monographs and studies conducted in humans were considered. Data synthesis: Opicapone was FDA approved for the treatment of end-of-motor motor fluctuation in adults with Parkinsons disease in April 2020 based on two published randomized clinical trials that were 14 to 15 weeks in duration called BIPARK I and BIPARK II. Based on the clinical trials, 50 mg of opicapone once daily was shown to be noninferior to entacapone and reduced the mean off time by about 50 min when compared to placebo. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events were dyskinesia, falls, insomnia, and elevated blood creatine phosphokinase levels. Relevance to patient care and clinical practice: Opicapone overcomes the limitations associated with other COMT inhibitors since it is dosed once daily, well tolerated, and has not been associated with the risk of hepatic failure. When switching from entacapone to opicapone a reduction in off time of ?39.3 min was also seen.

COPD is associated with increased airway epithelial expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell surface receptor to which the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein binds and which mediates entry of the virus into cells. Hypercapnia, the elevation of CO2 in blood and tissue, commonly develops in advanced COPD and is associated with frequent and potentially fatal pulmonary infections. We previously showed that normoxic hypercapnia alters expression of innate immune genes, including multiple viral response genes, in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells (Sci Reports 8:13508, 2018). Thus, in the current study, we explored the effect of hypercapnia on expression of ACE2 and uptake of a Pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 baculovirus by airway epithelial cells. Methods: HBE cells (Lonza) differentiated at air-liquid interface or immortalized BEAS-2B cells were pre-incubated in normocapnia (NC, 5% CO2, PCO2 36 mmHg) or normoxic hypercapnia (HC, 15% CO2, PCO2 108 mmHg) for 4 days. ACE2 protein expression was assessed by immunoblot or immunofluorescence (IF). In addition, BEAS-2B cells pre-exposed to NC or HC for 2 days were infected with Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 for an additional 2 days. Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 (Montana Molecular) is a reporter baculovirus whose surface is decorated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and which induces expression of Neon Green protein in the nucleus of host cells 24 h after viral entry. For in vivo studies, C57BL/6 mice were pre-exposed to normoxic hypercapnia (10% CO2/21% O2) for 7 days, or air as control, and ACE2 expression in lung tissue was assessed by IF. Results: Compared to culture in NC, HC increased ACE2 protein expression by 4-fold in HBE cells and 2.5-fold in BEAS-2B cells. Likewise exposure of mice for 7 days to 10% CO2, as compared to air, markedly increased airway epithelial cell expression of ACE2 (Figure 1). Additionally, culture in HC, as compared to NC, increased Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 entry to BEAS-2B cells. Conclusion: Elevated CO2 increases airway epithelial cell expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, in vitro and in vivo. This may lead to a greater burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with hypercapnia, and in part account for worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in advanced COPD and other severe lung diseases.","output":"Hypercapnia Increases ACE2 Protein Expression and Pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 Virus Entry in Airway Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last two decades, a large number of new viruses have been discovered, many of which are pathogenic in humans or other vertebrates.

Here we show that helminth infection in mice elicits IL-10 expression in both the intestinal lamina propria and the draining mesenteric lymph node, with higher expression in the infected tissue. In vitro, exogenous IL-10 enhanced Th2 differentiation in isolated CD4+ T cells, increasing expression of GATA3 and production of IL-5 and IL-13. The ability of IL-10 to amplify the Th2 response coincided with its suppression of IFN?3 expression and in vivo we found that, in intestinal helminth infection, IL-10 receptor expression was higher on Th1 cells in the small intestine than on Th2 cells in the same tissue, or on any Th cell in the draining lymph node. In vivo blockade of IL-10 signalling during helminth infection resulted in an expansion of IFN?3+ and Tbet+ Th1 cells in the small intestine and a coincident decrease in IL-13, IL-5 and GATA3 expression by intestinal T cells. These changes in Th2 cytokines correlated with reduced expression of type 2 effector molecules, such as RELM, and increased parasite egg production.

From the Bahamas to Brazil, from Mexico and Central America to the Lesser Antilles, coastal and maritime communities have been impacted by hurricanes, storm surges, earthquakes, sargassum and oil spills along with other climate, weather and human induced events. In addition to the coastal impacts, ocean hazards also have affected the safe and timely delivery of goods and services in a region that is extremely dependent on maritime transport. COVID-19 has compounded even more the situation of millions of people in the region and put extreme pressure on government officials, including disaster management and health professionals as well as the maritime industry. Climate change will only exacerbate the situation. The UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) presents itself as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stop the cycle of disasters with A Safe Ocean as one of its seven major societal outcomes. The Western Tropical Atlantic Safe Ocean Working Group was established to co-design and co-deliver with local, national and regional partners transformative strategies that will facilitate and inspire actions to reduce and mitigate the ocean related threats while creating resilient and safer coastal communities and maritime activities. At the core is an Integrated Multi Hazard Ocean Data and Forecast System. Its services would be linked to education, outreach, readiness and communication that empowers and recognizes national and local policy decisions and includes individual response for the protection of life and livelihoods.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs) registered in our rheumatology clinic were assessed during their routine outpatient follow-up control or contacted via phone between July and December 2020. Patients' demographics, diagnosis, medication, comorbidities, frequency of going outside during the pandemic, work status, whether patients could attend their routine follow-up, treatment changes, access to drugs during the pandemic, and the incidence of Covid-19 infection were collected. RESULTS: A total of 320 patients with IRD were analysed; 114 (35.6%) patients were treated with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) (methotrexate/leflunomide/sulfasalazine), 93 (29.1%) patients with biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), 113 (35.3%) patients with glucocorticoids, and 103 (32.2%) patients with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). A total of 15.9% of patients on HCQ experienced problems in medication supply. Only 87 (27.2%) patients presented for their routine follow-up appointment, and 38 (11.9%) of the patients changed their treatment without professional health advice. While 53 (57%) patients on biological agents continued their treatment, 31 patients (33.3%) interrupted the treatment with doctor's recommendation and 9 patients (9.6%) on their initiative, and 23 of these 31 patients had to restart treatment because of disease activation. The nasopharyngeal swab collected from 30 patients with a suspected Covid-19 contact but without any symptoms was negative. In total, there were 33 patients diagnosed with Covid-19; none of whom had severe respiratory complications or death. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with rheumatic diseases are left without disease monitoring during the pandemic.

It was first isolated in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and after that, MERS-CoV exhibited outbreaks in several regions of the world. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of publications involving MERS-CoV at global level by using a bibliometric analysis. METHODS: Scopus database was searched on March 4, 2016 for MERS-CoV publications published between 2012 and 2015. It was performed on the same day in order to avoid the possible bias came from update on the database because the metrics are changing over time. All publication types were considered; however publications as errata were excluded. Analysis parameters include year of publication, publication type, patterns of international collaboration, research institutions, journals, impact factor, h-index, language, and times cited. RESULTS: A total of 883 MERS-CoV research publications were published across the world. The MERS-CoV-associated publications were originated from 92 countries/territories, indicating the international spread of MERS-CoV research. The USA was the largest contributor, with 319 articles published over 4 years, followed by KSA (113 articles). The total number of citations for these publications has already achieved 8,015, with an average of 9.01 citations per each publication. The h-index for MERS-CoV-associated publications was 48. The USA also have the highest h-index (32), followed by KSA (26) and UK (22). Netherland produced the greatest proportion of publications with international research collaboration (72.7 %) followed by the UK (71 %) and Germany (69.1 %) out of the total number of publications for each country. CONCLUSIONS: There is a rapid increase in research activities related to MERS-CoV from 2012 to 2015. This study demonstrates that the MERS-CoV related literature has grown to be more extensive and global over the past 4 years. The bulk of publications in the field of MERS-CoV research are published by high-income countries such as the USA.

This analysis shows that the State seeks to centralise, marginalising both the Regions and the Conference State-Regions, the latter being deprived of its key role in health governance before pandemic. The process of centralisation is strengthened by the Constitutional Court: the sentence n. 37 of 2021 extends the boundaries of the State exclusive legislative competence, according to article 117, second paragraph of the Constitution.

The dynamics of the model are influenced by the number of asymptomatic cases, hospitalization requirements and mortality due to the disease. A locally-informed model was determined using actual hospitalization records. Together with cases and casualty data, optimized estimates for model parameters were obtained within a metaheuristic framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization. Our strategy is supported by a statistical sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, adequate to properly account for the simulated scenarios. First, we evaluated the effect of previously enforced interventions on the transmission rate. Then, we studied its effects on the number of deaths as well as hospitalization requirements, considering the state as a whole. Special attention is given to the impact of asymptomatic individuals on the dynamic of COVID-19 transmission, as these were estimated to contribute to a 68% increase in the basic reproductive number. Finally, we delineated scenarios that can set guides to protect the health care system, particularly by keeping demand below total bed occupancy. Our results underscore the challenges related to maintaining a fully capable health infrastructure during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, specially in a low-resource setting such as the one focused in this work. The evidences produced by our modelling-based analysis show that decreasing the transmission rate is paramount to success in maintaining health resources availability, but that current local efforts, leading to a 38% decrease in the transmission rate, are still insufficient to prevent its collapse at peak demand. Carefully planned and timely applied interventions, that result in stark decreases in transmission rate, were found to be the most effective in preventing hospital bed shortages for the longest periods.","output":"Evaluating the burden of COVID-19 on hospital resources in Bahia, Brazil: A modelling-based analysis of 14.8 million individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus had been in existence for many years, but its effects has not been so evident as the whole world experienced recently.

Methods A comprehensive literature search of different electronic databases was conducted for systematic reviews investigating different anchorage methods published up to April 15, 2021. Any ongoing systematic reviews were searched using PROSPERO, and a grey literature search was undertaken using Google Scholar and OpenGrey. No language restriction was applied. Screening, quality assessment, and data extraction were performed independently by two authors. Information was categorized and narratively synthesized for the key findings from moderate- and high-quality reviews. Results Fourteen systematic reviews were included (11 were of moderate/high quality). Skeletal anchorage with miniscrews was associated with less anchorage loss (and sometimes with anchorage gain). Similarly, skeletal anchorage was more effective in retracting anterior teeth and intruding incisors and molars, resulting in minor vertical skeletal changes and improvements in the soft tissue profile. However, insufficient evidence was obtained for the preference of any anchorage method in terms of the duration of treatment, number of appointments, quality of treatment, patient perception, or adverse effects. The effectiveness of skeletal anchorage can be enhanced when: directly loaded, used in the mandible rather than the maxilla, used buccally rather than palatally, using dual rather than single miniscrews, used for en-masse retraction, and in adults. Conclusions The level of evidence regarding anchorage effectiveness is moderate. Nevertheless, compared to conventional anchorage, skeletal anchorage can be used with more anchorage preservation.

Vacuolar cation/H+ exchangers (CAXs) have long been recognized as 'housekeeping' components in cellular Ca2+ and trace metal homeostasis, being involved in a range of key cellular and physiological processes. However, the mechanisms that drive functional activation of the transporters are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the function of a putative grapevine CAX-interacting protein, VvCXIP4, by testing its ability to activate VvCAX3, previously characterized as a tonoplast-localized Ca2+/H+ exchanger. VvCAX3 contains an autoinhibitory domain that drives inactivation of the transporter and thus, is incapable of suppressing the Ca2+-hypersensitive phenotype of the S. cerevisiae mutant K667. In this study, the co-expression of VvCXIP4 and VvCAX3 in this strain efficiently rescued its growth defect at high Ca2+ levels. Flow cytometry experiments showed that yeast harboring both proteins effectively accumulated higher Ca2+ levels than cells expressing each of the proteins separately. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays allowed visualization of the direct interaction between the proteins in tobacco plants and in yeast, and also showed the self-interaction of VvCAX3 but not of VvCXIP4. Subcellular localization studies showed that, despite being primarily localized to the nucleus, VvCXIP4 is able to move to other cell compartments upon a Ca2+ stimulus, becoming prone to interaction with the tonoplast-localized VvCAX3. qPCR analysis showed that both genes are more expressed in grapevine stems and leaves, followed by the roots, and that the steady-state transcript levels were higher in the pulp than in the skin of grape berries. Also, both VvCXIP4 and VvCAX3 were upregulated by Ca2+ and Na+, indicating they share common regulatory mechanisms. However, VvCXIP4 was also upregulated by Li+, Cu2+ and Mn2+, and its expression increased steadily throughout grape berry development, contrary to VvCAX3, suggesting additional physiological roles for VvCXIP4, including the regulation of VvCAXs not yet functionally characterized. The main novelty of the present study was the demonstration of physical interaction between CXIP and CAX proteins from a woody plant model by BiFC assays, demonstrating the intracellular mobilization of CXIPs in response to Ca2+.","output":"The grapevine CAX-interacting protein VvCXIP4 is exported from the nucleus to activate the tonoplast Ca2+/H+ exchanger VvCAX3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we investigate the problem of synthesizing computable functions of infinite words over an infinite alphabet (data [Formula: see text] -words).

About four-fifth of COVID-19 infections remain asymptomatic. With an incu- bation period of 7-14 days, patients can also remain in the pre-symptomatic stage. Hence, knowledge of the prevalence of disease among the asymptomatic is important to prevent spread of disease to the health care professional as well as for patient safety.

Methods:A retrospective study of all asymptomatic pre-procedural cases was conducted from 10th June 2020 till 10th November 2020. Nasal swabs were collected from patients 48 hours before procedures (including elective and emer- gency surgeries, patient scheduled to receive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, patients undergoing biopsy, endoscopy).

However, the pathogenesis of dengue has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we employed bioinformatics analysis to identify potential biomarkers related to dengue fever and clarify their underlying mechanisms. The results showed that there were 668, 1901, and 8283 differentially expressed genes between the dengue-infected samples and normal samples in the GSE28405, GSE38246, and GSE51808 datasets, respectively. Through overlapping, a total of 69 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 51 were upregulated and 18 were downregulated. We identified twelve hub genes, including MX1, IFI44L, IFI44, IFI27, ISG15, STAT1, IFI35, OAS3, OAS2, OAS1, IFI6, and USP18. Except for IFI44 and STAT1, the others were statistically significant after validation. We predicted the related microRNAs (miRNAs) of these 12 target genes through the database miRTarBase, and finally obtained one important miRNA: has-mir-146a-5p. In addition, gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were carried out, and a proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to gain insight into the actions of DEGs. In conclusion, our study displayed the effectiveness of bioinformatics analysis methods in screening potential pathogenic genes in dengue fever and their underlying mechanisms. Further, we successfully predicted IFI44L and IFI6, as potential biomarkers with DENV infection, providing promising targets for the treatment of dengue fever to a certain extent.","output":"Identification of potential biomarkers in dengue via integrated bioinformatic analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 physical distancing measures can potentially increase the likelihood of mental disorders. It is unknown whether these measures are associated with depression and anxiety. OBJECTIVES: To investigate meta-analytic global levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and how the implementation of mitigation strategies (i.e. public transportation closures, stay-at-home orders, etc.) impacted such disorders. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Current Content Connect, PsycINFO, CINAHL, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv databases for depression and anxiety prevalences; Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker for the containment and closure policies indexes; Global Burden of Disease Study for previous levels of depression and anxiety. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original studies conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, which assessed categorical depression and anxiety, using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales (cutoff ?10). PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: General population, healthcare providers, students, and patients. National physical distancing measures. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Meta-analysis and meta-regression. RESULTS: In total, 226 638 individuals were assessed within the 60 included studies. Global prevalence of both depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.0% and 21.3%, respectively. There were differences in the prevalence of both anxiety and depression reported across regions and countries. Asia (17.6% and 17.9%), and China (16.2% and 15.5%) especially, had the lowest prevalence of both disorders. Regarding the impact of mitigation strategies on mental health, only public transportation closures increased the prevalence of anxiety, especially in Europe. LIMITATIONS: Country-level data on physical distancing measures and previous anxiety/depression may not necessarily reflect local (i.e. city-specific) contexts. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Mental health concerns should not be viewed only as a delayed consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also as a concurrent epidemic. Our data provide support for policy-makers to consider real-time enhanced mental health services, and increase initiatives to foster positive mental health outcomes.","output":"Investigating the effect of national government physical distancing measures on depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic through meta-analysis and meta-regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we propose a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor using silicon nitride (Si(3)N(4)), black phosphorous (BP), and thiol-tethered DNA as a ligand for fast detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

This draws the interest of numerous scholars who have sought to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the energy sector as well as the prospects for a green recovery trajectory. However, few of these authors have considered the role of fiscal stimulus that governments have provided in the context of green recoveries. This study aims to fill that gap, focusing on the case of ASEAN member states (AMS). For this purpose, we employ both statistical data from official sources and qualitative evidence collected through interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with officials from ASEAN countries. This study finds that green recovery stimulus in AMS is still limited. Although some of the fiscal supports that ASEAN countries have launched have had indirect effects on energy, policy makers in the region have not prioritized the green recovery at the center of recovery path. A major factor is fiscal limitations that force the governments of ASEAN countries to focus on strengthening the health sector and supporting vulnerable groups. Accordingly, this analysis highlights the importance of exploring other funding opportunities, including grants and concessional financing, to support green recovery in the region. ?

However, two of those studies provided convalescent plasma therapy on average 8 days after diagnosis despite earlier data proving that the therapy is most effective when given within 3 days of diagnosis. Another more recent randomized controlled trial found evidence in support of convalescent plasma therapy and we believe that it is no coincidence that they administered convalescent plasma therapy within 3 days of symptom onset. We call for more robustly planned randomized controlled studies to further reliably determine the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy against SARS-CoV-2. Progress has been made with developing a vaccine but there is likely to be a substantial lag in widespread administration of the vaccine, especially in poorer countries.

Here, we report a DNA vaccine containing the spike gene for delivery via electroporation. The spike genes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were codon optimized for mammalian cell expression and then cloned into mammalian cell expression vectors, called pSARS-S and pSARS2-S, respectively. Spike protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting after transient expression in HEK293T cells. After immunization, sera were collected for antigen-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titer analyses. We found that both pSARS-S and pSARS2-S immunization induced similar levels of antibodies against S2 of SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, only pSARS2-S immunization induced antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. We further found that pSARS2-S immunization, but not pSARS-S immunization, could induce very high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We further analyzed SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific T cell responses and found that the immune responses were biased toward Th1. Importantly, pSARS2-S immunization in hamsters could induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo.

There are, however, many controversies regarding indications for initiating ECMO in this setting and the appropriate management strategies thereafter. Broad indications for ECMO include hypoxia, hypercarbia, and severe air leak syndrome, with hypoxia being the most common. There are many disease-specific considerations when evaluating children for ECMO, but there are currently very few, if any, absolute contraindications. Venovenous rather than veno-arterial ECMO cannulation is the preferred configuration for ECMO support of acute respiratory failure due to its superior side-effect profile. The approach to lung management on ECMO is variable and should be individualized to the patient, with the main goal of reducing the risk of VILI. ECMO is a relatively rare intervention, and there are likely a minimum number of cases per year at a given center to maintain competency.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Epidemiological data on all reported cases of rubella and CRS were obtained from the Communicable Diseases Division and Central Claims Processing System, respectively, at the Ministry of Health. Coverage of the childhood immunisation programme against rubella was based on the immunisation data maintained by the National Immunisation Registry, Health Promotion Board. To assess the herd immunity of the population against rubella, 4 serological surveys were conducted from 1989 to 1990, in 1993, 1998 and 2004. RESULTS The incidence of rubella has decreased significantly from the peak of 13.3 per 100,000 population in 1996 to 1.8 per 100,000 in 2007. CRS has virtually disappeared. With more than 92% to 93% of primary school leavers and preschool children annually vaccinated against rubella since 1976 and 1990, respectively, the level of susceptibility to rubella among women in the reproductive age group has gradually decreased from 44% in 1975 to 28% in 1985, and maintained at between 10% and 20% from 1987 to 1998.

In our hospital, we have implemented a two-level prescreening process in the outpatient clinic: an initial prescreening process at the entrance of the outpatient clinic (PPEO) and a second prescreening process is repeated in each department. If any symptoms or epidemiological history are identified at the second level, an emergency code is announced through the hospital's address system. The patient is then guided outside through a designated aisle. In this study, we analyze the cases missed in the PPEO that caused the emergency code to be applied. METHODS: All cases reported from March 2020 to April 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. We calculated the incidence of cases missed by the PPEO per 1,000 outpatients and compared the incidence between first-time hospital visitors and those visiting for the second time or more; morning and afternoon office hours; and days of the week. RESULTS: During the study period, the emergency code was applied to 449 cases missed by the PPEO. Among those cases, 20.7% were reported in otorhinolaryngology, followed by 11.6% in gastroenterology, 5.8% in urology, and 5.8% in dermatology. Fever was the most common symptom (59.9%), followed by cough (19.8%).

We previously prepared five MoAb against HAb18G/CD147, named HAb18, 3B3, 1B3, 5A5 and 4D2. To map the epitopes of these MoAb, a series of truncated fragments of extracellular region of HAb18G/CD147 was expressed in Escherichia coli and the MoAb-binding affinity to these fragments was examined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot.

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered spontaneous and intensive media attention, which has affected peoples adoption of personal preventive measures and their mental health. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between exposure to COVID-19Cspecific information and mental health (depression and sleep quality) and self-reported compliance with personal preventive measures (face mask wearing and hand sanitizing). We also tested whether these associations were moderated by thoughtful consideration of the veracity of the information to which people were exposed. METHODS: A cross-sectional, closed web-based survey was conducted among a sample of 3035 factory workers at the beginning of work resumption following the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used for recruitment. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for the analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable moderate-to-severe depression was 170/3035 (5.6%), while that of good or excellent sleep quality was 2110/3035 (69.5%). The prevalence of self-reported consistent face mask wearing in public places was 2903/3035 (95.7%), while that of sanitizing hands every time after returning from public spaces or touching public installations was 2151/3035 (70.9%). Of the 3035 respondents, 1013 to 1638 (33.3% to 54.0%) reported >1 hour of daily exposure to COVID-19Cspecific information through web-based media and television. After controlling for significant background variables, higher information exposure via television and via newspapers and magazines was associated with better sleep quality and higher compliance with hand sanitizing. Higher exposure via unofficial web-based media was associated with higher compliance with hand sanitizing but was also associated with higher depressive symptoms. In contrast, higher exposure through face-to-face communication was associated with higher depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality, and lower compliance with hand sanitizing. Exposure to information about positive outcomes for patients with COVID-19, development of vaccines and effective treatments, and heroic stories about frontline health care workers were associated with both better mental health and higher compliance with preventive measures. Higher overall information exposure was associated with higher depressive symptoms among participants who were less likely to carefully consider the veracity of the information to which they were exposed; it was also associated with better sleep quality among people who reported more thoughtful consideration of information veracity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence of how the amount, sources, and contents of information to which people were exposed influenced their mental health and compliance with personal preventive measures at the initial phase of work resumption in China. Thoughtful consideration of information quality was found to play an important moderating role.

The Prospective Memory Concerns Questionnaire (PMCQ) was designed as a self-report measure to understand individuals concerns about their memory. This questionnaire may help identify issues with PM which in turn may assist clinicians in the targeted implementation of memory compensation strategies. The PMCQ was developed using Rasch and classical test methodologies, with subscales measuring frequency of forgetting behaviors, memory concerns, and retrieval failures. The current study aimed to confirm the factor structure of the PMCQ for use in adults in the general population. The study also aimed to examine relationships between the PMCQ and naturalistic performance-based measures of PM to determine how the self-report PMCQ could be used in conjunction with performance-based measures. A community dwelling sample of 558 adults completed the PMCQ, an event-based naturalistic PM task, and time-based naturalistic PM task. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) indicated that a higher order model with three subscales containing 35 items produced acceptable fit [RMSEA = 0.056 (90% CI 0.054, 0.060), SRMR = 0.062, CFI = 0.915, TLI = 0.909] The PMCQ demonstrated good internal consistency (total  = 0.95, subscales:  = 0.88C0.89). The Forgetting Behaviors subscale significantly correlated with performance on the event-based naturalistic PM task (r = ?0.14, p < 0.01). The Memory Concerns and Retrieval Failures subscales did not correlate significantly with performance-based PM tasks. These findings suggest that the PMCQ may be best suited for assessing individuals concerns about their forgetting behaviors and identifying appropriate compensation strategies or support services. It is recommended that the PMCQ be used alongside performance-based PM tasks and other cognitive measures to comprehensively assess PM. It was concluded that the PMCQ is a suitable measure for use in adults in the general population. Further validation research of the PMCQ in general population and clinical samples will determine the measures sensitivity and specificity in identifying PM impairments.","output":"Validation of the Prospective Memory Concerns Questionnaire (PMCQ)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the characteristics of COVID-19, the epidemic develops rapidly and overwhelms health service systems worldwide. Many patients suffer from systemic life-threatening problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. Thus the intelligent prognosis is in an urgent need to assist physicians to take an early intervention, prevent the adverse outcome, and optimize the medical resource allocation. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic mechanisms, rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based approach, CovidCare, which leverages the existing electronic medical records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical features based on massive existing EMR data via transfer learning. The transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model's representation behavior based on knowledge distillation, which embeds the health status more comprehensively in the source dataset. We conduct the length of stay prediction experiments for patients on a real-world COVID-19 dataset. The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently outperforms the comparative baseline methods. CovidCare also reveals that, 1) hs-cTnI, hs-CRP and Platelet Counts are the most fatal biomarkers, whose abnormal values usually indicate emergency adverse outcome. 2) Normal values of gamma-GT, AP and eGFR indicate the overall improvement of health. The medical findings extracted by CovidCare are empirically confirmed by human experts and medical literatures.","output":"CovidCare: Transferring Knowledge from Existing EMR to Emerging Epidemic for Interpretable Prognosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 epidemic period, people showed a stronger connection to the environment within their communities. Although tree canopy in residential areas has been shown to positively affect psychological distress, it is not clear whether the COVID-19 epidemic played a role in this process. Elucidation of the relationship between tree canopy and the impact on psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic could provide valuable information as to the best methods to help individuals cope with urban mental stress events. METHODS: A total of 15 randomly selected residential areas of Beijing were enrolled in this repeated cross-sectional study. A total of 900 residents were included in the two-waves of the investigation (450 residents per wave) before and during the COVID-19 epidemic (i.e., May 2019 and May 2020). Psychological distress was estimated using the 12-question General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Tree canopy coverage (TCC) was measured through visual interpretation based on the 2013 data sources (World View 2 satellite imagery of Beijing urban areas with a resolution of 0.5 m). The demographic characteristics, distance to the nearest surrounding green or blue space, residential area house price, household density, and construction year were also collected in this study. A multivariate logistic regression, relative risk due to interaction (RERI), and synergy index (SI) were used to explore the relationships among tree canopy, COVID-19, and psychological distress. RESULTS: The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health was significant, with the prevalence of psychological distress increased 7.84 times (aOR = 7.84, 95% CI = 4.67C13.95) during the COVID-19 epidemic period. Tree canopy coverage in the group without psychological distress was significantly higher than that of the psychologically distressed group (31.07  11.38% vs. 27.87  12.97%, P = 0.005). An increase in 1% of TCC, was related to a 5% decrease in the prevalence of psychological distress (aOR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93C0.98). An antagonism joint action between tree canopy and the COVID-19 epidemic existed (RERI = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.72C1.47; SI = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05C0.52), and persisted enhancing only in medium (26.45%C33.21%) and above TCC level. Correlation of GHQ items and TCC significantly differed between the COVID-19 non-epidemic and epidemic periods, with the effects of tree canopy on GHQ-12 items covering topics, such as social function and depression, presumably absent because of epidemic limitations. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the COVID-19 epidemic harmed mental health and verified the positive effects of residential tree canopy on psychological distress in Beijing. We suggest paying more attention to residents in areas of low TCC and dealing with psychological distress caused by public health stress events based on tree canopy strategies.","output":"Effects of tree canopy on psychological distress: A repeated cross-sectional study before and during the COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Over the last months, during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, a growing number of chilblain\\\\like lesions was reported mainly in children, rarely in young adults.

METHODS: prospective study on a case series including children who presented with acral lesions at the Pediatric Dermatology Outpatient and Pediatric Emergency Unit of the University of Bologna, from April 1 to April 30, 2020. We reported demographical, laboratory and clinical features, history of close contact with COVID\\\\19 patients, presence of similar skin lesions in other family members, precipitating and risk factors for chilblain onset. RESULTS: We evaluated 8 patients (5 females, 3 males) aged between 11 and 15 years. We excluded acute or previous SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection with RT\\\\PCR nasopharyngeal swab, serum antibody levels using chemiluminescent immunoassays. Other acute infections causing purpuric lesions at the extremities were negative in all patients.

Using a mathematical simulation of vaccination, we find that factors related to implementation will contribute more to the success of vaccination programs than a vaccine's efficacy as determined in clinical trials. The benefits of a vaccine will decline substantially in the event of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy, or greater epidemic severity. Our findings demonstrate the urgent need for health officials to invest greater financial resources and attention to vaccine production and distribution programs, to redouble efforts to promote public confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, and to encourage continued adherence to other mitigation approaches, even after a vaccine becomes available.

The first and the foremost step towards this process is the recovery of the people affected medically (COVID-19 patients). This is probably the first empirical study discussing the recovery from COVID-19 disease, and specifically aiming at exploring the environmental impact on COVID-19 recovered patients. The sample data is taken during the lockdown period in Wuhan from 23 rd January 2020 to 8 th April 2020. The novel econometric technique of Quantile-on-Quantile regression, recently proposed by Shin and Zhu (2016), is employed to capture the asymmetric association between environmental factors (TEMP, HUM, PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, SO 2 , NO 2 , and O 3 ) and number of recovered patients from COVID-19 disease. We observe the heterogeneity among the variables across different quantiles of both independent and dependent variables. The findings suggest that TEMP, PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, NO 2, and O 3 are negatively related to the COVID-19 recovery, while HUM and SO 2 show a positive association at most of the quantiles.

In many cases, the output of kinetic energy harvesters is an alternating current (AC) requiring rectification in order to supply the electronic load. The rectifier design and selection can have a considerable influence on the energy harvesting system performance in terms of extracted output power and conversion losses. This paper presents a quantitative comparison of three passive rectifiers in a low-power, low-voltage electromagnetic energy harvesting sub-system, namely the full-wave bridge rectifier (FWR), the voltage doubler (VD), and the negative voltage converter rectifier (NVC). Based on a variable reluctance energy harvesting system, we investigate each of the rectifiers with respect to their performance and their effect on the overall energy extraction. We conduct experiments under the conditions of a low-speed rotational energy harvesting application with rotational speeds of 5 rpm to 20 rpm, and verify the experiments in an end-to-end energy harvesting evaluation. Two performance metrics-power conversion efficiency (PCE) and power extraction efficiency (PEE)-are obtained from the measurements to evaluate the performance of the system implementation adopting each of the rectifiers. The results show that the FWR with PEEs of 20% at 5 rpm to 40% at 20 rpm has a low performance in comparison to the VD (40-60%) and NVC (20-70%) rectifiers. The VD-based interface circuit demonstrates the best performance under low rotational speeds, whereas the NVC outperforms the VD at higher speeds (>18 rpm). Finally, the end-to-end system evaluation is conducted with a self-powered rpm sensing system, which demonstrates an improved performance with the VD rectifier implementation reaching the system's maximum sampling rate (40 Hz) at a rotational speed of approximately 15.5 rpm.","output":"System Implementation Trade-Offs for Low-Speed Rotational Variable Reluctance Energy Harvesters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection and location of image splicing forgery are a challenging task in the field of image forensics.

In this paper, we propose a new image tamper location method based on dual-channel U-Net, that is, DCU-Net. The detection framework based on DCU-Net is mainly divided into three parts: encoder, feature fusion, and decoder. Firstly, high-pass filters are used to extract the residual of the tampered image and generate the residual image, which contains the edge information of the tampered area. Secondly, a dual-channel encoding network model is constructed. The input of the model is the original tampered image and the tampered residual image. Then, the deep features extracted from the dual-channel encoding network are fused for the first time, and then the tampered features with different granularity are extracted by dilation convolution, and then, the secondary fusion is carried out. Finally, the fused feature map is input into the decoder, and the predicted image is decoded layer by layer. The experimental results on Casia2.0 and Columbia datasets show that DCU-Net performs better than the latest algorithm and can accurately locate tampered areas.

This predictive task is challenging due to the novelty of the virus, limited data, and dynamic political and societal responses. We embed a Bayesian time series model and a random forest algorithm within an epidemiological compartmental model for empirically grounded COVID-19 predictions. The Bayesian case model fits a location-specific curve to the velocity (first derivative) of the log transformed cumulative case count, borrowing strength across geographic locations and incorporating prior information to obtain a posterior distribution for case trajectories. The compartmental model uses this distribution and predicts deaths using a random forest algorithm trained on COVID-19 data and population-level characteristics, yielding daily projections and interval estimates for cases and deaths in U.S. states. We evaluated the model by training it on progressively longer periods of the pandemic and computing its predictive accuracy over 21-day forecasts. The substantial variation in predicted trajectories and associated uncertainty between states is illustrated by comparing three unique locations: New York, Colorado, and West Virginia.

The nsp5 structure contains two chymotrypsin-like domains (D1 and D2) and a unique domain (D3), and forms functional dimers. However, little is known of interactions or communication across the structure of the protease during nsp5 activity. Using reverse genetic mutagenesis of the CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp5, we identified a new temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in D2 of nsp5 (Ser133Ala) and confirmed a ts residue in D3 (Phe219Leu). Both D2-tsS133A and D3-tsF219L were impaired for viral replication and nsp5-mediated polyprotein processing at the nonpermissive temperature. Passage of tsS133A and tsF219L at the nonpermissive temperature resulted in emergence of multiple second-site suppressor mutations, singly and in combinations.

Among the 38 630 patients with IHCAs, 7571 (19.6%) were non-Hispanic Black, 26 715 (69.2%) were non-Hispanic White, and 16 732 (43.3%) were female; the mean (SD) age at admission was 76.3 (7.8) years. The median risk-adjusted IHCA incidence was 8.5 per 1000 admissions (95% CI, 8.2-9.0 per 1000 admissions). After adjusting for differences in case-mix index, IHCA incidence varied markedly across hospitals ranging from 2.4 per 1000 admissions to 25.5 per 1000 admissions (IQR, 6.6-11.4; median odds ratio, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.44-1.58]). Among hospital variables, a higher case-mix index, higher nurse staffing, and teaching status were associated with a lower hospital incidence of IHCA. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that the incidence of IHCA varies markedly across hospitals, and hospitals with higher nurse staffing and teaching status had lower IHCA incidence rates. Future studies are needed to better understand processes of care at hospitals with exceptionally low IHCA incidence to identify best practices for cardiac arrest prevention.","output":"Variation Across Hospitals in In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Incidence Among Medicare Beneficiaries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a sample of 21 developing and developed countries, we analyze whether a well-diversified investor of traditional assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities) may benefit from investing in cryptocurrencies.

Out-of-sample analysis indicates that even global portfolios that already benefits from international diversification may enjoy investing marginally in cryptocurrencies: mean-variance optimal and naive with cryptocurrencies outperformed otherwise identical portfolios in terms of risk-adjusted returns. Besides, exchange rate movements do not drive this better performance -- it occurs for both local (all returns denominated in the local currency) and global perspectives (all returns in U.S. Dollars). We also find that cryptocurrencies' diversification benefits occur both before and after the COVID-19 pandemics, with the 1/N portfolio with cryptocurrencies presenting the higher risk-adjusted returns.

The question quickly arose as to whether it was appropriate to offer medical students the opportunity to assist this staff. The dilemma stems in part from the potential impact on their psychological well-being as well as their academic and clinical performances. We sought to determine the level of anxiety of medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, and whether it was higher among the students who chose to return to the clinical setting, especially in first-line units (i.e., emergency departments and resuscitation units). In May 2020, 1180/1502 (78.5%) undergraduate medical students at Strasbourg Medical School (France) completed a questionnaire assessing their anxiety and clinical experience. A 2018 cohort of undergraduate medical students served as the baseline. The 2020 COVID cohort had higher rates of anxiety than the 2018 cohort. This difference was specifically observed in the students who chose not to return to the clinical setting during the crisis (N = 684, 59%). At linear regression, the main factors associated with anxiety were gender (p < 0.005) and perceived clinical activity personal conditions (p < 0.001). Employment site, including COVID first-line units, was not correlated with anxiety. Working in the clinical setting during the COVID-19 outbreak is not a risk factor for anxiety in medical students. Instead, it is an active coping strategy, suggesting that there are no barriers to allowing students to return to clinical settings during a pandemic, including first-line units, in terms of their psychological well-being.","output":"And if we had to do it all over again, would we send medical students to the emergency departments during a pandemic?

(Method) This study aims to propose a novel deep learning method that can obtain better performance. We use the pseudo-Zernike moment (PZM), derived from Zernike moment, as the extracted features. Two settings are introducing: (i) image plane over unit circle;and (ii) image plane inside the unit circle. Afterward, we use a deep-stacked sparse autoencoder (DSSAE) as the classifier.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the value of serum amyloid A (SAA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as prognostic biomarkers in comparison to other predictors, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin levels. This study included 124 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and they were assigned to one of two groups: Mild and severe, based on the severity of the infection. Radiological and laboratory investigations were performed, including evaluation of CRP, ferritin, D-Dimer, SAA and CEA levels. Significantly higher levels of CRP, ferritin, D-Dimer, SAA and CEA were observed in severe cases. SAA was significantly correlated with CRP (r=0.422, P<0.001), ferritin (r=0.574, P<0.001), CEA (r=0.514, P<0.001) and computed tomography severity score (CT-SS; r=0.691, P<0.001). CEA was correlated with CRP (r=0.441, P<0.001), ferritin (r=0.349, P<0.001) and CT-SS (r=0.374, P<0.001). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for performance of SAA, CEA, ferritin, CRP and SAA showed the highest AUC value of 0.928, with a specificity of 93.1%, and a sensitivity of 98.5% at a cut-off of 16 mg/l. The multi-ROC curve for SAA and ferritin showed 100% specificity, 100% sensitivity and 100% efficiency, with an AUC of 1.000. Thus, combining SAA and ferritin may have guiding significance for predicting COVID-19 severity. SAA alone showed the highest prognostic significance. Both SAA and CEA were positively correlated with the CT-SS.

Aim: This study aims to assess the relationship between emotional-affective symptoms and glutathione concentrations and CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts in college students. Methods: College students (n = 177) completed standardized psychometric instruments, including the Perceived Stress Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Familiar Social and Friends Support Scale, and Rosenberg Scale. Blood samples were biochemically analyzed. Analyses of variance were conducted between four groups according to symptom severity. Results: A considerable prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms was observed and negatively correlated with self-esteem and socio-familiar support. Perceived stress was sexually dimorphic. Although biochemical parameters were within reference ranges, glutathione, CD4, and CD8 tended to be lower in participants with anxiety and depression symptoms, which may be of predictive value. Conclusion: The relationship between antioxidant/immune parameters and socio-affective scores is latent in undiagnosed college students who might develop affective disorders.

However, for patients with severe viral pneumonia, the corticosteroid treatment is highly controversial. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the effect and potential mechanism of corticosteroid administration in pandemic viral pneumonia. SOURCES: We comprehensively searched all manuscripts on corticosteroid therapy for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral pneumonia from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. CONTENT: We systematically summarized the effects of corticosteroid therapy for pandemic viral pneumonia and the potential mechanism of action for corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). IMPLICATIONS: Observational studies showed that corticosteroid treatment was associated with increased mortality and nosocomial infections for influenza and delayed virus clearance for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Limited data on corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 were reported. Corticosteroids were used in about a fifth of patients (670/2995, 22.4%). Although clinical observational studies reported the improvement in symptoms and oxygenation for individuals with severe COVID-19 who received corticosteroid therapy, case fatality rate in the corticosteroid group was significantly higher than that in the non-corticosteroid group (69/443, 15.6% versus 56/1310, 4.3%). Compared individuals with non-severe disease, those with severe disease were more likely to receive corticosteroid therapy (201/382, 52.6% versus 201/1310, 15.3%). Although there is no evidence that corticosteroid therapy reduces mortality in people with COVID-19, some improvements in clinical symptoms and oxygenation were reported in some clinical observational studies. Excessive inflammatory response and lymphopenia might be critical factors associated with severity of and mortality from COVID-19. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials with rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardized dose and duration of corticosteroids are needed to verify the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy.","output":"Corticosteroid administration for viral pneumonia: COVID-19 and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Providing high-quality training to residency students during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a goal of our institution. Since 2108, we began to take microlectures to students teaching. Microlectures are online presentations, and the microlecture teaching method has many advantages, such as a short teaching time, situational resource composition, diverse communication, strong pertinence and can attend microlectures from home. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the advantages of the microlecture teaching method on students in standardized residency training. METHODS Students from our department were randomly divided into the traditional teaching group (control group) and the microlecture teaching group (observation group). The teaching duration for both groups was 3 months. All students were assessed on basic knowledge of the neurology before enrollment. After the teaching session, the students were assessed on teaching effect, theoretical operation, and clinical practice satisfaction. The students also evaluated the teachers, and the teachers evaluated the students. RESULTS A total of 84 students participated in the study and were divided equally into the observation group (42 students) and the control group (42 students). The results showed that the rate of reaching the standard of teaching effect, achievement of theory and operation, satisfaction with clinical practice, the student's grades by teachers, and student satisfaction with teachers were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (all P<0.05).

METHODS: The PrEP in pregnancy and postpartum (PrEP\\\\PP) study enrolled consenting pregnant, HIV\\\\negative women at first antenatal care (ANC) visit with follow\\\\up through 12 months postpartum. Eligible and consenting women and girls 16 years received HIV prevention counselling and were offered PrEP. Interviewers collected socio\\\\demographic and behavioural data from participants at each visit. We analysed the proportion of women who initiated PrEP and the proportion who continued PrEP after 3 months with associated correlates by estimating the prevalence ratio adjusting for a priori confounders. RESULTS: Between August 2019 and October 2021, we enrolled 1201 pregnant women (median gestation 21 weeks; age 26 years); 84% of women initiated PrEP at their first ANC visit (n = 1014); 55% were married or cohabiting. Overall, 66% of women on PrEP returned for a repeat prescription at 1 month; 58% returned at 3 months (n = 493 of 844). Almost one\\\\half of women on PrEP reported a side effect at 1 month, mostly nausea/vomiting. Women on PrEP in the first and second trimesters had higher odds of reporting side effects (aOR 2.61; 95% CI 1.17C5.84) versus postpartum women. Women who reported side effects continued with PrEP less than those who did not report side effects (aPR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.77C0.97). Women with 1 previous pregnancy (aPR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.57C1.01) or were postpartum (aPR 0.85; 95% CI 0.75C0.97) were less likely to continue PrEP compared to women who were primigravid or pregnant.

Based on disease severity, the COVID-19 patients were classified into four types: mild (n=15), moderate (n=59), severe (n=19), and critical (n=3). Based on hospital stay and number of computed tomography (CT) scans, the clinical/disease course was divided into four stages, including stage 1 (days 0-4), stage 2 (days 5-9), stage 3 (days 10-14), and stage 4 (days 15-19). The HRCT findings, CT value, and lesion volume were analyzed for each stage and compared among the four stages of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: CT findings were negative over the four stages for all mild COVID-19 patients. More lesions were found in the peripheral lung fields than in peripheral + central fields (P<0.05), and the number of negative patients in stage 4 were more than those in stages 1-3 (P<0.05).

We calculate both the number of advantageous mutations in the population that have accumulated by time t and the amount of viral adaptation transmitted to a susceptible compartment, the latter being called the Evolutionary Infectivity Profile (EIP). To this end we employ first a simple compartmental SIR model with a single parameter describing reduction in transmission due to vaccination. Then we switch to a model which actuates the full vaccine dynamics, including vaccination rate and short duration of immunity. In our models we have never come across a situation where vaccination plays a dominant role in driving new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

STUDY DESIGN: Children aged <16 years with episodes of respiratory tract infections and detectable entero/rhinovirus RNA in respiratory samples between November 2009 and December 2010 were investigated. Retrospective case review was performed and patients characteristics recorded. RESULTS: Entero/rhinoviruses were the commonest viral pathogens (498/2316; 21.5%). Amongst 204 infection episodes associated with entero/rhinovirus, 167 were typed HRV, HRV-C was the most prevalent (99/167, 59.3%) followed by HRV-A (60/167; 35.9%) and HRV-B (8/167, 4.8%). The severity spectrum of HRV-A and HRV-C infections were similar and affected all parts of the respiratory tract. Co-pathogens were observed in 54 (26.5%) episodes. Severity was increased in patients with non-viral co-pathogens and those with an underlying respiratory condition. Univariate and multiple regression analyses of potential prognostic variables including age, co-pathogens and underlying respiratory illnesses showed that mono-infection with HRV-C, as compared with other HRV species, was associated with more severe disease in young children <3 years. CONCLUSIONS: HRV-C was the most prevalent species and on its own was associated with severe disease in children <3 years.

In this post-epidemic era, these countries began to revive their economy. However, pollution remains in the environment, and peoples physical and psychological health has been under threat due to some over-prevention behaviors. Instruments for governmental agencies to manage these behaviors are not yet available. This study aims to develop a measurement model to identify and measure the degree of over-prevention behaviors during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. METHODS: A survey online was conducted to collect cognition from 1528 Chinese people, including descriptions of various over-prevention behaviors defined by health authorities. Factor analyses were used to develop the measurement model and test its validity. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore demographic characteristics, indicating people who are inclined to exhibit over-prevention behaviors. RESULTS: Four main factors were extracted to develop the model (eigenvalue = 7.337, 3.157, 1.447, and 1.059, respectively). The overall reliability (Cronbachs  = 0.900), the convergent (AVE > 0.5, CR > 0.8 for each factor) and discriminant validity is good. There is also a good internal consistency among these factors (Cronbachs  = 0.906, 0.852, 0.882, and 0.763, respectively). In Factor 1, gender has a negative effect (Beta = ? 0.294, P < 0.05, OR = 0.745), whereas employment has a positive effect.

We hypothesized that the commonly prescribed medicines for treatment of underlying chronic diseases can affect host responses to FLUAV infection and thus contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether commonly prescribed medicines could affect host responses to virus infection in vitro. Methods: We first identified 45 active compounds from a list of commonly prescribed medicines.

Finally, we tested the effect of 45 drugs on the viability, transcription, and metabolism of mock- and FLUAV-infected human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Results: In silico drugCtarget interaction analysis revealed that drugs such as atorvastatin, candesartan, and hydroxocobalamin could target and modulate FLUAVChost cell interaction. In vitro experiments showed that at non-cytotoxic concentrations, these compounds affected the transcription and metabolism of FLUAV- and mock-infected cells.

However, the impact of infection mimics on P-gp/BCRP function in human brain endothelium is less well understood. We hypothesized that Toll-like receptor ligands mimicking bacterial and viral infection would modify the expression and function of P-gp and BCRP in human brain endothelial cells (BECs). Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) were challenged with bacterial [Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] and viral-mimics [polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)], or pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interferon gamma (IFN)-?.

Thus, SMS is particularly challenging to study with online research, where variability in participants hardware and software can introduce uncontrolled latency and jitter into recordings. Here we present REPP (Rhythm ExPeriment Platform), a novel technology for measuring SMS in online experiments that can work efficiently using the built-in microphone and speakers of standard laptop computers. In a series of calibration and behavioral experiments, we demonstrate that REPP achieves high temporal accuracy (latency and jitter within 2 ms on average), high test-retest reliability both in the laboratory (r = .87) and online (r = .80), and high concurrent validity (r = .94).

In the absence of a cure and an AIDS vaccine, there is a pressing need to prevent new infections in order to curb the disease. Topical microbicides that block viral entry into human cells can potentially prevent HIV infection.

We show that griffithsin accumulates in stably transformed tobacco chloroplasts to up to 5% of the total soluble protein of the plant. Griffithsin can be easily purified from leaf material and shows similarly high virus neutralization activity as griffithsin protein recombinantly expressed in bacteria. We also show that dried tobacco provides a storable source material for griffithsin purification, thus enabling quick scale-up of production on demand.

Objective: To investigate whether state-imposed stay-at-home orders (SAHOs) and the proportion of African American population in a state were associated with the state-level COVID-19 cases. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used daily, state-level data on COVID-19 cases, tests, and fatalities from the COVID Tracking Project. Data from March 1 to May 4, 2020, for all states (except Washington state) as well as the District of Columbia were used. Exposures: The key exposure variables were state-level SAHO (1 if in place, 0 otherwise), and proportion of state population who are African American. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was daily cumulative COVID-19 case rates. A secondary outcome was subsequent COVID-19 fatality rates, derived using mean cumulative fatality rates 21 to 28 days after each date. Multivariate regression models were estimated. Results: The final sample included 3023 pooled state- and day-level observations. The mean (SD) cumulative positive case rate was 103.186 (200.067) cases per 100a?000 state population, the mean (SD) cumulative test rate was 744.23 (894.944) tests per 100a?000 state population, and the mean (SD) subsequent cumulative fatality rate was 12.923 (21.737) deaths per 100a?000 state population.

To maximize the benefits of strength training, adequate protein intake is also important. However, the number of older individuals that consume enough protein or routinely engage in strength training remains low at less than 5% and even lower for activities that challenge balance. Our primary aim was to assess the feasibility of implementing a model (MoveStrong) of service delivery to teach older adults about balance and functional strength training and methods to increase protein intake. METHODS: This study was a closed cohort stepped wedge randomized controlled trial. We recruited individuals 60 years considered pre-frail or frail with at least one chronic condition who were not currently engaging in regular strength training from Northern (rural) and Southern (urban) Ontario sites in Canada. The primary outcome was feasibility of implementation, defined by recruitment, retention, and adherence, and safety (defined by monitoring adverse events). We also reported participants and providers experience with MoveStrong, adaptations to the model based on participants and providers experience, and program fidelity. RESULTS: We recruited 44 participants to the study and the average adherence rate was 72% with a retention of 71%. The program had a high-fidelity score. One person experienced a fall-related injury during exercise, while two other participants reported pain during certain activities. Five individuals experienced injuries or health problems that were not related to the program. Suggestions for future trials include modifying some exercises, exploring volunteer assistance, increasing the diversity of participants enrolled, and considering a different study design.

Background: This study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 isolation's impact on digital device use by comparing hours spent on digital devices before and during the 24-hour curfew in Saudi Arabia, while assessing the symptoms associated with digital eye strain. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire was used to compare the total hours per day, either continuous or intermittent, spent on digital devices during and before curfew, and the association of these durations with digital eye strain. Results: A total of 1,939 participants, (mean  SD: 33  12.2 years and 72% women) were recruited. Results showed a significant difference between usage duration before and during curfew. Digital eye strain incidence was 78% during the curfew. Chi-squared analysis indicated most symptoms are associated with usage duration and employment status. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between digital eye strain and the following factors: using more than one device (odds ratio 1.208, 95% confidence interval: 1.068-1.3661), age, optical correction, employment status, gender, using rewetting drops, and usage duration. Conclusions: In this population, prolonged use of digital devices significantly increased during home-isolation. Digital eye strain incidence increased during curfew.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a representative healthcare claims database of approx. 4 million adults to estimate the incidence rates (IR) and associated mortality of CAP in 2015. IR and mortality were stratified by treatment setting, age group, and risk group status. A pneumonia coded in the primary diagnosis position or in the second diagnosis position with another pneumonia-related condition coded in the primary position was used as the base cases definition for the study. Sensitivity analyses using broader and more restrictive case definitions were also performed. RESULTS: The overall IR of CAP in adults &#8805;18 years was 1,054 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation. In adults aged 16 to 59 years, IR for overall CAP, hospitalized CAP and outpatient CAP was 551, 96 and 466 (with a hospitalization rate of 17%). In adults aged &#8805;60 years, the respective IR were 2,032, 1,061 and 1,053 (with a hospitalization rate of 52%). If any pneumonia coded in the primary or secondary diagnosis position was considered for hospitalized patients, the IR increased 1.5-fold to 1,560 in the elderly &#8805;60 years. The incidence of CAP hospitalizations was substantially higher in adults &#8805;18 years with at-risk conditions and high-risk conditions (IR of 608 and 1,552, respectively), compared to adults without underlying risk conditions (IR 108). High mortality of hospitalized CAP in adults &#8805;18 was observed in-hospital (18.5%), at 30 days (22.9%) and at one-year (44.5%) after CAP onset. Mortality was more than double in older adults in comparison to younger patients. CONCLUSION: CAP burden in older adults and individuals with underlying risk conditions was high.

Particular attention has been paid to delays in accessing timely pediatric care leading to unintended morbidity. In this study, we aim to describe the broader spectrum of unintended negative consequences for pediatric patients and families due to recent health care and societal changes. METHODS: All full-time doctors, dentists, and nurse practitioners working at a tertiary care children's hospital in Canada were surveyed every 2 weeks throughout the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify clinical cases in which they perceived a negative outcome associated with hospital or societal changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis followed a qualitative case series methodology using a narrative synthesis approach to determine similarities and associated themes. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one clinicians, representing 26 hospital divisions, reported 57 unique cases in the first 6 weeks of the study. Thematic analysis of the first 50 reported cases was used to identify 6 primary themes focusing on health care quality domains as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable care). CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary case analysis, we describe the broad social and clinical impact of COVID-19 on hospitalized pediatric patients and their families.

METHODS: A consensus conference on the spectrum of lungCkidney interactions in critical illness was held under the auspices of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) in Innsbruck, Austria, in June 2018. Through review and critical appraisal of the available evidence, the current state of research, and both clinical and research recommendations were described on the following topics: epidemiology, pathophysiology and strategies to mitigate pulmonary dysfunction among patients with acute kidney injury and/or kidney dysfunction among patients with acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, emphasis was put on patients receiving organ support (RRT, IMV and/or ECMO) and its impact on lung and kidney function. CONCLUSION: The ADQI 21 conference found significant knowledge gaps about organ crosstalk between lung and kidney and its relevance for critically ill patients.

A web-based survey of antimicrobial leads gathered data about the use of procalcitonin testing. Responses were received from 148/151 (98%) eligible hospitals. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was widespread introduction and expansion of PCT use in NHS hospitals. The number of hospitals using PCT in emergency/acute admissions rose from 17 (11%) to 74/146 (50.7%) and use in Intensive Care Units (ICU) increased from 70 (47.6%) to 124/147 (84.4%). This increase happened predominantly in March and April 2020, preceding NICE guidance. Approximately half of hospitals used PCT as a single test to guide decisions to discontinue antibiotics and half used repeated measurements. There was marked variation in the thresholds used for empiric antibiotic cessation and guidance about interpretation of values. Procalcitonin testing has been widely adopted in the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic in an unevidenced, heterogeneous way and in conflict with relevant NICE guidance.

Design: Retrospective cohort study including three propensity-matched groups. Setting: This study merged three data sources from a large United States health plan: a large national administrative claims database, an outpatient lab testing database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database. Participants: Individuals 18 to 65 years old with continuous health plan enrollment from January 2019 to date of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Three comparator groups were identified and propensity-score matched to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2: a 2020 comparator group, a historical 2019 comparator group and a historical comparator group with viral lower respiratory tract illness (vLRTI). Main outcome measures: Over 50 clinical sequelae during the post-acute phase (index date + 21 days) were ascertained using ICD-10 codes. Excess risk due to SARS-CoV-2 during the 4 months following the acute phase of illness and hazard ratios with 95% Bonferroni-corrected confidence intervals were calculated. Results: This study found 14% of adults []65 years of age who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=193113) had at least one new clinical sequelae that required medical attention during the post-acute phase of illness. When considering risk for specific sequelae attributable to SARS-Cov-2 infection during the post-acute phase, clinical outcomes including chronic respiratory failure, cardiac arrythmia, hypercoagulability, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia (memory difficulty), diabetes, liver test abnormalities, myocarditis, anxiety and fatigue were significantly elevated compared to the three propensity-matched comparator groups (2020, 2019, vLRTI). Significant risk differences due to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from 0.02 to 2.26 per 100 people and hazard ratios ranged from 1.24 to 25.65 when compared to the 2020 comparator group.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children less than 18 years of age presenting with new onset DM1 during the pandemic period of March 17, 2020 to August 31, 2020 was conducted at two tertiary care pediatric hospitals in Alberta, Canada. Rates of DKA and severe DKA were compared to the same time period in the year 2019 (pre\\\\pandemic control). RESULTS: The number of children presenting with newly diagnosed DM1 was similar during the pandemic year of 2020 compared with 2019 (107 children in 2020 vs. 114 in 2019).

This procedure is considerably time-consuming, in a situation where time might be of the essence. In this paper we use an Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique to identify a candidate primer set for the Omicron variant. The technique, based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been already exploited in the recent past to develop primers for the B.1.1.7/Alpha variant, that have later been successfully tested in the lab. Starting from available virus samples, the technique explores the space of all possible subsequences of viral RNA, evaluating them as candidate primers. The criteria used to establish the suitability of a sequence as primer includes its frequency of appearance in samples labeled as Omicron, its absence from samples labeled as other variants, a specific range of melting temperature, and its CG content. The resulting primer set has been validated in silico and proves successful in preliminary laboratory tests.

The team training programme included the three phases: (1) assessment and planning, (2) training and implementation and (3) sustainment. RESULTS Before implementing the team training programme, healthcare professionals were essentially satisfied with the teamwork skills within the ward. During the implementation of the programme, they experienced that team training led to greater awareness and knowledge of their common teamwork skills. Improved teamwork skills were described in relation to a more systematic interprofessional information exchange, consciousness of leadership-balancing activities and resources, the use of situational monitoring tools and a shared understanding of accountability and transparency.

Type I interferons (IFN)-/ are highly potent cytokines that are initially identified for their essential roles in antiviral defense. It was reported that HuNoV infection did not induce IFN- expression but was controlled in the presence of IFN- in human intestinal enteroids and a gnotobiotic pig model, suggesting that HuNoV has likely developed evasion countermeasures. In this study, we found that a cDNA clone of GII.4 HuNoV, the predominantly circulating genotype worldwide, inhibits the production of IFN- and identified the viral NTPase as a key component responsible for such inhibition. HuNoV NTPase not only inhibits the activity of IFN- promoter but also the mRNA and protein production of IFN-. Additional studies indicate that NTPase inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), leading to the suppression of IFN- promoter activation. Mechanistically, NTPase interacts with IkB kinase  (IKK), an important factor for IRF-3 phosphorylation, and such interaction blocks the association of IKK with unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, resulting in the inhibition of IKK phosphorylation. Further studies demonstrated that the 1-179 aa domain of NTPase which interacts with IKK is critical for the suppression of IFN- production. Our findings highlight the role of HuNoV NTPase in the inhibition of IFN- production, providing insights into a novel mechanism underlying how HuNoV evades the host innate immunity.","output":"Human Norovirus NTPase Antagonizes Interferon- Production by Interacting With IkB Kinase "},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glycosylation is the most common form of post-translational modification of proteins, critically affecting their structure and function. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for high-resolution site-specific quantification of glycopeptides coupled with high-throughput artificial intelligence-powered data processing, we analyzed differential protein glycoisoform distributions of 597 abundant serum glycopeptides and nonglycosylated peptides in 50 individuals who had been seriously ill with COVID-19 and in 22 individuals who had recovered after an asymptomatic course of COVID-19. As additional comparison reference phenotypes, we included 12 individuals with a history of infection with a common cold coronavirus, 16 patients with bacterial sepsis, and 15 healthy subjects without history of coronavirus exposure. We found statistically significant differences, at FDR < 0.05, for normalized abundances of 374 of the 597 peptides and glycopeptides interrogated between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Similar statistically significant differences were seen when comparing symptomatic COVID-19 patients to healthy controls (350 differentially abundant peptides and glycopeptides) and common cold coronavirus seropositive subjects (353 differentially abundant peptides and glycopeptides). Among healthy controls and sepsis patients, 326 peptides and glycopeptides were found to be differentially abundant, of which 277 overlapped with biomarkers that showed differential expression between symptomatic COVID-19 cases and healthy controls. Among symptomatic COVID-19 cases and sepsis patients, 101 glycopeptide and peptide biomarkers were found to be statistically significantly abundant. Using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we found specific glycoprotein profiles to be strongly predictive of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. LASSO-regularized multivariable logistic regression and K-means clustering yielded accuracies of 100% in an independent test set and of 96% overall, respectively. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that a majority of glycoprotein modifications observed which are shared among symptomatic COVID-19 and sepsis patients likely represent a generic consequence of a severe systemic immune and inflammatory state. However, there are glycoisoform changes that are specific and particular to severe COVID-19 infection. These may be representative of either COVID-19-specific consequences or susceptibility to or predisposition for a severe course of the disease. Our findings support the potential value of glycoproteomic biomarkers in the biomedical understanding and, potentially, the clinical management of serious acute infectious conditions.","output":"Differential Peripheral Blood Glycoprotein Profiles in Symptomatic and Asymptomatic COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Asthma is a common chronic disease presenting with airway symptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness and attacks of breathlessness. Underdiagnosis of asthma is common and correlates to negative outcomes such as a lower quality of life and reduced work capacity. Purpose: This study aims to identify factors for not being diagnosed with asthma if presenting with asthma symptoms. Patients and Methods: A questionnaire was sent to 45,000 subjects (age 16-74 years) in Sweden. Subjects who reported both wheeze and breathlessness and wheeze when not having a cold were defined as having asthma-related symptoms. Data on demographics, educational level, smoking, physical activity, comorbidities, symptoms and asthma were collected. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for not being diagnosed with asthma. Results: Of the 25,391 who responded to the survey, 6.2% reported asthma-related symptoms. Of these, 946 had been diagnosed with asthma previously, while 632 had not. Independent risk factors for not being diagnosed with asthma were higher age (OR (95% CI) (2.17 (1.39-3.40))), male sex (1.46 (1.17-1.81)), current smoking (2.92 (2.22-3.84)), low level of education (1.43 (1.01-2.01)), low physical activity (1.36 (1.06-1.74)), and hypertension (1.50 (1.06-2.12)).

Recently, in late December 2019, a novel Betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, originating from the Chinese city of Wuhan, emerged and was then identified as the causative agent of a new severe form of pneumonia, COVID-19. Real-time genome sequencing in such viral outbreaks is a key issue to confirm identification and characterization of the involved pathogen and to help establish public health measures. Here, we implemented an amplicon-based sequencing approach combined with easily deployable next-generation sequencers, the small and hand-held MinION sequencer and the latest most compact Illumina sequencer, the iSeq100(TM) system. Our results highlighted the great potential of the amplicon-based approach to obtain consensus genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples in just a few hours. Both these mobile next-generation sequencers are proven to be efficient to obtain viral sequences and easy to implement, with a minimal laboratory environment requirement, providing useful opportunities in the field and in remote areas.","output":"Rapid Genomic Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 by Direct Amplicon-Based Sequencing Through Comparison of MinION and Illumina iSeq100(TM) System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, in Wuhan (China), health authorities reported several clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause, subsequently attributed to a novel coronavirus, identified as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2.

In this paper, we study the impact of COVID-19 deaths on period life expectancy at birth in Mexico by sex and state. We focus on the loss of life expectancy at different ages as a geographically comparable measure of the pandemics impact on the population in 2020. Results show that males have been affected more than women since they have lost more years of life expectancy at birth due to COVID-19, and they have also experienced a high variation of life expectancy loss across states. The biggest life expectancy loss concentrates in the Northeastern, Central, and Southeastern (Yucatan peninsula) states. Considering the likely undercount associated with COVID-19 deaths, sensitivity analysis suggests that the new coronavirus is having a much larger impact on life expectancy in Mexico than the official government data appears to indicate.

With 17% of the world's population, India has so far had 13% of global COVID-19 infections and 8.5% of deaths. Maharashtra accounting for 9% of India's population, is the worst affected state, with 19% of infections and 33% of total deaths in the country until 23rd December 2020. Though a number of studies have examined the vulnerability to and spread of COVID-19 and its effect on mortality, no attempt has been made to understand its impact on mortality in the states of India. METHOD: Using data from multiple sources and under the assumption that COVID-19 deaths are additional deaths in the population, this paper examined the impact of the disease on premature mortality, loss of life expectancy, years of potential life lost (YPLL), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in Maharashtra. Descriptive statistics, a set of abridged life tables, YPLL, and DALY were used in the analysis. Estimates of mortality indices were compared pre- and during COVID-19. RESULT: COVID-19 attributable deaths account for 5.3% of total deaths in the state and have reduced the life expectancy at birth by 0.8 years, from 73.2 years in the pre-COVID-19 period to 72.4 years by the end of 2020. If COVID-19 attributable deaths increase to 10% of total deaths, life expectancy at birth will likely reduce by 1.4 years. The probability of death in 20-64 years of age (the prime working-age group) has increased from 0.15 to 0.16 due to COVID-19. There has been 1.06 million additional loss of years (YPLL) in the state, and DALY due to COVID-19 has been estimated to be 6 per thousand. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has increased premature mortality, YPLL, and DALY and has reduced life expectancy at every age in Maharashtra.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 infection on life expectancy, premature mortality, and DALY in Maharashtra, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This study evaluates the correlation between closed, semi-closed and open-cell stent design and the association between stent type and clinical outcome as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. DESIGN A total of 194 patients who underwent unprotected carotid artery stenting (CAS) as well as diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) before and after intervention were retrospectively reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three stent designs were studied: closed cell, semi-closed cell and open cell. Spearman's Rho test was performed between the stent free cell area and the number and area of ischaemic lesions found after intervention. Adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the three stent groups (Zilver, Cook Europe, Denmark; Smart, Codman, MA; and Wallstent, Stryker, MN, USA). A significant correlation was found between the stent free cell area and the number and area of new ischaemic lesions on DW-MRI (P = 0.023). There were significantly fewer new lesions with an open-cell design (Zilver; 12.76 mm(2) free cell area) than with a closed-cell design (Wallstent; 1.08 mm(2) free cell area). CONCLUSIONS Open-cell stent was related to a lower number and area of silent cerebral ischaemic lesions after unprotected CAS.

We designed a study to measure STBBI prevalence among GBM in metropolitan Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver and to document related preventive and risk behaviours. METHODS: The Engage Cohort Study used respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to recruit GBM who reported sex with another man in the past 6 months. At baseline, we examined recruitment characteristics of the samples, and the RDS-II-adjusted distributions of socio-demographics, laboratory-confirmed HIV and other STBBI prevalence, and related behaviours, with a focus on univariate differences among cities. RESULTS: A total of 2449 GBM were recruited from February 2017 to August 2019. HIV prevalence was lower in Montreal (14.2%) than in Toronto (22.2%) or Vancouver (20.4%). History of syphilis infection was similar across cities (14C16%). Vancouver had more HIV-negative/unknown participants who reported never being HIV tested (18.6%) than Toronto (12.9%) or Montreal (11.5%). Both Montreal (74.9%) and Vancouver (78.8%) had higher proportions of men who tested for another STBBI in the past 6 months than Toronto (67.4%).

Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC)s EOC was officially established in 2016, which has been the core department for the public health emergencies and risk response. In recent years, we have been continuously improving the function of EOC through many incidents. In the study, we hope to share the construction status, operation management experience of China CDCs EOC and the response process in the human avian influenza A (H7N9) outbreak. MAIN TEXT: The China CDCs EOC mainly focus on building the five core elements including sites/places and facilities, information and data, plans and procedures, training and exercises, and logistics. Based on summarizing previous emergency response, the China CDCs EOC established its own incident management and the standardized response procedures. The event-specific data, context-specific data and event management data could be obtained through various source. The logistics department of the EOC also provides comprehensive support. The well-trained staff is another necessary conditions for its operation. Through sharing the response process of H7N9 outbreak, it further explains the EOCs functions in the five phases of outbreak response, such as the formulation of the incident response framework, monitoring, personnel dispatch and resource mobilization. CONCLUSIONS: The EOC contributes to faster and more efficient responses during emergencies which enable a greater reduction in morbidity and mortality. Compared with the traditional incident response process, under the command and coordination of China CDCs EOC, each group involved in the response has a clearer goal, responsibilities and tasks at each stage. Meanwhile, each group also gave full play to its own expertise and advantages. As a whole, incident response tended to be more specialized and precise, which generally improves the efficiency of incident response. However, different countries and regions have different response processes to the events. We still suggested that appropriate emergency operation plan should be made according to the complexity of incident response in the region when constructing response mechanism, through our experience. And the China CDCs EOC is still at growing and groping phase.

Secondary distribution of home-based HIV self-test kits by AGYW to male partners (MP) is a novel prevention strategy that complements pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a female-controlled prevention intervention. The objective of this analysis was to qualitatively operationalize two HIV prevention cascades through the lens of relationship dynamics for secondary distribution of HIV self-tests to MP and PrEP for AGYW. METHODS From April 2018 to December 2018, 2200 HIV-negative AGYW aged 16-24 years were enrolled into an HIV prevention intervention which involved secondary distribution of self-tests to MP and PrEP for AGYW; of these women, 91 participants or MP were sampled for in-depth interviews based on their degree of completion of the two HIV prevention cascades. A grounded theory approach was used to characterize participants' relationship profiles, which were mapped to participants' engagement with the interventions. RESULTS In cases where AGYW had a MP with multiple partners, AGYW perceived both interventions as inviting distrust into the relationship and insinuating non-monogamy. Many chose not to accept either intervention, while others accepted and attempted to deliver the self-test kit but received a negative reaction from their MP. In the few cases where AGYW held multiple partnerships, both interventions were viewed as mechanisms for protecting one's health, and these AGYW exhibited confidence in accepting and delivering the self-test kits and initiating PrEP. Women who indicated intimate partner violence experiences chose not to accept either intervention because they feared it would elicit a violent reaction from their MP. For AGYW in relationships described as committed and emotionally open, self-test kit delivery was completed with ease, but PrEP was viewed as unnecessary. MP experience with the cascade corroborated AGYW perspectives and demonstrated how men can perceive female-initiated HIV prevention options as beneficial for AGYW and a threat to MP masculinity. CONCLUSIONS Screening to identify AGYW relationship dynamics can support tailoring prevention services to relationship-driven barriers and facilitators. HIV prevention counseling for AGYW should address relationship goals or partner's influence, and engage with MP around female-controlled prevention interventions.","output":"Qualitative characterizations of relationships among South African adolescent girls and young women and male partners: implications for engagement across HIV self-testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis prevention cascades."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The environment is in crisis Climate science and biodiversity loss indicators, for example, illustrate the extent of environmental degradation and the concerns with the sustainability of Earth, or perhaps more specifically, the ability of Earth to sustain (human) life There is also an increasing recognition of the environmental crisis as urgent, as an emergency, yet whether we are acting sufficiently to the environmental crisis is still up for debate These debates have become more evident in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a context within which to consider what it means to respond to a crisis and how the environment might feature in any post-COVID recovery In this essay, we first outline and reflect on crisis, urgency and (in)action through a consideration of the environmental crisis and the COVID-19 crisis before moving to our main focus C the implications for environmental accounting Specifically, we suggest that the construction of environmental accounting as accounting for the long-term, an attempt to contrast it with and overcome the problems with short-term conventional accounting, potentially contributes to the construction of the environment as lacking urgency and potentially enables its marginalisation We argue that in order to make the most of accountings potential as a constitutive force, capable of participating in transforming preferences, decisions and behaviour in organisations and societies, environmental accounting needs to be about the short-term We contribute to the ongoing discussions on how accounting needs to change if it is to recognise the urgent nature of the environmental crisis","output":"On crisis and emergency: Is it time to rethink long-term environmental accounting?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 21st century already witnessed many deadly epidemics and pandemics. The major ones were respiratory tract infections like SARS (2003), H1N1 (2009), MERS (2012) and the most recent pandemic COVID-19 (2019). The COVID-19 story begins when pneumonia of unknown cause was reported in the WHO country office of China at the end of 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent that enters the host through the receptor ACE2, a component of the reninCangiotensin system. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Symptoms of COVID-19 varies from patient to patient. It is all about the immunity and health status of the individual that decides the severity of the disease. The review focuses on the significant and often prevailing factors, those that influence the lung function. The factors that compromise the lung functions which may prepare the ground for severe COVID-19 infection are interestingly looked into. Focus was more on air pollution and cigarette smoke. SHORT CONCLUSION: The fact that the forested areas across the world show very low COVID-19 infection rate suggests that we are in need of the Clean Air on the fiftieth anniversary of World Earth Day. As many policies are implemented worldwide to protect from SARS-CoV-2, one simple remedy that we forgot was clean air can save lives. SARS-CoV-2 infects our lungs, and air pollution makes us more susceptible. In this crucial situation, the focus is only on the main threat; all other conditions are only in words to console the situation.","output":"Impact of air pollution and smoking on COVID-19: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (especially SARS-CoV-2) are characterized by rapid mutation and wide spread. As these characteristics easily lead to global pandemics, studying the evolutionary relationship between viruses is essential for clinical diagnosis. DNA sequencing has played an important role in evolutionary analysis. Recent alignment-free methods can overcome the problems of traditional alignment-based methods, which consume both time and space. This paper proposes a novel alignment-free method called the correlation coefficient feature vector (CCFV), which defines a correlation measure of the L-step delay of a nucleotide location from its location in the original DNA sequence. The numerical feature is a 16  L-dimensional numerical vector describing the distribution characteristics of the nucleotide positions in a DNA sequence. The proposed L-step delay correlation measure is interestingly related to some types of L + 1 spaced mers. Unlike traditional gene comparison, our method avoids the computational complexity of multiple sequence alignment, and hence improves the speed of sequence comparison. Our method is applied to evolutionary analysis of the common human viruses including SARS-CoV-2, Dengue virus, Hepatitis B virus, and human rhinovirus and achieves the same or even better results than alignment-based methods. Especially for SARS-CoV-2, our method also confirms that bats are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Alignment-free sequence comparison for virus genomes based on location correlation coefficient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The livestock system is one of the most important characteristics of agrarian economy;livestock sector provides sustainability and stability to the national economy by contributing to farm energy and food security.

A total of 325 frozen, leftover respiratory samples collected from treatment-naive patients with presumptive TB in Germany (n = 280) and presumptive RIF-resistant TB in Sierra Leone (n = 45) were used in this study. cobas MTB results for detection of MTBC DNA from N-acetyl-l-cysteineCsodium hydroxide (NALCCNaOH)-treated samples were compared to culture results. Predictions of RIF and INH resistance by the cobas MTB-RIF/INH assay were compared to a composite reference standard (phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and line probe assay). Whole-genome sequencing was used to resolve discordances. The overall sensitivity of cobas MTB for detection of MTBC DNA in culture-positive samples (n = 102) was 89.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.7 to 93.9%). The specificity of cobas MTB was 98.6% (95% CI, 96.1 to 99.5%). Sensitivity and specificity for detection of RIF and INH resistance were 88.4% (95% CI, 75.5 to 94.9%) and 97.6% (95% CI, 87.4 to 99.6%) and 76.6% (95% CI, 62.8 to 86.4%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 90.8 to 100.0%), respectively. Discordant results for RIF and INH resistance were mainly due to uncommon mutations in samples from Sierra Leone that were not covered by the cobas MTB-RIF/INH assay. In conclusion, cobas MTB and MTB-RIF/INH assays provide accurate detection of MTBC DNA and resistance-associated mutations in respiratory samples.

The databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, WANFANG, and VIP were systemically searched for English and Chinese language articles evaluating DHTs for people with mental health problems in mainland China. Eligible studies were systematically reviewed. The heterogeneity of studies included precluded a meta-analysis. In total, 39 articles were retrieved, reporting on 32 DHTs for various mental health problems. Compared with the digital mental health field in the West, the Chinese studies targeted schizophrenia and substance use disorder more often and investigated social anxiety mediated by shame and culturally specific variants, DHTs were rarely developed in a co-production approach, and methodology quality was less rigorous. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review focused on digital mental health in the Chinese context including studies published in both English and the Chinese language.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of burnout and its associated factors among surgical specialists in Kuwait. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence of burnout among 489 surgeons in practice at Kuwait Ministry of Health (MOH). Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which defines burnout as having a high score of EE or DP, or a low score of PA; with severe burnout involving all. The associations between burnout or severe burnout with sociodemographic and occupational characteristics were assessed using multivariate binary logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: Prevalence estimates for burnout and severe burnout were 76.9% (95% Confidence Interval = 72.9-80.7%) and 14.0% (11.0-17.5%), respectively. The prevalence estimates for high EE, high DP, and low PA scores were 44.7, 43.1, and 47.2%, respectively. The prevalence of burnout and severe burnout was highest among neurosurgeons. Burnout was lowest among otolaryngology surgeons and severe burnout was lowest among cardiothoracic surgeons. After adjustment, burnout was associated with younger age, lower income, and more on-calls per month. The four most common sources of stress included less family time, verbal assault, case overload, and highly complicated cases. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of burnout among surgeons in Kuwait MOH hospitals is high.

This report is focused on HRV parameters kinetics before, during and after this lockdown period. METHODS: 95 participants were included in this study (27 women, 68 men, 37  11 years, 176  8 cm, 71  12 kg), who underwent regular orthostatic tests (a 5-minute supine followed by a 5-minute standing recording of heart rate (HR)) on a regular basis before (BSL), during (CFN) and after (RCV) the lockdown. HR, power in low- and high-frequency bands (LF, HF, respectively) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) were computed for each orthostatic test, and for each position. Subjective well-being was assessed on a 0C10 visual analogic scale (VAS). The participants were split in two groups, those who reported an improved well-being (WB+, increase >2 in VAS score) and those who did not (WB-) during CFN. RESULTS: Out of the 95 participants, 19 were classified WB+ and 76 WB-. There was an increase in HR and a decrease in RMSSD when measured supine in CFN and RCV, compared to BSL in WB-, whilst opposite results were found in WB+ (i.e. decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD in CFN and RCV; increase in LF and HF in RCV). When pooling data of the three phases, there were significant correlations between VAS and HR, RMSSD, HF, respectively, in the supine position; the higher the VAS score (i.e., subjective well-being), the higher the RMSSD and HF and the lower the HR. In standing position, HRV parameters were not modified during CFN but RMSSD was correlated to VAS. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the strict COVID-19 lockdown likely had opposite effects on French population as 20% of participants improved parasympathetic activation (RMSSD, HF) and rated positively this period, whilst 80% showed altered responses and deteriorated well-being. The changes in HRV parameters during and after the lockdown period were in line with subjective well-being responses. The observed recordings may reflect a large variety of responses (anxiety, anticipatory stress, change on physical activity) beyond the scope of the present study.

The restaurant industry is experiencing a dramatic transformation under the crossfire of these two driving forces. However, we are not fully exposed to those changes due to the lack of first-hand data, let alone the potential consequences and implications.

A probabilistic learning model is then proposed to decompose the aggregate foot traffic by service modes into those for dine-in and takeout, respectively. The transitions in demand structures are identified for restaurants of various service types, price levels, and locations. In general, our results evidence that the overall restaurant demand still drifted around half of the pre-pandemic level, far from a complete recovery, one year after the mandatory lockdown was ended.

Methods: We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic. Results: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%).

In this study, we used a natural experimental research design to identify whether urban greenery cushions the decrease in leisure-time physical activity caused by the pandemic and related social distancing measures in a high-density city. The two-wave physical activity data (before and during the pandemic) were collected for urban residents in neighborhoods with high or low levels of greenery. The results of difference-in-differences model suggest that urban greenery mitigated the decrease in physical activity during the pandemic. People who lived in greener neighborhoods experienced a lesser decrease in the leisure-time physical activity level than those who lived in less green neighborhoods. Additionally, people who lived in greener neighborhoods experienced increased levels of physical activity related to visits to country parks during the pandemic.

Demographic information, blood indices, osmotic fragility, serum iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) levels were evaluated for all the subjects. All subjects underwent a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis for &#945;-thal status, followed by a multiplex gap-PCR-based identification of the deletion type present. Sixty-seven subjects had at least one &#945;-thal deletion (16.22%). We observed that -&#945;3.7 (rightward), - -SEA (Southeast Asian), -&#945;4.2 (leftward), - -MED (Mediterranean) and - -THAI (Thailand) deletions were the most common &#945;-globin deletions present in the country, with the -&#945;3.7 (n = 37) and - -SEA (n = 18) being most prevalent. The osmotic fragility test (OFT) could predict the presence of &#945;-thal deletions with over 98.0% sensitivity. Complete UCB count analysis revealed significant differences between healthy subjects and subjects with &#945;-thal deletions. Although the iron level was almost the same (108.0 vs. 105.7 g/dL), a reduced level of Zn (98.6 vs. 71.8 g/dL, p < 0.01) was observed in the cord blood-derived serum of the subjects with &#945;-thal deletions. Moreover, parental age at the time of delivery, gestational period, and birth weight was lower in the subjects with &#945;-thal deletions. This study provides partial information on the epidemiology of &#945;-thal in Bangladesh and describes a model for &#945;-thal newborn screening in the country.","output":"Umbilical Cord Blood Screening for the Detection of Common Deletional Mutations of -Thalassemia in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare resources have been strained to previously unforeseeable limits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. This has prompted the emergence of critical just-in-time COVID-19 education, including rapid simulation preparedness, evaluation and training across all healthcare sectors. Simulation has been proven to be pivotal for both healthcare provider learning and systems integration in the context of testing and integrating new processes, workflows, and rapid changes to practice (e.g., new cognitive aids, checklists, protocols) and changes to the delivery of clinical care. The individual, team, and systems learnings generated from proactive simulation training is occurring at unprecedented volume and speed in our healthcare system. Establishing a clear process to collect and report simulation outcomes has never been more important for staff and patient safety to reduce preventable harm. Our provincial simulation program in the province of Alberta, Canada (population = 4.37 million; geographic area = 661,848 km2), has rapidly responded to this need by leading the intake, design, development, planning, and co-facilitation of over 400 acute care simulations across our province in both urban and rural Emergency Departments, Intensive Care Units, Operating Rooms, Labor and Delivery Units, Urgent Care Centers, Diagnostic Imaging and In-patient Units over a 5-week period to an estimated 30,000 learners of real frontline team members. Unfortunately, the speed at which the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged in Canada may prevent healthcare sectors in both urban and rural settings to have an opportunity for healthcare teams to participate in just-in-time in situ simulation-based learning prior to a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. Our coordinated approach and infrastructure have enabled organizational learnings and the ability to theme and categorize a mass volume of simulation outcome data, primarily from acute care settings to help all sectors further anticipate and plan. The goal of this paper is to share the unique features and advantages of using a centralized provincial simulation response team, preparedness using learning and systems integration methods, and to share the highest risk and highest frequency outcomes from analyzing a mass volume of COVID-19 simulation data across the largest health authority in Canada.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic preparation: using simulation for systems-based learning to prepare the largest healthcare workforce and system in Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references. RESULTS: Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.","output":"Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the most frequent pregnancy-specific liver disease.

The World Health Organization has also declared an infodemic (ie, a plethora of information regarding COVID-19 containing both false and accurate information circulated on the internet). Hence, it has become critical to test the veracity of information shared online and analyze the evolution of discussed topics among citizens related to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research analyzes the public discourse on COVID-19. It characterizes risk communication patterns in four Asian countries with outbreaks at varying degrees of severity: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India. METHODS: We collected tweets on COVID-19 from four Asian countries in the early phase of the disease outbreak from January to March 2020. The data set was collected by relevant keywords in each language, as suggested by locals. We present a method to automatically extract a time-topic cohesive relationship in an unsupervised fashion based on natural language processing. The extracted topics were evaluated qualitatively based on their semantic meanings. RESULTS: This research found that each government's official phases of the epidemic were not well aligned with the degree of public attention represented by the daily tweet counts. Inspired by the issue-attention cycle theory, the presented natural language processing model can identify meaningful transition phases in the discussed topics among citizens. The analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the tweet count and topic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper compares similarities and differences of pandemic-related social media discourse in Asian countries. We observed multiple prominent peaks in the daily tweet counts across all countries, indicating multiple issue-attention cycles. Our analysis identified which topics the public concentrated on; some of these topics were related to misinformation and hate speech. These findings and the ability to quickly identify key topics can empower global efforts to fight against an infodemic during a pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter in Four Asian Countries: Case Study of Risk Communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: to reflect on the dying process and death of patients with Covid-19 in the light of spirituality Development: Amid the pandemic caused by the new Coronavirus, we once again face the feared death, with an aggravating factor: increasing number of deaths characterized by the lack of opportunity for the individuals to say goodbye to their loved ones, dying patients accompanied only by health professionals, and bodies taken directly to the cemeteries It is worth discussing here an element through which most people seek strength: spirituality Final considerations: Understanding the sense of spirituality on the part of health professionals, in search of support for dying patients and bereaved families is important, as spirituality can be a potential factor of integration and harmonization of interpersonal relationships ? 2020, Universidade Federal do Parana All rights reserved","output":"The dying process and death of patients with COVID-19: A reflection in the light of spirituality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of an in vivo small bowel bioengineering model using allogeneic aortic grafts in pigs. BACKGROUND The best treatment for short bowel syndrome is still unclear. Intestinal transplantation, as well as lifelong parenteral nutrition is associated with a 5-year survival rate of less than 50 %. We have already used allogeneic arterial segments to replace the upper airway in sheep. The results were encouraging with an induced transformation of the aortic wall into tracheo-bronchial bronchial-type tissue. METHODS Seven young mini-pigs were used. A 10-cm-diameter, allogeneic, aortic graft was interposed in an excluded small bowel segment and wrapped by the neighboring omentum. Animals were autopsied at 1 (n = 2), 3 (n = 3), and 6 months (n = 2), respectively. Specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS The overall survival rate of the animals was 71.4 %. No anastomotic leak occurred. Histologic analysis revealed intestinal-like wall transformation of the aortic graft in the surviving animals. CONCLUSION Aortic-enteric anastomosis is feasible in a porcine model.

Regarding the transport sector specifically, the blocks implemented in several countries around the world, to contain the virus, resulted in a significant reduction in the number of trips between points of origin and destination, with only the essential ones advised. This reduction should also impact on congestion and the number of traffic incidents. Thus, this chapter seeks to test the hypothesis that isolation, due to COVID-19, resulted in a significant drop in the occurrence of traffic incidents, through the performance of statistical analyzes. In addition, this possible reduction is discussed as being an important strategy to achieve several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We used traffic incidents data in the Rio de Janeiro city made available by Traffic Engineering Company of the city. The results obtained through various statistical methods indicate that although the accident profile has not undergone significant changes, there was a sharp drop in the number of calls for traffic incidents, which can positively impact nine SDGs and 23 targets of the 2030 Agenda. It is also worth mentioning that although the blocking state is not permanent, the findings found can be used to improve the potential for mitigating traffic incidents in the future and help in a future planning of incident management. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Traffic Incidents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Step Towards Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasingly sophisticated technology and information systems provide their own risks namely with the presence of cyber or cyberspace (cybercrime).

It is increasingly important to research the effect of urbanization on CO(2) emissions, especially in large emerging and developing economies, due to the indispensable need for understanding the effect of urbanization on CO(2) emissions, evaluating carbon reduction tasks and providing the scientific basis for low-carbon urbanization. Utilizing a balanced panel dataset in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, during the period of 2000C2010, this paper employed data envelopment analysis (DEA) window analysis and a spatial lag panel Tobit model to investigate the effect of urbanization on CO(2) emissions efficiency (the ratio of the target CO(2) emissions to the actual CO(2) emissions). The results show that the average CO(2) emissions efficiency was 0.959 in 2010, and CO(2) emissions efficiency ranged from 0.816 to 1 and exhibited spatial clustering in the region. The larger potential of CO(2) emissions reduction appeared in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou, indicating that more CO(2) emissions reduction tasks should be allocated to these two cities. Urbanization has negative effects on improving CO(2) emissions efficiency, and there is a U-curve relation between CO(2) emissions efficiency and urbanization, indicating that CO(2) emissions efficiency decreases at the early stage of urbanization, then increases when urbanization reach a high level. There is spatial spillover effect among the prefecture-level cities, suggesting that different prefecture-level governments should coordinate with each other to improve CO(2) emissions efficiency in the whole area.

Based on a sample of 764 households with preschool-aged children in Wuhan, China, where the pandemic began, this study examined how primary caregivers perceived changes in the amount of time spent engaging with their children (i.e., engaged time) from the start of the pandemic and whether these changes were associated with children's learning behavior and emotional distress. The results showed that primary caregivers generally perceived increases in the amount of engaged time spent on indoor activities with their children but decreases in the amount of engaged time spent playing with their children outdoors. A bigger family size and greater loss of family income during the pandemic were associated with bigger perceived increases in caregivers engaged time spent on indoor activities, whilst a higher level of parental education was associated with bigger perceived decreases in engaged time spent playing with children outdoors. The family's poorer physical health and higher levels of chaos during the pandemic were related to smaller perceived increases in caregivers engaged time spent on educational activities. Finally, although bigger perceived increases in caregivers indoor engaged time (e.g., time spent on educational activities) were associated with higher levels of positive learning behavior and fewer symptoms of anxiety and withdrawal in the children, bigger perceived decreases in outdoor play time were associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety and withdrawal. These findings offer valuable insights into caregivers allocation of engaged time with their preschool-aged children during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Caregivers perceived changes in engaged time with preschool-aged children during COVID-19: Familial correlates and relations to children's learning behavior and emotional distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Experts have suggested that earlier delivery, even in non-severe cases, may be beneficial for patients with COVID, and that patients with COVID have higher rates of cesarean section. Factors associated with this increase are currently unclear. We sought to assess demographic and clinical factors associated with cesarean section (CS) in pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID. Study Design: Retrospective cohort of PCR-confirmed COVID positive pregnant patients in a single health system who delivered between March-December of 2020. Fetal death or planned CS excluded. Demographic data, pregnancy characteristics, and specifics of COVID infection ed and compared between patients who had vaginal delivery(SVD) and CS. Secondary analysis performed for symptomatic(sx) and asymptomatic(asx) patients separately. Bivariate statistics used to analyze the data. Multivariate Poisson regression performed to estimate adjusted relative risks. Results: Of 109 COVID positive patients, 19(17.4%) had planned CS. Of 91 with labor, 22(24%) had CS. CS was associated with overall BMI > 39.9(Table1). Non-private insurance and higher maternal age were associated with significantly higher rates of CS. Multiparity was not associated with SVD. Hypertensive disorders(PEC) of pregnancy and intraamniotic infection(IAI) were also associated with CS(Table 1). In regression analyses, symptomatic disease was associated with SVD [aRR 0.41, 95%CI 0.18, 0.93].

However, less is known about the relationship between CAD and cancer. The present study aimed to identify the risk factors for CAD and cancer, as well as the relationship between CAD and cancer. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1600 patients between January 2012 and June 2019 were enrolled and divided into groups according to whether they had CAD or cancer. Single-factor and multivariate analysis methods were applied to examine the risk factors for CAD and cancer. RESULTS: (1) Cancer prevalence was significantly higher in patients with CAD than in patients without CAD (47.2 vs. 20.9%). The prevalence of CAD in cancer and non-cancer patients was 78.9 and 52.4%, respectively. (2) Multivariable logistic regression showed that patients with cancer had a higher risk of developing CAD than non-cancer patients (OR: 2.024, 95% CI: 1.475 to 2.778, p < 0.001). Respiratory (OR: 1.981, 95% CI: 1.236C3.175, p = 0.005), digestive (OR: 1.899, 95% CI: 1.177C3.064, p = 0.009) and urogenital (OR: 3.595, 95% CI: 1.696C7.620, p = 0.001) cancers were significantly associated with a higher risk of CAD compared with no cancer. (3) Patients with CAD also had a higher risk of developing cancer than non-CAD patients (OR = 2.157, 95% CI: 1.603 to 2.902, p < 0.001). Patients in the Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level  40 U/L group had a lower risk of cancer than patients in the ALT level < 20 U/L group (OR: 0.490, 95% CI: 0.333C0.722, p < 0.001).

It is a resinous material having mixtures of wax and bee enzymes. Propolis is also known as bee glue and used by bees as a building material in their hives, for blocking holes and cracks, repairing the combs and strengthening their thin borders. It has been extensively used since ancient times for different purposes in traditional human healthcare practices. The quality and composition of propolis depend on its geographic location, climatic zone and local flora. The New Zealand and Brazilian green propolis are the two main kinds that have been extensively studied in recent years. Their bioactive components have been found to possess a variety of therapeutic potentials. It was found that Brazilian green propolis improves the cognitive functions of mild cognitive impairments in patients living at high altitude and protects them from neurodegenerative damage through its antioxidant properties. It possesses artepillin C (ARC) as the key component, also known to possess anticancer potential. The New Zealand propolis contains caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) as the main bioactive with multiple therapeutic potentials. Our lab performed in vitro and in vivo assays on the extracts prepared from New Zealand and Brazilian propolis and their active ingredients. We provided experimental evidence that these extracts possess anticancer, antistress and hypoxia-modulating activities. Furthermore, their conjugation with CD proved to be more effective. In the present review, we portray the experimental evidence showing that propolis has the potential to be a candidate drug for different ailments and improve the quality of life.","output":"Experimental Evidence for Therapeutic Potentials of Propolis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Social Work discipline emerged in the earlier 20th century globally and in 1953 in Pakistan. Medical Social Work, as a branch of Social Work, deals with non-medical factors affecting diseases.

Restrictive measures included social distancing, home confinement and the closure of all public structures like gyms and swimming pools. The impact of these limitations on health and lifestyle was inevitably negative. The purpose of this study was to establish the level of physical activity (PA), expressed as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week) in a Southern Italian population before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: An adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) was published on the official website of the National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS S. de Bellis, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy and on several social media in May 2020. RESULTS: Three hundred ten replies (72% women) from Apulia (60%), Calabria (28%), Campania (11%) and Sicily (1%) were included in the study. The COVID-19 lockdown had a negative effect on the vigorous PA intensity level and on walking, but not on the moderate PA intensity level. Additionally, daily time spent sitting down increased by more than 12% during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation changed PA behaviors.

The purpose of this study is to review the potential of dHACM to facilitate post-surgical and myelomeningocele wound repair. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was conducted to identify studies investigating dHACM use in pediatric and surgical wound care published from inception to October 2020. For each study, patient characteristics, wound characteristics, and outcomes following dHACM application were documented and assessed. Of the 190 articles reviewed, 15 publications were included in the final analysis. Results demonstrated that the average wound healing time varied across clinical indications (e.g., 14 days for trauma reconstruction to 116 days for Moh's surgery repair). Across indications, pediatric patients had shorter healing periods compared to adults (P < 0.01). Chronic wounds (> four weeks old) were documented in both adult (n = 3) and pediatric (n = 2) wound repair publications; all chronic surgical wounds demonstrated complete wound closure with dHACM. No complications from dHACM use were reported. Advantages of dHACM included increased patient satisfaction, cost-savings, and faster wound healing. We then present two cases of myelomeningocele wound repair facilitated successfully by dHACM. Overall, dHACM proves to successfully expedite wound repair in pediatric patients with chronic or complicated wounds such as those from myelomeningocele repair. It is important for surgeons to consider wound duration, size, and patient age to better predict graft success in enhancing wound repair.","output":"Dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane allografts for myelomeningocele and wound reconstruction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral rehabilitation consists in diagnosing and treating the entire pathology in the oral cavity, in the joint, muscle, bone, by correcting changes caused by tooth loss, abrasions, dental malpositions or the removal of tumors from the face S ARS-COV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, the beta-coronavirus group In December 2019, a 2019-nCoV coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Wuhan, China, which causes severe pneumonia with high mortality;called coronaviruses, which are transmitted directly by the respiratory tract (by drops) or fecal / oral There is no one specific or preventive antiviral treatment (vaccine) in human coronavirus infections, the treatment being only symptomatic The pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus was initially detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province and then spread to three other provinces in China: Guangdong Sheng, Beijing Shi and Shanghai Shi Coronavirus is a group of zoonotic viruses that are part of the coronaviride family and can be transmitted from animal to human, some being asymptomatic and others very aggressive and invasive The symptoms of coronavirus are similar to those of flu and cold, but they become very aggressive, causing a type of pneumonia that can lead to death in people with low immunity, who have associated diseases, are elderly or in pregnant women A number of coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43) cause endemic mild respiratory conditions, in the group of common \\"colds\\" or \\"common respiratory viruses \\" Two other coronaviruses caused severe respiratory outbreaks These are: SARS-CoV and (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes, from a clinical point of view, a respiratory infection called COVID-19 (Coronavirus infectious disease - 2019)","output":"Oral Rehabilitation and Specific Protective Measures against Sars-voc 2 Infection in Dental Medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"College instructors faced a rapid transition to remote instruction in spring 2020, and with it a host of new teaching challenges.

We used semi-structured interviews and content analysis to identify instructor learning that is relevant beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants described two related insights about students: They became more aware that students' lives outside the classroom are complex, and they realized that their campus can act as a neutralizing space for students. Participants also reconsidered how they assess student learning. New realizations about students and teaching have the potential to impact teaching practices when in-person instruction resumes. Especially promising is an increased focus on students as individuals and the recognition that not all students experience life and courses in the same way.

METHODS: The protocol was published in Open Science Framework. We used the PECOS framework to frame the review question. Studies published between January 1, 2000, and January 4, 2021, from North America, Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand were systematically identified and screened through searching electronic databases, citations, and by contacting experts. Risk of bias assessments were performed. Data were synthesized using the lumping technique. RESULTS: Overall, 6512 records were screened and 38 were selected for inclusion. 37 of the 38 studies included in this review show a connection between at least one aspect of mental disorder and opioid overdose. The largest body of evidence exists for internalizing disorders generally and mood disorders specifically, followed by anxiety disorders, although there is also moderate evidence to support the relationship between thought disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and opioid overdose. Moderate evidence also was found for the association between any disorder and overdose. CONCLUSION: Nearly all reviewed studies found a connection between mental disorder and overdose, and the evidence suggests that having mental disorder is associated with experiencing fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose, but causal direction remains unclear.","output":"Mental disorder and opioid overdose: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is an essential task to discuss the death cases for clinicians. During the emergent public events, the report and analysis of death cases is of far-reaching significance.

Given that the relevant systems need to be improved, and that the integration of standardized reports and clinical research is not mature,as well as other problems, we put forward several methodological suggestions: a? Establish national medical and health data center and improve relevant laws and regulations. a?? Increase investment in medical data management and start data collection and analysis as early as possible during the epidemic. a? Refine the content of death case report and promote the standardization of report. a? Pay close attention to the report of death cases, review, summary and analysis.

Viral load was derived from standardised RT-qPCR Cycle threshold (C(t)) values. The data collection period ranged from November 12, 2020 to February 28, 2021. Findings: The sensitivity of RDT compared to RT-qPCR was 4257% (95% CI 3338%C5231%). The specificity was 9968% (95% CI 9948%C9980%). Sensitivity declined with decreasing viral load from 100% in samples with a deduced viral load of 10(8) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml to 882% in samples with a viral load lower than 10(4) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per ml. No significant differences in sensitivity or specificity could be observed between samples with and without spike protein variant B.1.1.7. The NPV in the study cohort was 9884%; the PPV in persons with typical COVID-19 symptoms was 9737%, and 2857% in persons without or with atypical symptoms. Interpretation: RDT are a reliable method to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons with high viral load.

Commonly used medications for chronic conditions, e.g., diuretics, antipsychotics disrupt thermoregulation or fluid/electrolyte balance and may sensitive patients to heat. However, the effect of heat-sensitizing medications and their interactions with heatwaves are not well-quantified. We evaluated effects of potentially heat-sensitizing medications in vulnerable older patients. METHODS: US Medicare data were linked at the zip code level to climate data with surface air temperatures for June-August of 2007C2012. Patients were Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years with chronic conditions including diabetes, dementia, and cardiovascular, lung, or kidney disease. Exposures were potentially heat-sensitizing medications including diuretics, anticholinergics, antipsychotics, beta blockers, stimulants, and anti-hypertensives. A heatwave was defined as 2 days above the 95(th) percentile of historical zip code-specific surface air temperatures. We estimated associations of heat-sensitizing medications and heatwaves with heat-related hospitalization using self-controlled case series analysis. RESULTS: We identified 9,721 patients with at least one chronic condition and heat-related hospitalization; 42.1% of these patients experienced a heatwave. Heatwaves were associated with an increase in heat-related hospitalizations ranging from 21% (95% CI: 7% to 38%) to 33% (95% CI: 14% to 55%) across medication classes. Several drug classes were associated with moderately elevated risk of heat-related hospitalization in the absence of heatwaves, with rate ratios ranging from 1.16 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.35) to 1.37 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.66). We did not observe meaningful synergistic interactions between heatwaves and medications. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with chronic conditions may be at heightened risk for heat-related hospitalization due to the use of heat-sensitizing medications throughout the summer months, even in the absence of heatwaves. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and also to understand the effect of milder and shorter heat exposure.","output":"Heatwaves, medications, and heat-related hospitalization in older Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The availability of standardized guidelines regarding the use of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in clinical practice has not effectively helped to solve the main drawbacks of fetal heart rate (FHR) surveillance methodology, which still presents inter- and intra-observer variability as well as uncertainty in the classification of unreassuring or risky FHR recordings.

Mechanistic models that capture the dynamics of such dependent happenings are a fundamental tool of infectious disease epidemiology.

Increasing use of models to inform practical public health decision making has challenged the field to develop new methods to exploit available data and appropriately characterize the uncertainty in the results. Here, we discuss recent advances and areas of active research in the mechanistic and dynamic modeling of infectious disease. We highlight how a growing emphasis on data and inference, novel forecasting methods, and increasing access to big data are changing the field of infectious disease dynamics. We showcase the application of these methods in phylodynamic research, which combines mechanistic models with rich sources of molecular data to tie genetic data to population-level disease dynamics. As dynamics and mechanistic modeling methods mature and are increasingly tied to principled statistical approaches, the historic separation between the infectious disease dynamics and traditional epidemiologic methods is beginning to erode; this presents new opportunities for cross pollination between fields and novel applications.","output":"Trends in the Mechanistic and Dynamic Modeling of Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forced German universities to adjust their established operations quickly during the first nationwide lockdown in spring 2020.

Additionally, the students reported the direction of changes in key study characteristics they expected from this new situation. Moreover, they reported the extent to which they believe they will be able to master this new study situation successfully. Two categories of independent variables were considered: context-related variables and person-related variables. Our results show that students did not have many learning opportunities to promote their digital literacy, suggesting that they were not appropriately prepared for this new situation. Results for digital literacy vary by competence area. However, there is a positive correlation between past formal learning opportunities and corresponding digital competences. Master students reported more learning opportunities and higher digital literacy only in one competence area compared to bachelor students. Regarding the expected change of key study characteristics, some characteristics were expected to worsen and fewer to improve. A multiple regression analysis explained 54% of the estimated probability of successful remote learning. Students age, state anxiety, positive state affect, general self-efficacy, the availability of an own workplace, past learning opportunities in digital content creation, and the estimated preparedness of lecturers for remote teaching were significant explaining factors.

These help to efficiently monitor CPS infrastructure-avoiding routing oscillation, while improving its safety. The contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, a CPS orchestration model is proposed that relies upon: (i) Inbound surveillance and outbound actuation to improve dependability and (ii) a novel information diffusion model that uses epidemic states and diffusion sets to produce diffusion patterns across the CPS-IoT. Secondly, the proposed CPS orchestration model is numerically analysed to show its dependability for both sensitive and non-sensitive applications. Finally, a novel interference-aware clustering protocol called \\"INMP\\", which enables network reconfiguration through migration of nodes across clusters, is proposed.

Via online questionnaires, an evaluation was performed on their depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms on the DASS-21 scale. Teachers sociodemographic and socio-personal data were also analyzed. A binary logistic regression was used to analyze the variables which could be associated with each of the symptoms. High rates of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were observed among teachers (67%, 73%, and 86%, respectively). Among teachers who were affected by the workCfamily balance (89%), there was also an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety (OR: 3.2) and stress (OR: 3.5). Depression symptom risk was higher among women (OR: 2.2), and teachers under 35 years old had a risk of presenting all three symptoms (depression OR: 2.2; anxiety OR: 4.0; stress OR 3.0).

We aimed to characterize a large-animal model for studying the \\"Small-for-Flow\\" syndrome. METHODS We performed subtotal (90%) hepatectomies in 10 female MiniPigs using a simplified transection technique with a tourniquet. Blood tests, hepatic and systemic hemodynamics, and hepatic function and histology were assessed before (Bas), 15 min (t-15 min) and 24 h (t-24 h) after the operation. Some pigs underwent computed tomography (CT) scans for hepatic volumetry (n = 4) and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (n = 3). Postoperative care was performed in an intensive care unit environment. RESULTS All hepatectomies were successfully performed, and hepatic volumetry confirmed liver remnant volumes of 9.2% [6.2-11.2]. The hepatectomy resulted in characteristic hepatic hemodynamic alterations, including portal hyperperfusion, relative decrease of hepatic arterial blood flow, and increased portal pressure (PP) and portal-systemic pressure gradient. The model reproduced major diagnostic features including the development of cholestasis, coagulopathy, encephalopathy with increased ICP, ascites, and renal failure, hyperdynamic circulation, and hyperlactatemia. Two animals (20%) died before t-24 h. Histological liver damage was observed at t-15 min and at t-24 h. The degree of histological damage at t-24 h correlated with intraoperative PP (r = 0.689, p = 0.028), hepatic arterial blood flow (r = 0.655, p = 0.040), and hepatic arterial pulsatility index (r = 0.724, p = 0.066). All animals with intraoperative PP > 20 mmHg presented liver damage at t-24 h.

Increasing evidence also suggests that cancer-causing pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and human papilloma virus (HPV) may induce oncogenesis by disrupting cell polarity. This is mainly achieved through their ability to deregulate the function of cell polarity components and/or regulators. Hence cell polarity represents the first line of defence against infection. Interestingly, EGFR/RAS oncogenic signals also induce cancer cell invasion by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Since the loss of cell polarity is a prerequisition of EMT, cell polarity also represents the last line of defence against cancer cell invasion. As such we argue that cell polarity may be a key defence mechanism against infection and cancer cell invasion. The potential role of cell polarity as a gatekeeper against cancer through its ability to regulate asymmetric cell division and tumour suppression has been discussed in a number of recent reviews. In this review we will focus on the role of cell polarity as a potential target of infection and cancer cell invasion.","output":"Cell Polarity: A Key Defence Mechanism Against Infection and Cancer Cell Invasion?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared subgroup differences in COVID-19 case and mortality and investigated factors associated with case and mortality rate (MR) measured at the county level in Mississippi.

Whilst myocardial involvement in hospitalized patients has been extensively described in literature, no data are currently available for non-hospitalized individuals. Present study aimed to explore prevalence and impact on patients management of myocardial damage detected with CMR, in a cohort of consecutive non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infection patients. Methods and results We conducted a single centre prospective observational study on 31 consecutive patients with previous COVID-19 who underwent CMR between October 2020 and June 2021 without requiring hospital admission. Myocarditis was defined by CMR according to the revised Lake Louise Criteria (LLC), if at least one criterion was positive: T2-based marker for myocardial oedema and T1-based marker for associated myocardial injury. Our patients cohort included 31 individuals with a mean age of 42.5  17.4 years (20 males;64.5%) with mean follow-up time of 365.8  89 days between first positive PCR and last clinical evaluation. CMR evidence of cardiac involvement was observed in six patients (19.3%)including two acute (of which one with pericardial inflammation), one subacute and three healed myocarditis. CMR abnormalities were associated with a higher percentage of palpitations (83% vs. 24%, P = 0.013) and chest pain (66% vs. 16%, P = 0.026) during the active phase of COVID-19. In all CMR positive cases, a tailored therapeutic approach was established consisting with the administration of cardioactive therapy with beta-blockers. All cases were uneventful during the follow-up period. Conclusions Our data showed a 19.3% prevalence of unexpected/subclinical myocardial involvement in a cohort of 31 consecutive non-hospitalized patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. CMR findings were retrospectively associated with cardiac symptoms during the acute phase and yielded a change in clinical and therapeutic management in all positive cases. A better knowledge of symptomatic course of COVID-19 could help physicians to adequately select individuals in which CMR may show signs of cardiac damage.","output":"CMR prevalence of subclinical myocardial damage in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients: are we looking for a needle in a haystack?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 and the Movement Control Order (MCO) may trigger a next wave of mental health problems.

Inaccessible by widespread commercial techniques, the mass of single nanoparticles and viruses (>10MDa) can be readily measured by NEMS (Nanoelectromechanical Systems) based Mass Spectrometry, where charged and isolated analyte particles are generated by Electrospray Ionization (ESI) in air and transported onto the NEMS resonator for capture and detection. However, the applicability of NEMS as a practical solution is hindered by their miniscule surface area, which results in poor limit-of-detection and low capture efficiency values. Another hindrance is the necessity to house the NEMS inside complex vacuum systems, which is required in part to focus analytes towards the miniscule detection surface of the NEMS. Here, we overcome both limitations by integrating an ion lens onto the NEMS chip. The ion lens is composed of a polymer layer, which charges up by receiving part of the ions incoming from the ESI tip and consequently starts to focus the analytes towards an open window aligned with the active area of the NEMS electrostatically. With this integrated system, we have detected the mass of gold and polystyrene nanoparticles under ambient conditions and with two orders-of-magnitude improvement in capture efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art. We then applied this technology to obtain the mass spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and BoHV-1 virions. With the increase in analytical throughput, the simplicity of the overall setup and the operation capability under ambient conditions, the technique demonstrates that NEMS Mass Spectrometry can be deployed for mass detection of engineered nanoparticles and biological samples efficiently.","output":"Atmospheric Pressure Mass Spectrometry of Single Viruses and Nanoparticles by Nanoelectromechanical Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between telemedicine utilization and sociodemographic factors among patients seeking eye care.

METHODS: We reviewed the eye care utilization patterns of a stratified random sample of 1,720 patients who were seen at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 30 to May 25, 2020). The odds of having a video, phone or in-person visit compared to having a deferred visit. Associations between independent variables and visit type were determined using a multinomial logistic regression model. RESULTS: Older patients had lower odds of having a video visit (p=0.007) and higher odds of having an in-person visit (p=0.023) compared to being deferred, and in the non-retina clinic sample, older patients still had a lower odds of a video visit (p-0.02).

Covid-19 is an excellent stress test for every entity, as for micro-companies, so for the largest multinational corporations. Nowadays, in the era of the world Covid-19 pandemic, companies challenge to maintain business operations and going concern assumption. However, in every crisis or adverse situation, some companies take enormous benefits of it. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be characterized as the major players during this last, still actual crisis. Their role can be observed from two angles, first as a provider of necessary drugs for curing Covid-19 patients and from the other side, as a developer of effective and efficient vaccine which will 'save the world' and brought us back to the 'old normal'.

METHODS: Ten patients were included after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in NPS samples according to the National Institute of Infectious Disease guidelines. In comparison with this conventional diagnostic method, NPS/NS/SS samples were tested using the cobas 6800 systems RT-PCR device. To investigate the usefulness of the cobas method and the difference among sample types, the agreement and sensitivity were calculated. Five to six samples were collected over a total period of 5C6 d from each patient. RESULTS: Fifty-seven sets of NPS/NS/SS samples were collected, of which 40 tested positive for COVID-19 by the conventional method. Overall, the concordance rates using the conventional method were 86.0%/70.2%/54.4% for NPS/NS/SS samples (cobas); however, for samples collected up to and including on Day 9 after disease onset (22 negative and one positive specimens), the corresponding rates were 95.7%/87.0%/65.2%.

CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admissions for AIS decreased in the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly during months of higher incidences of new COVID-19 cases. When the incidence of admissions diminished, an increase in the severity of AIS was observed, characterized by larger areas. These findings might contribute to other similar referral centers in managing public policies related to stroke.","output":"Acute ischemic stroke and COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: a comparative study of frequency and risk factors before and during SARS-CoV-2 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The host innate immune system develops various strategies to antagonize virus infection, and the pathogen subverts or evades host innate immunity for self-replication. In the present study, we discovered that Avibirnavirus infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) VP3 protein significantly inhibits MDA5-induced beta interferon (IFN-) expression by blocking IRF3 activation. Binding domain mapping showed that the CC1 domain of VP3 and the residue lysine-155 of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) are essential for the interaction. Furthermore, we found that the CC1 domain was required for VP3 to downregulate MDA5-mediated IFN- production. A ubiquitination assay showed that lysine-155 of TRAF3 was the critical residue for K33-linked polyubiquitination, which contributes to the formation of a TRAF3-TBK1 complex. Subsequently, we revealed that VP3 blocked TRAF3-TBK1 complex formation through reducing K33-linked polyubiquitination of lysine-155 on TRAF3. Taken together, our data reveal that VP3 inhibits MDA5-dependent IRF3-mediated signaling via blocking TRAF3-TBK1 complex formation, which improves our understanding of the interplay between RNA virus infection and the innate host antiviral immune response. IMPORTANCE Type I interferon plays a critical role in the host response against virus infection, including Avibirnavirus. However, many viruses have developed multiple strategies to antagonize the innate host antiviral immune response during coevolution with the host. In this study, we first identified that K33-linked polyubiquitination of lysine-155 of TRAF3 enhances the interaction with TBK1, which positively regulates the host IFN immune response. Meanwhile, we discovered that the interaction of the CC1 domain of the Avibirnavirus VP3 protein and the residue lysine-155 of TRAF3 reduced the K33-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 and blocked the formation of the TRAF3-TBK1 complex, which contributed to the downregulation of host IFN signaling, supporting viral replication.","output":"Inhibition of Antiviral Innate Immunity by Avibirnavirus VP3 via Blocking TBK1-TRAF3 Complex Formation and IRF3 Activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant morbidity and mortality globally.

Infection is associated with the development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity, which can protect against infection in animal models1,2. Antibody levels decrease with time, but, to our knowledge, the nature and quality of the memory B cells that would be required to produce antibodies upon reinfection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection with SARS-CoV-2. We find that titres of IgM and IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 decrease significantly over this time period, with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by fivefold in pseudotype virus assays. By contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remains unchanged at 6.2 months after infection. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies that they express have greater somatic hypermutation, resistance to RBD mutations and increased potency, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Immunofluorescence and PCR analyses of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals at 4 months after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) revealed the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 individuals.

Here, we used all-atom classical Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the stability of the reference interface for three complexes that previously served as targets in the CAPRI competition. For each one of these targets, we also ran MD simulations for ten models that are distributed over the High, Medium and Acceptable accuracy categories. To assess the quality of these models from a dynamic perspective, we set up new criteria which take into account the stability of the reference experimental protein interface. We show that, when the protein interfaces are allowed to evolve along time, the original ranking based on the static CAPRI criteria no longer holds as over 50% of the docking models undergo a category change (which can be either toward a better or a lower accuracy group) when reassessing their quality using dynamic information.","output":"Moving pictures: Reassessing docking experiments with a dynamic view of protein interfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To better understand motivations behind purchase and storage of firearms during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used Amazon Mechanical Turk to conduct an online survey of individuals who did and did not purchase a firearm since 1 January 2020 in response to COVID-19.

METHODS: An observational multicenter study investigating the causes of emergency department visits and hospital admissions within 10 days of COVID\\\\19 vaccination. Patients who received first or second doses of COVID\\\\19 vaccines and presented to the emergency department (ED), as well as those admitted to the hospitals or intensive care units (ICUs) were included. Causes of ED, hospital, and ICU admissions and discharges were collected based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\\\\10) coding system. RESULTS: Between December 2020 and March 2021, 1842 patients visited the ED within 10 days of COVID\\\\19 vaccine administration. The mean age was 70.3 years. Overall, 1221 patients presented after the first dose of the vaccine and 653 after the second dose.

This, in turn, prompting the desperate need for devising fast, cheap and accurate tools via which the disease can be diagnosed in its early stage. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) test is the mainstay tool used to detect the COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the high false-negative rate of this test, physicians usually use chest radiographs as an adjunct or alternative tool. Although radiographs screening is wide-available, low-cost, and its results are timely, relying on radiologists to interpret them manually stands against using radiographs as a diagnostic tool.

Secondly, a 1-dimensional CNN (1DCNN) to extract the medical knowledge presented in the metadata. By this integration, PCN2 can make perfect classifications even for those cases in which the infection signs in radiographs are unclear due to being the disease in early-stage, confounded by other markers or overlapped by other diseases.

Two novel measures of cognition (No Practice Effects (NPE) cognitive battery and Miami Computerized Functional Assessment Scale (CFAS)) were designed to have robust psychometric properties and reduced practice and ceiling effects. This study aims to evaluate if the NPE and CFAS demonstrate stronger psychometric properties and reduced practice effects compared with established measures, including the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). METHODS This parallel group, four-site study will randomize 320 cognitively intact adults aged 60 to 85 years to novel or well-established measures of cognition and function. All participants will receive assessments at baseline (week 0), week 12, and week 52, as well as a brain MRI scan and Apolipoprotein E genetic test at study entry. Analyses will determine psychometric properties of the NPE and CFAS, compare the sensitivity of measures to AD risk markers, and identify cognitive domains within the NPE. DISCUSSION Practice effects have been a major limitation of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials that typically assess cognitive changes over serial assessments. Detection of functional impairment in cognitively normal individuals with biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease requires instruments sensitive to very subtle functional changes. This study is intended to support the validation of two new composite measures, the NPE battery and the CFAS, which may advance clinical testing of interventions for individuals across the spectrum of early stage Alzheimer's disease.

Early administration of coagulation factors improves post-traumatic coagulation disorders, and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) might be useful in this context. Our main hypothesis is that four-factor PCC in addition to a massive transfusion protocol decreases blood product consumption at day 1 in severe trauma patients with major bleeding. METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel, controlled superiority trial. Eligible patients are trauma patients with major bleeding admitted to a French level-I trauma center. Patients randomized in the treatment arm receive 1 mL/kg (25 IU/ml of Factor IX/Kg) four-factor PCC within 1-h post-admission while patients randomized in the controlled group receive 1 mL/kg of saline solution 0.9% as a placebo. Treatments are given as soon as possible using syringe pumps (120 mL/h). The primary endpoint is the amount of blood products transfused in the first 24 h post-admission (including red blood cells, frozen fresh plasma, and platelets). The secondary endpoints are the amount of each blood product transfused in the first 24 h, time to achieve prothrombin time ratio < 1.5, time to hemostasis, number of thrombo-embolic events at 28 days, mortality at 24 h and 28 days, number of intensive care unit-free days, number of ventilator-free days, number of hospital-free days within the first 28 days, hospitalization status at day 28, Glasgow outcome scale extended for patients with brain lesions on initial cerebral imaging, and cost of each strategy at days 8 and 28. Inclusions have started in December 2017 and are expected to be complete by June 2021. DISCUSSION: If PCC reduces total blood consumption at day 1 after severe trauma, this therapy, in adjunction to a classic massive transfusion protocol, may be used empirically on admission in patients at risk of massive transfusion to enhance coagulation. Moreover, this treatment may decrease blood product-related complications and may improve clinical outcomes after post-traumatic hemorrhage. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03218722.

This study aims to identify and evaluate the global trends in myopia research of the past century and visualize the frontiers using bibliometric analysis. METHODS: The literature search was conducted on the Web of Science for myopia studies published between 1900 and 2020. Retrieved publications were analyzed in-depth by the annual publication number, prolific countries and institutions, core author and journal, and the number of citations through descriptive statistics. Collaboration networks and keywords burst were visualized by VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Myopia citation network was visualized using CitNetExplorer. RESULTS: In total, 11,172 publications on myopia were retrieved from 1900 to 2020, with most published by the United States. Saw SM, from the National University of Singapore, contributed the most publications and citations. Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science was the journal with highest number of citations. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery with the maximum number of publications. The top 10 cited papers mainly focused on the epidemiology of myopia. Previous research emphasized myopia-associated experimental animal models, while recent keywords include SMILE and myopia control with the stronger burst, indicating a shift of concern from etiology to therapy and coincided with the global increment of incidence. Document citation network was clustered into six groups: prevalence and risk factors of myopia, surgical control of myopia, pathogenesis of myopia, optical interventions of myopia, myopia and glaucoma, and pathological myopia.

Most previous research has explored student preferences with respect to specific courses or at the institutional level, but the present study examines students' preferences with respect to their discipline: arts, science and technology, business, hospitality and mathematics. Analyses revealed that students prefer conventional lectures providing that recordings are made available online, but that students prefer small group teaching, collaborative work, assessment, support and other activities to be delivered conventionally. These preferences were broadly similar across students drawn from the different discipline areas, but there was also some variation between the disciplines.

To determine the optimum values of hyperparameters for MFCCs and classifiers, the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) strategy was implemented.

Brain pericytes in the peri-infarct area express macrophage markers in response to injury stimuli and are involved in neovascularization. In the kidney, nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2)+ pericytes have been found to accumulate after renal injury. These accumulated NG2+ cells are not involved in scar formation. However, the role of accumulated NG2+ cells in injured kidneys remains unknown. Here, using a reversible ischemic reperfusion model, we found that renal NG2+ cells were increased in injured kidneys and expressed macrophage markers (CD11b or F4/80) on day 3 after reperfusion. Isolated NG2+ cells from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) kidneys also had phagocytic activity and expressed anti-inflammatory cytokine genes, including mannose receptor and IL-10. These macrophage-like NG2+ cells did not likely differentiate into myofibroblasts because they did not increase -SMA expression. Intravenous transfusion of renal NG2+ cells isolated from donor mice on day 3 after reperfusion into recipient mice on day 1 after I/R surgery revealed that NG2+ cell-injected mice had lower plasma blood urea nitrogen, reduced KIM-1 mRNA expression, ameliorated renal damage, and reduced cellular debris accumulation than PBS-injected mice on day 5 after reperfusion.

DESIGN: retrospective cohort study with an individual level record linkage procedure of different administrative databases. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the cohort included 3,010 patients residing in FVG who tested positive for COVID-19 between 1 March and 15 May 2020, 2020. Regional hospital admissions and deaths without hospital admissions up to June 1st, 2020 were analysed. Determinants of the probability of a highly severe illness were investigated in terms of hospitalisations or death without hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 patients were identified from regional epidemiological data warehouse. Demographical and clinical variables such as gender, age, patient's comorbidities, vaccinations, ARBs/sartans prescriptions, and geographical residence variables were collected by linking different databases. Descriptive analyses were performed. Logistic multivariate regressions were used to estimate the probability of hospitalisation or death, whichever came first. Model coefficients and odds ratios (OR) were reported. RESULTS: COVID-19 population in FVG had a mean age of 60 years and 59% were females. The study found that 37% had hypertension while patients with cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and cancer were around 15%; 22% of the cases were residing in retirement homes. Approximately 30% received flu or pneumococcal vaccination and a similar proportion of patients had at least one prescription of ARBs /sartans in the previous 6 months. Statistical models showed a higher probability of a worst course of disease for males, elderly, highly complicated (in terms of resource use) subjects, in the presence of cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and pneumococcal vaccination. People living in retirement homes had a lower probability of hospitalisation/death without hospital admission. The cohort was divided into two groups: COVID-19 patients infected in the territory and infected in retirement homes. Among COVID-19 patients infected in the territory, the probability of hospitalisation/death was higher for males, for older individuals, and for those with comorbidities. Diabetes resulted to be a risk factor (OR 1.79; 95%CI 1.23-2.62), as well as pneumococcal vaccination (OR 1.64; 95%CI: 1.18-2.29), which is a likely proxy of fragile patients with pulmonary disease. The flu vaccination showed a potential protective effect with a 40% lower probability of hospitalisation or death (OR 0.62; 95%CI 0.44-0.85). Among the retirement homes cohort group, a higher probability of a bad course of disease emerged for males and for more complex patients. CONCLUSIONS: the greatest risk of hospitalisation/death as a measure of more severe illness was confirmed for males, elderly, and for individuals with comorbidities. Flu vaccination seemed to have had a protective effect while pneumococcal vaccination likely identified a group of high-risk patients to be actively monitored. For patients infected in the territory, different hospitalisation strategies were implemented by the regional health districts.","output":"Clinical, demographical characteristics and hospitalisation of 3,010 patients with Covid-19 in Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (Northern Italy).

Annually, Botswana accounts only for a small proportion of cases (<<1%). Despite significantly reduced incidence rate, the country still experiences sporadic outbreaks that hamper the goal of malaria elimination. This review evaluated previous and current biological factors that impact malaria in Botswana, specifically focussing on the vectors, the parasite and the host. This was accomplished via a literature review evaluating these variables in Botswana. Current literature suggests that Anopheles arabiensis is the main malaria vector in the country. Several other potential vectors have been found widely distributed throughout Botswana in high numbers, yet remain largely unstudied with regards to their contribution to the country's malaria burden. We also report the most up to date list of all Anopheles species that have been found in Botswana. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of symptomatic malaria in the country and some drug resistance markers have been documented for this species. Plasmodium vivax has been reported in asymptomatic subjects, even though a large proportion of the Botswana population appears to be Duffy antigen negative. Very little is known about the true distribution of P. vivax and no point of care testing infrastructure for this species exists in Botswana, making it difficult to tailor treatment to address possible recrudescence or relapse. Due to a genetically diverse population with a substantial Khoisan contribution into the Bantu genetic background, several phenotypes that potentially impact prevalence and severity of malaria exist within the country. These include sickle cell trait, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, and Duffy negativity. This review highlights the information that currently exists on malaria in Botswana.

Methods: A comprehensive literature and patent search review was undertaken using PubMed, as well as Google Scholar and Espacenet search engines to review these areas. Conclusions: In the bloodstream, EchA can mediate cellular responses, act as a radical scavenger, and activate the glutathione pathway. It decreases ROS imbalance, prevents and limits lipid peroxidation, and enhances mitochondrial functions. Most importantly, EchA contributes to the modulation of the immune system. EchA can regulate the generation of regulatory T cells, inhibit pro-inflammatory IL-1 and IL-6 cytokine production, while slightly reducing IL-8, TNF-, INF-, and NKT, thus correcting immune imbalance.

METHODS: We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. RESULTS: A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p = 0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19.

In this study, the structure of IBDV SVP was determined in a cubic crystal and refined to 2.6A resolution. It contains 20 independent VP2 subunits in a crystallographic asymmetric unit. Each subunit is folded mainly into a shell domain and a protrusion domain, both with the Swiss-roll topology, plus a small helical base domain. Three VP2 subunits constitute a tight trimer, which is the building block of IBDV (sub)viral particles. The structure revealed a calcium ion bound to three pairs of symmetry-related Asp31 and Asp174 to stabilize the VP2 trimer. Our results of treatment of SVP with EGTA, a Ca(2+)-chelating reagent, indicated that the metal-ion may be important not only in maintaining highly stable quaternary structure but also in regulating the swelling and dissociation of the icosahedral particles. A Ca(2+)-dependent assembly pathway was thus proposed, which involves further interactions between the trimers. The 20 independent subunits showed conformational variations, with the surface loops of the protrusion domain being the most diverse. These loops are targets of the neutralizing antibodies. Several common interactions between the surface loops were clearly observed, suggesting a possible major conformation of the immunogenic epitopes.","output":"Crystal structure of infectious bursal disease virus VP2 subviral particle at 2.6A resolution: implications in virion assembly and immunogenicity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Occlusion balloon catheters of 5.2- or 6-French have been used for a few decades in various endovascular treatments of body trunk vascular lesions.

GPR171 is a promising therapeutic target that is widely expressed through the brain, including within the descending pain modulatory regions. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of the GPR171 agonist, MS15203, in its ability to alleviate chronic pain in male and female mice using a once-daily systemic dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.) of MS15203 over the course of 5 days. We found that in our models of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), MS15203 did not alleviate thermal hypersensitivity and allodynia, respectively, in female mice. On the other hand, MS15203 treatment decreased the duration of thermal hypersensitivity in CFA-treated male mice following 3 days of once-daily administration. MS15203 treatment also produced an improvement in allodynia in male mice, but not female mice, in neuropathic pain after 5 days of treatment. Gene expression of GPR171 and that of its endogenous ligand BigLEN, encoded by the gene PCSK1N, were unaltered within the periaqueductal gray (PAG) in both male and female mice following inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, following neuropathic pain in male mice, the protein levels of GPR171 were decreased in the PAG. Treatment with MS15203 then rescued the protein levels of GPR171 in the PAG of these mice. Taken together, our results identify GPR171 as a GPCR that displays sexual dimorphism in alleviation of chronic pain. Further, our results suggest that GPR171 and MS15203 have demonstrable therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic pain.","output":"GPR171 Agonist Reduces Chronic Neuropathic and Inflammatory Pain in Male, But Not Female Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most currently approved strategies for the collection of saliva for COVID-19 diagnostics require specialized tubes containing buffers promoted for the stabilization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and virus inactivation. Yet many of these are expensive, in limited supply, and not necessarily validated specifically for viral RNA. While saliva is a promising sample type as it can be reliably self-collected for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, the expense and availability of these collection tubes are prohibitive to mass testing efforts. Therefore, we investigated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious virus detection from saliva without supplementation. We tested RNA stability over extended periods of time (2-25 days) and at temperatures representing at-home storage and elevated temperatures which might be experienced when cold chain transport may be unavailable. We found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva from infected individuals is stable at 4C, room temperature (~19C), and 30C for prolonged periods and found limited evidence for viral replication in stored saliva samples. This work demonstrates that expensive saliva collection options involving RNA stabilization and virus inactivation buffers are not always needed, permitting the use of cheaper collection options. Affordable testing methods are urgently needed to meet current testing demands and for continued surveillance in reopening strategies.","output":"Simply saliva: stability of SARS-CoV-2 detection negates the need for expensive collection devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The causative agent of COVID\\\\19 is a novel member of coronaviridaes, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2.

These measures-among which social distancing and contact restrictions were most prominent-may have an overall effect on people's psychological well-being. The present study seeks to examine whether lockdown measures affected people's well-being; anxiety; depressive symptoms during the lockdown and whether these effects could be explained by reduced satisfaction of the basic psychological needs of autonomy and relatedness. N = 1086 participants of different ages and educational levels from all over Germany reported strong declines in autonomy and well-being; small declines in relatedness satisfaction; moderate increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms. These effects were stronger for people with moderate to bad subjective overall health. Latent change modeling revealed that, especially, decreases in autonomy satisfaction led to stronger decreases in well-being as well as stronger increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms; whereas decreases in relatedness had much weaker effects. Our results imply differential effects depending on individual preconditions; but also more generally that peoples' need for autonomy was most strongly affected by the lockdown measures, which should be considered as important information in planning future lockdowns.","output":"Psychological Impact of Corona Lockdown in Germany: Changes in Need Satisfaction, Well-Being, Anxiety, and Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to professional and personal lives of oncology professionals globally. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Resilience Task Force collaboration aimed to provide contemporaneous reports on the impact of COVID-19 on the lived experiences and well-being in oncology. METHODS: This online anonymous survey (July-August 2020) is the second of a series of global surveys launched during the course of the pandemic. Longitudinal key outcome measures including well-being/distress (expanded Well-being Index9 items), burnout (1 item from expanded Well-being Index), and job performance since COVID-19 were tracked. RESULTS: A total of 942 participants from 99 countries were included for final analysis: 58% (n = 544) from Europe, 52% (n = 485) female, 43% (n = 409) 40 years old, and 36% (n = 343) of non-white ethnicity. In July/August 2020, 60% (n = 525) continued to report a change in professional duties compared with the pre-COVID-19 era. The proportion of participants at risk of poor well-being (33%, n = 310) and who reported feeling burnout (49%, n = 460) had increased significantly compared with April/May 2020 (25% and 38%, respectively; P < 0.001), despite improved job performance since COVID-19 (34% versus 51%; P < 0.001). Of those who had been tested for COVID-19, 8% (n = 39/484) tested positive; 18% (n = 7/39) felt they had not been given adequate time to recover before return to work. Since the pandemic, 39% (n = 353/908) had expressed concerns that COVID-19 would have a negative impact on their career development or training and 40% (n = 366/917) felt that their job security had been compromised. More than two-thirds (n = 608/879) revealed that COVID-19 has changed their outlook on their work-personal life balance. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the well-being of oncology professionals globally, with significantly more in distress and feeling burnout compared with the first wave. Collective efforts from both national and international communities addressing support and coping strategies will be crucial as we recover from the COVID-19 crisis. In particular, an action plan should also be devised to tackle concerns raised regarding the negative impact of COVID-19 on career development, training, and job security.","output":"The concerns of oncology professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from the ESMO Resilience Task Force survey II"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study focuses on understanding the factors that affect the intention of using financial technology among young Vietnamese in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

These are expected to differ significantly from the situation in developing countries. We have reviewed factors that can affect the user's intention, including the Perceived Benefit (PB), Perceived Risk (PR), Belief (B), and Social Influence (SI), and rely on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) model in this research. The survey sample comprises 161 Z-generation consumers with strong flexibility and knowledge about the use of Fintech. We use the PLS-SEM (partial least squares structural equation modeling) analysis method with the SmartPLS software (SmartPLS GmbH, Oststeinbek, Germany) to evaluate the research model. We find that the Perceived Benefit (PB) has the most significant impact on the intention to use Fintech, followed by Belief (B). However, in general, the factors are not significant, perhaps due to many reasons that are intrinsic in Vietnam.

METHODS: Multi-centric retrospective case-control study conducted from October 2020 to May 2021. Cases comprised of consecutive patients of COVID-19-associated ROCM (CA-ROCM) presenting at the participating ophthalmic institutes. Controls comprised of COVID-19-positive or COVID-19-recovered patients who did not develop ROCM. Comparative analysis of demographic, COVID-19 infection, treatment parameters and vaccination status between cases and controls performed. Clinical and imaging features of CA-ROCM analyzed. RESULTS: There were 179 cases and 361 controls. Mean age of presentation in cases was 52.06 years (p = .001) with male predominance (69.83%, p = .000011). Active COVID-19 infection at the time of presentation of ROCM (57.54%, p < .0001), moderate to severe COVID-19 (p < .0001), steroid administration (OR 3.63, p < .00001), uncontrolled diabetes (OR 32.83, p < .00001), random blood sugar >178 mg/dl were associated with development of CA-ROCM.

Although several Chinese studies, describing the laboratory findings characteristics of this illness have been reported, European data are still scarce. Furthermore, previous studies often analyzed the averaged laboratory findings collected during the entire hospitalization period, whereas monitoring their time-dependent variations should give more reliable prognostic information. Methods We analyzed the time-dependent variations of 14 laboratory parameters in two groups of COVID-19 patients with, respectively, a positive (40 patients) or a poor (42 patients) outcome, admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). We focused mainly on laboratory parameters that are routinely tested, thus, prognostic information would be readily available even in low-resource settings. Results Statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed for most of the laboratory findings analyzed. We showed that some parameters can be considered as early prognostic indicators whereas others exhibit statistically significant differences only at a later stage of the disease. Among them, earliest indicators were: platelets, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, white blood cells and neutrophils. Conclusions This longitudinal study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first study describing the laboratory characteristics of Italian COVID-19 patients on a normalized time-scale.

This study argues that attention to the balance of autonomy and community is vital to successful language learning online. An initial exploration of recent scholarship on autonomy and community in learning languages online validates this approach to evaluating the situation. The specific phenomenon of online language teaching and learning during 2020 at the University of Melbourne is then presented as an autoethnographic case study and analyzed in the context of this research. In 2020, the author participated in online language learning experiences from several different perspectives. As Head of Languages, she led development of a new undergraduate certificate in languages in response to an Australian Federal Government initiative to offer significant subsidies for online language certificates in 2020. As a keen language learner, she enrolled in one of these certificates to study Italian. As a French lecturer, she converted Matters of Taste-French Eating Cultures, a highly interactive and sensory oriented on-campus subject for advanced French students, to online delivery.

A lot of smoke is produced in some hazardous workplaces, which is very easy to cause air pollution. Exposed to this condition for a long time, human health is also greatly endangered. Therefore, the online detection of air conditions in hazardous workplaces is of great significance. In this work, electric welding operation is taken as an example to study the air conditions in hazardous workplaces. The real-time detection of smoke generated from electric welding operation is carried out by Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The spectral line of lead is found in the smoke spectrum of lead tin wire. Some other metal elements are also detected in the smoke of the tin wire, such as Sn, Cu, Ca and K. Consequently, it is recommended to use lead-free tin wire. In addition, two welding scenarios are simulated. The results show that the generated smoke contains different element information with different welding objects. Then, the quantitative analysis of lead in smoke is carried out. It shows that the concentration of Pb can be calculated by the spectral line intensity in the spectrum. Finally, combined with the error back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), different kinds of smoke are classified, and the recognition accuracy is more than 99%, which proves that the combination of LIBS and BP-ANN is developed into an important method in the monitoring of different air pollutants.","output":"Online in situ detection of local air conditions in hazardous operation scenarios."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To perform a survey assessing the use of, attitudes towards, and perceived utility of social media (SoMe) in the 2021 urology residency match.

Identified challenges included: 1) high effort and time, 2) issues with sourcing references, and 3) challenging interactions with skeptics, editors, and students. Discussion Findings build on known benefits, such as providing a real-world collaborative project that contextualizes students learning experiences. They also echo known challenges, such as the resource-intensive nature of teaching with Wikipedia. At the same time, findings extend the current literature by revealing a potential opportunity to approach crowd-sourced information tools, like Wikipedia, as a vehicle to engage and enculturate HPE students within a situated learning context. These findings present implications for HPE programs considering implementing Wikipedia and faculty development needed to help instructors harness crowd-sourced information tools pedagogical opportunities as well as anticipate their challenges.","output":"Enculturating a Community of Action (CoA): A qualitative study of health professions educators perspectives on teaching with Wikipedia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to unfold, drastic changes in daily life pose significant challenges on mental and clinical health While public health interventions such as national lockdowns and social distancing are enforced to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the psychosocial and physical consequences have yet to be determined that may disproportionately affect people living with HIV (PLWH) Methods: To evaluate the impact of COVID-related stress on mental and clinical health, we conducted a 20-minute questionnaire eliciting sociodemographic information, clinical and psychological factors from people living in Miami, Fl All individuals &gt;18 years with or without a history of COVID-19 were included Participating PLWH were recruited from an existing HIV registry and HIV uninfected participants from community flyers and word of mouth Results: A total of 135 participants were recruited from 05/2020-06/2020 The mean age was 50 years old, 73/135 (54%) were female, and 102/135 (75%) were PLWH Among participating PLWH, 60/102 (58 8%) self-identified as African American, and 9/102 (8 8%) were positive for COVID-19 by a commercially approved test Among HIV-negative participants, 15/33 (45 5%) self-identified as White and 11/33 (33%) were positive for COVID-19 Both PLWH and HIVnegative participants described significant disruptions in health care access (47%), difficulty paying basic needs (41%), and feelings of anxiety and depression (48%);there was no statistically significant difference by HIV status However, HIV negative participants were less likely to experience job loss and income disruption compared to PLWH during the pandemic (70% for HIV-negative vs 48% for PLWH;OR 0 40, p=0 03) Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 on emotional and clinical health is significant in both PLWH and HIV-negative groups These findings highlight the need for providing mental and physical health care during the pandemic, especially for coping with stress and anxiety during these difficult times and ensuring adequate access to health care","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on psychosocial and clinical factors among people with and without HIV living in Miami"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic is a serious challenge for healthcare workers worldwide.

Thirty participants were administered a quantitative survey, followed by a semi-structured interview on partner notification, treatment, and expedited partner therapy (EPT). Among the 30 participants, 77% were female with a median age of 28 years (IQR = 24-36), 87% notified their partner, and 45% of partners requiring treatment received treatment. Partners who received a contact slip were more likely to have been treated than those who did not (75% vs. 25%). Contact slips were identified as facilitators of notification and treatment, while asymptomatic partners and limited clinic resources were identified as barriers to treatment. Few participants expressed a preference for EPT and concerns included preference for medical supervision, a belief their partner would refuse, and an inability to explain the treatment. Despite successful notification, partner treatment was modest within this population. Information for partners, provider counseling, and improved access to services may increase partner treatment.

Self-reported questionnaires concerning children's depression, loneliness, anxiety, and academic adjustment, and parents' coping with children's negative emotions were completed. The results suggested that compared with non-left-behind children, left-behind children's depression and anxiety symptoms were more severe and their academic adjustment was poorer. However, left-behind children had lower levels of loneliness than non-left-behind children. Additionally, supportive coping types, especially emotion-focused and problem-focused reactions, were significantly negatively correlated with children's depression and anxiety. Unsupportive coping types, especially distress and punitive reactions, were significantly positively correlated with children's depression and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, the relationships between punitive reactions and depression, ignoring and loneliness and problem-focused reactions and academic adjustment were significantly stronger in left-behind children. Hence, during the pandemic, left-behind children were still at a disadvantage even with their parents' company.

Cytokine storm and inflammatory responses have been introduced as the main causes of respiratory distress in severe cases. Moreover, all these inflammatory factors have been systematically expressed in the human body through chronic exposure to ambient pollution due to an industrial lifestyle and lead to respiratory problems . In order to assess the possible synergistic effect of air pollution on the increased severity of COVID-19, the number of days and the value of air quality index (AQI) as well as the amount of four ambient pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , O 3 , and NO 2 ) with unhealthy ranges were measured for three years in eight cities of Iran with different numbers of hospitalized patients affected with SARS-CoV-2. The correlation coefficient between the number of hospitalized patients and air pollution factors was calculated. The present data revealed a significant positive correlation between unhealthy ranges of O 3 and NO 2 and the number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. No correlation was found between PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and AQIs and the increased number of severe cases.

Early identification of patients with serious symptoms who may develop critical illness and even death is of considerable importance for personalizing treatment and balancing medical resources. Methods: : In this retrospective study, demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory tests from 726 patients with serious COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) were analyzed. The standards for the serious type are guided by the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19. Patients were classified into critical group (174 cases) and severe group (552 cases) based on whether the composite endpoint was reached, and the former group was divided into the survivors (47 cases) and non-survivors (127 cases). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to investigate the risk factors associated with poor prognosis and mortality outcomes. Results: : Male patients accounted for 62.1% and 51.6% in the critical group and severe group, with a median age of 68 and 65 years, respectively. Among critical cases there was a higher prevalence of chronic obstructive lung disease (p = 0.029) and chest distress (p = 0.040) than in severe cases. In the multivariable analysis, the risk factors associated with poor prognosis in severe cases were advanced age (p = 0.002), high respiratory rate (RR) (p < 0.0001), high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (p = 0.021), high hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) level (p < 0.0001), and low platelet counts (p = 0.005) at admission. In the adjusted models, higher mortality outcomes in critical patients were associated with high hs-cTnI level (p = 0.037). By plotting ROC curves of different indices, hs-cTnI and LDH were found to be predictive factors for poor prognosis in patients with severe COVID-19. Conclusions: : For the risk assessment of serious COVID-19 patients on admission, advanced age, high level of RR, LDH, hs-cTnI, and low platelet counts, constitute important risk factors for poor prognosis in severe cases, and the hs-cTnI level can be helpful in predicting fatal outcomes in critically ill patients.","output":"Cardiac Troponin I Associated with Poor Prognosis and Death Risk in 726 Severe and Critical COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 led to pandemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), manifesting with respiratory symptoms and multi-organ dysfunction.

Infection rates among employees are infrequently described. OBJECTIVE: To describe SARS-CoV-2 rates among SNF employees and residents during a non-outbreak time period, we measured cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across multiple sites in the Seattle area. DESIGN: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed for SNF employees and residents using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A subset of employees completed a sociodemographic and symptom questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Between March 29 and May 13, 2020, we tested 1583 employees and 1208 residents at 16 SNFs for SARS-CoV-2. MAIN MEASURE: SARS-CoV-2 testing results and symptom report among employees and residents. KEY RESULTS: Eleven of the 16 SNFs had one or more resident or employee test positive. Overall, 46 (2.9%) employees had positive or inconclusive testing for SARS-CoV-2, and among those who completed surveys, most were asymptomatic and involved in direct patient care. The majority of employees tested were female (934, 73%), and most employees were Asian (392, 30%), Black (360, 28%), or white (360, 28%). Among the 1208 residents tested, 110 (9.1%) had positive or inconclusive results. There was no association between the presence of positive residents and positive employees within a SNF (p = 0.62, McNemars test).

The first group included 51 patients without CVD, the second group included 55 patients with CVD .Patients in both groups underwent laboratory examination of blood samples at the time of hospitalization and 3 months after discharge from the hospital. Parameters of the erythroid series of the general blood test were assessed. Among inflammatory biomarkers, we examined the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and homocysteine. Initially all patients underwent computed tomography of the chest organs. Revealed what indicators of the erythroid series in the groups of patients with and without CVD had significant differences in a number of parameters: ESR; RDW-SD and RDW-CV with significant excess of parameters in group 2. Three months after discharge from the hospital, patients in both groups had a significant increase in HCT, MCV, MCH. There was detected decrease in both groups in MCHC, RDW-CV (p<0.001 for all parameters), ESR level in group 2.At baseline, CRP exceeded reference values in both groups of patients, reaching maximum values in group 2. After 3 months CRP decreased significantly only in group 1. Increased CRP was associated with elevated hs-CRP in 3 months after discharge and elevated homocysteine levels in both groups, indicating the persistence of prolonged inflammatory vascular reaction in patients after SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia, more pronounced in group 2 patients. RDW-CV over 13.6 and lymphocytes / CRP less than 0.6 increase the likelihood of having lung tissue damage over 50% by 9.3 and 5.9 times, respectively.

Design, Setting, and Participants Participants were enrolled for this prospective cross-sectional study between August 3 and October 30, 2020, from 2 comprehensive cancer centers in the epidemic area around Tokyo, Japan. Patients with cancer aged 16 years or older and employees were enrolled. Participants with suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of enrollment were excluded. Exposures Cancer of any type and cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, surgery, immune checkpoint inhibitors, radiotherapy, and targeted molecular therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures Seroprevalence and antibody levels in patients with cancer and HCWs. Seropositivity was defined as positivity to nucleocapsid IgG (N-IgG) and/or spike IgG (S-IgG). Serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. Results A total of 500 patients with cancer (median age, 62.5 years [range, 21-88 years]; 265 men [55.4%]) and 1190 HCWs (median age, 40 years [range, 20-70 years]; 382 men [25.4%]) were enrolled.

A parametric study of the most promising Na/ZrO2 then resulted in using a catalyst:lignin ratio of 3:1 at 500 C as the best option, enhancing at 17.5 wt% the recovery of total phenolics including 6 wt% alkyl phenols, which is equivalent to 27.8 wt% and 9.5 wt% of the starting lignin in Etek lignin waste. The study of the catalyst basicity indicates that the mild basicity of Na/ZrO2 was mostly responsible for the enhanced mono phenols recovery. Due to formation of thermally stable Na2CO3 during pyrolysis, successful Na/ZrO2 regeneration requires temperature of 900 C or higher.","output":"Catalytic cracking of Etek lignin with zirconia supported metal-oxides for alkyl and alkoxy phenols recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper addresses the degree of readiness of manufacturing companies in the well-defined area of Transylvania, Romania for tackling the challenges of the low-carbon economy (LCE) in view of the ambitious goals of the European Union. The presented survey aims to provide a better understanding about the management and reduction in the carbon footprint among production companies in Romania, as this sector is not usually included official strategies or studies. One hundred and three companies, selected based on voluntary sampling responses, were investigated using a 40-item questionnaire. The survey was applied to the manufacturing sector, including automotive, furniture production, and metal processing domains, which are locally representative and a good approximation of what small- and medium-sized firms look like across the EU, thus furnishing a good view of what takes place in other countries as well. The results obtained were analyzed using univariate descriptive statistics, multi-variate item analysis, and hypothesis testing to arrive at conclusions with a high degree of applicability. The purpose was to obtain an accurate overview about the actual situation and help companies find solutions in order to reduce the carbon footprint in the production field and achieve sustainable manufacturing. We arrive at the conclusion that manufacturing firms have a high degree of interest in decarbonization, but understand the efforts required to the same degree they understand the opportunities it brings. For example, 55% of respondents are interested in the benefits of LCE, while 90% of them observe at least one environmental standard, and ca. 70% implement at least common decarbonization measures, such as electricity savings or process optimization. While raising awareness and improving technological processes are accepted and embraced, other issues (i.e., involvement in RDI and CSR, change management, as well as financing investment efforts) should be addressed by proper policies.","output":"How Well Are Manufacturing Companies in Transylvania, Romania Adapting to the Low-Carbon Economy in Order to Become Sustainable?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had a profound effect on every aspect of contemporary life, including sexuality. Physical distancing measures and limitations on large gatherings explicitly restrict in-person group sex events. We sought to understand how the pandemic and associated public health control measures have affected group sex practitioners and activities. We used a community-based participatory research approach. In fall 2019, we recruited a Community Advisory Board (CAB) of group sex key informants via community agencies, social media, and relevant websites (e.g., FetLife, Squirt). To be eligible, participants had to be at least 18 years old and have recently participated in a local group sex event (i.e. sex, broadly defined, with more than 3 people). Ethics approval was secured for the CAB as a longitudinal focus group study. Focus group meetings were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. In December 2019, participants were asked about definitions of group sex. In May 2020, participants were asked about COVID-19 impacts. Key informants shared that due to COVID-19 restrictions, group sex events were cancelled and participants only had sex with others they were isolating with. Participants emphasized the challenges of isolation, the need to be patient, but also the opportunities associated with isolation. Participants reported attending online group sex events (e.g. Zoom orgies) as well as skill-building classes (e.g. rope bondage). Participants anticipated in-person events in the future, but felt that moving online opened up new opportunities for community-building. In conclusion, participants adhered to physical distancing protocols and quickly adapted to social isolation through innovative use of technology.","output":"Group sex in the time of COVID: Intimacy, learning, and community-building in sexual communities during a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhea is an important cause of morbidity in neonatal llamas and alpacas.

It manifests clinically as an influenza-like syndrome, which can be complicated by multi-organ failure and coagulopathy, leading, in the most severe cases, even to death. The term cytokine storm was first used in 1993 to describe the graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It was then reused to define the adverse syndromes secondary to the administration of immunostimulating agents, such as anti-CD28 antibodies or bioengineered immune cells, i.e., CAR T-cell therapy. Currently, the concept of cytokine storm has been better elucidated and extended to the pathogenesis of many other conditions, such as sepsis, autoinflammatory disease, primary and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and multicentric Castleman disease. Moreover, cytokine storm has recently emerged as a key aspect in the novel Coronavirus disease 2019, as affected patients show high levels of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-, IFN-, IP-10, GM-CSF, MCP-1, and IL-10, some of which also correlate with disease severity. Therefore, since the onset of the pandemic, numerous agents have been tested in the effort to mitigate the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, some of which are effective in reducing mortality, especially in critically ill patients, and are now becoming standards of care, such as glucocorticoids or some cytokine inhibitors. However, the challenge is still far from being met, and other therapeutic strategies are being tested in the hope that we can eventually overcome the disease.","output":"Cytokine Storm in COVID-19: Immunopathogenesis and Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 pandemic fake news has been circulating impacting on the general population's opinion about a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2.

Descriptive statistics, Chi2 and ANOVA independence tests and two multivariable multinomial regression models were performed. Interactions between each variable were tested. RESULTS: Detection of fake news and health literacy scores were associated with intention to get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.01). The risk of being \\"anti-vaccination\\" or \\"hesitant\\", rather than \\"pro-vaccination\\", was higher among individuals reporting bad detection of fake news, respectively OR = 1.93 (95%CI = [1.30;2.87]) and OR = 1.80 (95%CI = [1.29;2.52]).

However, there is a lack of studies examining the prevalence of and factors associated with compassionate and respectful care practice in low-resource countries. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the practice of compassionate and respectful care and its associated factors among the health workforce (HWF). METHODS: This mixed-methods study was conducted through quantitative and qualitative data collection from April to May 2019 in North Shewa Zone health care facilities (NSHFs). For quantitative analysis, participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Participants for qualitative analysis were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Data entries were made by EpiData version 3.2 and exported to SPSS version 23 software for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the associated factors. Thematic analysis was carried out for qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 392 HWF responded to a self-administered survey, and 72 participants participated in focus group discussions (FGDs). Four categories of themes emerged: definition/knowledge, barriers, benefit, and leadership will. The prevalence of compassionate and respectful care practices was 38.8% and 46.2%, respectively. Female gender, health officer role, having a monthly salary equal to or greater than 5000 Ethiopian birr, and a positive attitude were significantly associated with compassionate care practice. The age category of 30C39, positive attitude, and ensuring a safe and clean care environment were significantly associated with respectful care practice. CONCLUSION: Compassionate and respectful care among HWF requires an actual demonstration of humanity and kindness to promote person-centered practice for their clients. Therefore, the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health should emphasize CRC continuity by including it in the health care curriculum, improving the health care ethics skill gap, designing appropriate policy to reduce workload, and promoting patient rights.","output":"The importance of compassion and respectful care for the health workforce: a mixed-methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic has caused anxiety around the world.

In the normal control group, the average value of the standard uptake value of both sides of the thyroid was used as the SUV of the thyroid gland and the highest SUV value of the patient's lesion (SUV max) represented the SUV of the lesion. After injection of imaging agent 18F-FD1G, routine imaging was performed at 1h, time-lapse imaging was performed at 2.5 h, and the changes with conventional imaging were compared to infer the benign and malignant lesions. We used SPSS software to carry out statistical analysis, respectively, carrying out analysis of variance, paired t-test, independent sample t-test, and linear correlation analysis. In the thyroid cancer group, 87.5% of the delayed imaging SUV was higher than the conventional imaging SUV, while 83.33% of the benign disease group had a lower SUV than the conventional imaging SUV. 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis in patients with Tg positive. However, it has lower sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of 131I-Dx-WBS negative DTC and 18F-FDG PET/CT. The specificity increases with the increase of serum Tg level. The above results confirm that 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging is of great significance for the diagnosis of recurrence or metastasis in patients; with PET/CT imaging, the results changed 16.13% of the Tg-positive and 131I-Dx-WBS negative DTC patients' later treatment decision.

The systematic investigation of clinically approved drugs is a priority to determine what does mitigate disease severity. Oestradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) produce a state of anti-inflammatory immune responses and immune tolerance, and enhanced antibody production. The goal of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a short E2 and P4 therapy, in addition to standard of care (SOC), in mitigating disease severity in COVID-19 hospitalised patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Phase 2, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre trial. Patients hospitalised for confirmed COVID-19, with scores 3C5 on the 9-point WHO ordinal scale are randomised between two arms: (1) Oestradiol cypionate intramuscular (IM) and micronised progesterone oral (PO), in addition to SOC, and (2) placebo, in addition to SOC. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients improving to scores 1 or 2 on the WHO scale through day 28. Secondary outcomes include length of hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, cause of death, readmission rates, change in inflammatory biomarkers between admission and occurrence of primary endpoint, and adverse events.
