To understand the specificity of Delta-elicited antibody immunity, we characterize the polyclonal antibody response elicited by primary or mRNA vaccine-breakthrough Delta infections. Both types of infection elicit a neutralizing antibody response focused heavily on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). We use deep mutational scanning to show that mutations to the RBDs class 1 and class 2 epitopes, including sites 417, 478, and 484C486 often reduce binding of these Delta-elicited antibodies. The anti-Delta antibody response is more similar to that elicited by early 2020 viruses than the Beta variant, with mutations to the class 1 and 2, but not class 3 epitopes, having the largest effects on polyclonal antibody binding. In addition, mutations to the class 1 epitope (e.g., K417N) tend to have larger effects on antibody binding and neutralization in the Delta spike than in the D614G spike, both for vaccine- and Delta-infection-elicited antibodies.

OPEFB which has decayed naturally for 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years were obtained from the Oil Palm Plantation, PTPN VIII Cikasungka, Bogor, Indonesia. In this study, fungal and bacterial diversity in naturally decaying OPEFB in plantations was identified using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the ITS2 for fungal, the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene for bacterial. Bacterial diversity in decaying OPEFB was dominated by the phylum Planctomycetes (40-60%), whereas most of the fungal sequences taken belonged to Ascomycota (60-90%). Biodiversity profile resulting from metagenomic analysis is useful for increasing knowledge about microbial composition in the natural degradation process of OPEFB. The resulting data can be used to compare the diversity of bacteria at different weathering times and depths. In-depth observation of the diversity of lignin-degrading microbes from the natural decomposition of OPEFB has the potential to discover novel enzymes and ligninolytic activities that are useful for the fast degradation of OPEFB, production of biofuels based on enzymatic technology, and the development of high value-added biomass products.","output":"Metagenomic data of microbial in natural empty fruit bunches degradation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS coronavirus ORF6 inhibits the classical nuclear import pathway to antagonize host antiviral responses.

Using this method, we found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is [~]5 times more potent than SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 in inhibiting bidirectional nuclear transport, due to differences in the NUP98-binding C-terminal region that is required for the inhibition. The N-terminal region was also required, but its membrane binding function was dispensable, since loss of the inhibitory function due to N-terminal truncation was rescued by forced oligomerization using a soluble construct. Based on these data, we propose that the hydrophobic N-terminal region drives oligomerization of ORF6 to multivalently cross-link the FG domains of NUP98 at the nuclear pore complex.","output":"Quantification of nuclear transport inhibition by SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 using a broadly applicable live-cell dose-response pipeline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide and its burden is increasing rapidly in low-income and middle-income countries, many of which are unable to face the challenges it imposes.

Whether this translates to reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) is unknown. METHODS: We used the US Department of Veterans Affairs COVID-19 Shared Data Resource to identify all Veterans who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between January 26, 2021 and August 31, 2021. Using International Classification of Diseases, 10 th edition codes and attendance at a dialysis clinic or center, we identified those who were on chronic hemodialysis. We used a test-negative, case-control design using a doubly-robust logistic regression model to determine the VE of the BNT-162b2 (Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines in preventing confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 847,199 Veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 between January 26, 2021 and August 31, 2021, there were 6,076 Veterans on chronic hemodialysis. Among those, we identified 1,270 cases (580 fully vaccinated) and 2,959 controls (2,120 fully vaccinated). The overall VE >14 days after the second dose in preventing documented infection was 68.2% (95% CI:62.6,72.9). VE was 68.9% (95% CI:61.9,74.7) for Pfizer-BNT-162b2 and 66.7% (95% CI:58.9,73.0) for Moderna-mRNA-1273 vaccine. There was no difference in VE by age (<70 vs. >70 years), race or sex. There were no events recorded in persons with a Charlsons comorbidity index score of <2.

Both theoretical and experimental efforts are being made to find an effective treatment to suppress the virus, constituting the forefront of current global safety concerns and a significant burden on global economies. The development of innovative materials able to prevent the transmission, spread, and entry of COVID-19 pathogens into the human body is currently in the spotlight. The synthesis of these materials is, therefore, gaining momentum, as methods providing nontoxic and environmentally friendly procedures are in high demand. Here, a highly virucidal material constructed from SiO2-Ag composite immobilized in a polymeric matrix (ethyl vinyl acetate) is presented. The experimental results indicated that the as-fabricated samples exhibited high antibacterial activity towards Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as well as towards SARS-CoV-2. Based on the present results and radical scavenger experiments, we propose a possible mechanism to explain the enhancement of the biocidal activity. In the presence of O2 and H2O, the plasmon-assisted surface mechanism is the major reaction channel generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). We believe that the present strategy based on the plasmonic effect would be a significant contribution to the design and preparation of efficient biocidal materials.

Children and infants are more vulnerable for this fecal-oral transmitted disease. In prior years, this disease received less public health attention. Fortunately, improvements in water supply infrastructures, waste management, and community awareness on hygiene indirectly affect the prevalence of this disease. This study evaluated the trends of amoebic dysentery and related factors in the past five years in Thailand. Methods & Materials: We collected and analysed data of amoebic dysentery annual prevalence, age groups, population density, water sources and household utilities from all provinces in Thailand during 2016-2020. Data were retrieved from National Statistical Office and Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. Results: There was a constant fall in amoebic dysentery morbidity rates from 2016 (4.65/100.000) to 2020 (0.95/100,000), with an average annual reduction of 0.8 points, and the highest decline from 2019 to 2020. The most vulnerable age group was children below 15 years, followed by geriatrics of over 55 years, with geometric means of 35.2% and 26.4%, respectively. The decrease in cases is correlated with increased number of clean water supplies with over 600,000 artesian and shallow wells countrywide (accounting for roughly 1 well for 11 people), and 89% of households having access to tap water. Interestingly, the highest case contributions persistently stemmed from the provinces at the country borders with Myanmar (Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, Tak), Cambodia (Sisaket, Ubon Ratchatani), and Malaysia (Songkhla, Yala), which accounts for an average of 49.8% of total cases. Further exploration is required to elucidate geographical- and cultural-related risks in these areas. Conclusion: The consistent reduction of amoebic dysentery cases in the last five years depicts a promising trend of amoebiasis control. Beside improvement of infrastructures, more training opportunities and empowerments were provided for laboratory technicians and village health volunteers. Nevertheless, the sharp decline in 2020 might be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, sustainable risk-mitigation and monitoring programs still need to be implemented for thorough elimination of amoebic dysentery.","output":"Trends of Amoebic Dysentery in Thailand in 2016-2020: Successful Control Program or Decreased Surveillance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of the lower gastrointestinal tract. The pathophysiology is far from settled, but a gut microbial dysbiosis is hypothesized to be a contributing factor. We earlier published a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for IBS - the REFIT trial. The present data set describes the engraftment and includes participants from the study who received active FMT; 14 participants with effect of FMT (Effect) and 8 without (No effect). Samples were collected at baseline, after 6 and 12 months. Samples from the transplants (Donor) served as a comparator. In total 66 recipient samples and 17 donor samples were subjected to deep metagenomic sequencing, and taxonomic and functional analyses were performed. Alpha diversity measures showed a significantly increased diversity and evenness in the IBS groups compared to the donors. Taxonomic profiles showed higher relative abundance of phylum Firmicutes, and lower relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, compared to donors at baseline. This profile was shifted toward the donor profile following FMT. Imputed growth rates showed that the resulting growth pattern was a conglomerate of donor and recipient activity. Thirty-four functional subclasses showed distinct differences between baseline samples and donors, most of which were shifted toward a donor-like profile after FMT. All of these changes were less pronounced in the No effect group. We conclude that FMT induces long-term changes in gut microbiota, and these changes mirror the clinical effect of the treatment.

Within a year, a few COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and authorized. This unparalleled initiative in developing vaccines created many uncertainties looming around the efficacy and safety of these vaccines. This study aimed to assess the side effects and perceptions following COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing an online survey targeted toward Jordan inhabitants who received any COVID-19 vaccines. Data were statistically analyzed and certain machine learning (ML) tools, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and K-star were used to predict the severity of side effects. Results: A total of 2213 participants were involved in the study after receiving Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, and other vaccines (38.2%, 31%, 27.3%, and 3.5%, respectively). Generally, most of the post-vaccination side effects were common and non-life-threatening (e.g., fatigue, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, joint pain, and myalgia). Only 10% of participants suffered from severe side effects;while 39% and 21% of participants had moderate and mild side effects, respectively. Despite the substantial variations between these vaccines in the presence and severity of side effects, the statistical analysis indicated that these vaccines might provide the same protection against COVID-19 infection. Finally, around 52.9% of participants suffered before vaccination from vaccine hesitancy and anxiety;while after vaccination, 95.5% of participants have advised others to get vaccinated, 80% felt more reassured, and 67% believed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe in the long term. Furthermore, based on the type of vaccine, demographic data, and side effects, the RF, XGBoost, and MLP gave both high accuracies (0.80, 0.79, and 0.70, respectively) and Cohens kappa values (0.71, 0.70, and 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: The present study confirmed that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and getting vaccinated makes people more reassured. Most of the post-vaccination side effects are mild to moderate, which are signs that bodys immune system is building protection. ML can also be used to predict the severity of side effects based on the input data;predicted severe cases may require more medical attention or even hospitalization.","output":"Side Effects and Perceptions Following COVID-19 Vaccination in Jordan: A Randomized, Cross-Sectional Study Implementing Machine Learning for Predicting Severity of Side Effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza A virus (swIAV) are major pathogens of the porcine respiratory disease complex, but little is known on their interaction in super-infected pigs.

In PRRSV/swIAV group, the clinical signs usually observed after swIAV infection were attenuated while higher levels of anti-swIAV antibodies were measured in lungs. Concurrently, PRRSV multiplication in lungs was significantly affected by swIAV infection, whereas the cell-mediated immune response specific to PRRSV was detected earlier in blood, as compared to PRRSV group. Moreover, levels of interferon (IFN)- measured from SD9 in the blood of super-infected pigs were lower than those measured in the swIAV group, but higher than in the PRRSV group at the same time.

Preliminary cross-sectional research has demonstrated increases in mental health problems in mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-pandemic estimates. We aimed to study an existing longitudinal cohort of mothers to assess changes in the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic over time and at the individual level. METHODS: In this longitudinal observational study, women who took part in the All Our Families pregnancy cohort in Canada were invited to complete a COVID-19 impact survey between May 20 and July 15, 2020. Women who had not agreed to additional research, had discontinued, were lost to follow-up, or who were not contactable via email were excluded. Maternal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with three previous estimates collected at 3, 5, and 8-year timepoints (between April, 2012, and October, 2019). Depression symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to assess temporal trends and fixed-effects regression models were fitted to assess within-person change over time. FINDINGS: Of the 3387 women included in the All Our Families study, 2445 women were eligible and were invited to participate in the COVID-19 impact study, of whom 1333 consented to participate, and 1301 were included in the longitudinal analysis. At the COVID-19 impact survey timepoint, a higher proportion of mothers had clinically significant depression (3521%, 95% CI 3248-3804) and anxiety symptoms (3139%, 2876-3415) than at all previous data collection timepoints. The mean depression score (831, 95% CI 797-865) and anxiety score (1190, 1166-1213) at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint were higher than previous data collection waves at the 3-year timepoint (mean depression score 505, 485-525; mean anxiety score 951, 935-966), 5-year timepoint (mean depression score 543, 520-566; mean anxiety score 949, 933-965), and 8-year timepoint (mean depression score 579, 555-602; mean anxiety score 1026, 1010-1042). For the within-person comparisons, depression scores were a mean of 230 points (95% CI 195-265) higher and anxiety scores were a mean of 104 points (065-143) higher at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint, after controlling for time trends. Larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed for women who had income disruptions, difficulty balancing home schooling with work responsibilities, and those with difficulty obtaining childcare. White mothers had greater increases in anxiety scores than non-white mothers and health-care workers had smaller increases in depressive symptoms than non-health-care workers. INTERPRETATION: Compared with previous estimates, the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety among mothers in a Canadian cohort increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial support, childcare provision, and avoiding the closure of schools, might be key priorities for preventing future increases in maternal psychological distress.

METHODS: This case study consisted of implementing an organization-wide behavioral safety program in a private school that served students diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. During the course of the study, 124 to 128 direct care staff were employed by the school and served 168 students during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the behavioral safety program, there were a variable but continuous number of safety observations. The percent of safe behavior in the classrooms began near 90% and approached 100% at the conclusion of data collection. During the study there were no documented COVID-19 infections traced to the school. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral safety programs could be effective in promoting behavior associated with minimizing virus transmission; therefore, these programs may also have utility in preventing communicable diseases in human service settings.","output":"Human Services During the COVID Pandemic: Using Behavioral Safety Programs to Protect Human Services Workers and Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organic acid and essential oils (EOs), well-known antimicrobials, could also possess antiviral activity, a characteristic which has not been completely addressed up to now. In this study, the effect of two organic acids (formic acid and sodium salt of coconut fatty acid distillates) and two single EO compounds (thymol and cinnamaldehye) was evaluated against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The concentration used for each compound was established by cytotoxicity assays in Vero cells. The antiviral activity was then evaluated at three multiplicities of infection (MOIs) through visual cytopathic effect (CPE) evaluation and an alamarBlue assay as well as real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and viral titration of cell supernatants. Formic acid at at a dose of 1,200 ppm was the only compound which showed antiviral activity, with a weak reduction of CPE caused by PEDV. Through the alamarBlue fluorescence assay, we showed a significant anti-CPE effect of formic acid which could not be observed by using an inverted optical microscope. RT-qPCR and infectivity analysis also showed that formic acid significantly reduced viral RNA and viral titers in a PEDV MOI-dependent manner. Our results suggest that the antiviral activity of formic acid could be associated to its inhibitory effect on viral replication. Further studies are required to explore the anti-PEDV activity of formic acid under field conditions alone or together with other antiviral agents.","output":"In vitro Assessment of Antiviral Effect of Natural Compounds on Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome the lack of human resources during this crisis, some ICUs had to mobilize staff from a reinforcement pool, with no or outdated ICU experience. This study aimed to investigate and to compare the psychological impact of the pandemic on ICU regular staff and reinforcement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Self-assessment questionnaire were completed by HCWs who worked from March the 1st to April the 30th 2020 in our 16 bed Neurological-ICU at La Piti-Salptrire Hospital in Paris, France, which was converted to a COVID-ICU. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire-Revised, and 10-item ConnorCDavidson Resilience Scale were used to assess respectively anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), quality of life (QoL) and resilience. RESULTS: Sixty-nine ICU-HCWs completed the survey (37 from the regular staff, i.e from the public health service, and 32 from a reinforcement pool, either from non-ICU public health service, or from private health care interim employment agencies). Prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms were high, at 19%, 9% and 16% respectively, with limited impairment in QoL or resilience scores. Depression symptoms were more observed in the regular staff compared to welcomed reinforcement, respectively at 16% and 0%. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that during the pandemic, HCWs from the regular staff were at greater risk of developing psychological disorder compared to reinforcement, with higher levels of depressive symptoms.","output":"COVID-19 crisis in Paris: a differential psychological impact between ICU regular staff and reinforcement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Lean approach has become a trend due to its credibility achieved in several sectors, including Health services having target at the care and security of patients. This paper aims to map how Lean tools are being used in healthcare and what are their results, including those related to humanization. Methods: : A Systematic Literature Review was performed according to the following steps: search for articles approaching the Lean Healthcare theme published in English between 2014 and 2020, selected on the databases of Web of Science, Scopus and Compendex (no other articles were introduced on the literature review), followed by discarding duplicates. The records were screening focusing in the section of articles reporting cases of lean healthcare adopting. No articles were excluded after the screening, which resulted in 48 articles that were deeper analysed through both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results: : Value Stream Mapping (VSM), 5S and Kaizen were the most used Lean tools in related study, with 24, 14 and 13 occurrences. The simulation and the 5 Whys were Lean tools less used, with 3 and 2 occurrences. The main benefits found with the use of such tools were a reduction in the service time and an increase in patient satisfaction. The influence of teams and doctors behavior was identified as barrier to Lean implementation. Conclusions: : The word \\"human\\" was discovered to be the most used word to describe Lean works in healthcare, that was not related in earlier reviews. There was also an increase in the number of Brazilian publications on subject, compared to previous period, in which the United States led on the number of publications. Throughout the study, two related cases added an annual savings of US $ 444,911, with the implementation of Lean Healthcare. The Lean approach has been applied in some health services to reduce the time of attendance and increase patient satisfaction. These results are indicative for expanding its application in the context of pandemics such as COVID-19.","output":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of lean methods and tools in healthcare services: an alternative to improve care during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The original article can be found online.","output":"Correction to: Computed tomography surveillance helps tracking COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to examine whether telehealth is as safe and effective as traditional office visits in assessing and treating patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, the primary outcome was any 14-day related healthcare follow-up event(s). Secondary outcomes were the type of 14-day related follow-up event including hospital admission, emergency department visit, office visit, telehealth visit and/or multiple follow-up visits. Individual visit types were identified due to the significant difference between a hospital admission and an office visit. Logistic regressions were done using the predictors of visit type, age, gender and comorbidities and the primary outcome variable of a related follow-up visit and then by follow-up type: hospital admission, emergency department visit or office visit. RESULTS: Of 1305 visits, median age was 42.3 years and 65.8% were female. Traditional office visits accounted for 741 (56.8%) of initial visits, while 564 (43.2%) visits occurred via telehealth. One hundred and forty-six (25.9%) of the telehealth visits resulted in a 14-day related healthcare follow-up visit versus 161 (21.7%) of the office visits (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 0.94-1.58). DISCUSSION: There was no significant difference in related follow-ups of initial telehealth visits compared to initial office visits including no significant difference in hospital admission or emergency department visits. These findings suggest that based on follow up healthcare utilization, telehealth may be a safe and effective option in assessing and treating patients with respiratory symptoms as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","output":"Comparing telehealth to traditional office visits for patient management in the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study in a respiratory assessment clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute lung injury has few treatment options and a high mortality rate.

We reviewed the data of all allogeneic HSCT recipients referred to our pulmonary department for a non-infectious bronchial disease between 1999 and 2010. We identified 103 patients (BOS (n=77), asthma (n=11) and chronic bronchitis (n=15)).

The typical OLD was characterized by more severe FEV1 and fewer centrilobular nodules on the computed tomography scan. The FEV1 was not significantly affected during the follow-up, regardless of the phenotype. In addition to acute and extensive chronic GVHD, only the occurrence of BOS soon after transplantation and the intentional treatment of BOS with steroids were associated with a poor survival.

On the other hand, regarding mechanistic insight, the antioxidant activity and cytoprotective effects of OSO are relatively less known. The current study compared the antioxidant ability and protective ability of OSO on cells and embryos against oxidative stress, such as H(2)O(2) and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL), to investigate its potential applications for wound-healing and anti-infection. OSO showed potent radical scavenging activity and ferric ion reduction ability that was up to 35% and 42% stronger than sunflower oil (SO) as a control in a dose-dependent manner. Measurement of the wavelength-maximum fluorescence (WMF) of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) revealed different behavior between OSO and SO treatment (final 1C16%). The OSO treatment caused a 12 nm red shift of Trp movement from 345 nm (at 0%) to 357 nm (at 16%), while SO caused a 12 nm blue shift of Trp movement from 345 nm (at 0%) to 333 nm (at 16%). The fluorescence intensity of HDL(3) was diminished remarkably by the OSO treatment by up to 80% from the initial level, while SO-treated HDL did not. OSO-treated HDL(3) showed slower electromobility with stronger band intensity and bigger HDL particle sizes than those of SO-treated HDL(3). The paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity of HDL(3) was enhanced by a co-treatment of OSO that was up to 2.3 times higher than HDL(3) alone in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the co-treatment of SO even inhibited the PON activity. The cell viability of RAW264.7 by the OSO treatment was 3.3 times higher than the SO treatment at a high dose range (from 10% to 50%, final). The OSO also exhibited more cytoprotective effects than SO in brain microglial cells in the presence of H(2)O(2) (final 0.03%); treatment with OSO impeded apoptosis and reduced ROS production more than an SO treatment did. In the presence of H(2)O(2) alone, 86  5% of the embryos were killed by cell explosion after 24 h, but a co-treatment of OSO (final 4%) resulted in almost no embryo death (98% survivability). Injection of oxLDL (15 ng of protein) into zebrafish embryos caused acute death, while the co-injection of OSO (final 2%) resulted in 2.8 times higher survivability than oxLDL alone.

Thus, the TNF antibodies have great potential application in diagnostics and therapy fields. The variable binding domain of IgNAR (VNAR), the shark single domain antibody, has some excellent advantages in terms of size, solubility, and thermal and chemical stability, making them an ideal alternative to conventional antibodies. This study aims to obtain VNARs that are specific for mouse TNF (mTNF) from whitespotted bamboosharks. After immunization of whitespotted bamboosharks, the peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were isolated from the sharks, then the VNAR phage display library was constructed. Through phage display panning against mTNF, positive clones were validated through ELISA assay. The affinity of the VNAR and mTNF was measured using ELISA and Bio-Layer Interferometry. The binding affinity of 3B11 VNAR reached 16.7 nM. Interestingly, one new type of VNAR targeting mTNF was identified that does not belong to any known VNAR type. To understand the binding mechanism of VNARs to mTNF, the models of VNARs-mTNF complexes were predicted by computational modeling combining HawkDock and RosettaDock. Our results showed that four VNARs epitopes overlapped in part with that of mTNFR. Furthermore, the ELISA assay shows that the 3B11 potently inhibited mTNF binding to mTNFR.

However, the mastery of echocardiography requires significant training, and not all medical teams involve an echocardiography specialist. Telemedicine approaches can potentially improve the quality of echocardiography in resource-limited situations. METHODS: We used a novel tablet-based hand-held ultrasound device that enables tele-ultrasound a real-time video telecommunication with remote control for ultrasound images. A trainee scanned patients with various cardiovascular diseases and interpreted the images. Subsequently, the same trainee re-scanned the same patients and re-interpreted the same images using tele-ultrasound with an echocardiography specialist. An examination on the same patients by a blinded specialist was considered the gold standard. RESULTS: We included 31 patients (median 77 [interquartile range 68C84] years old, 42% women). Mean absolute errors in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, visual LV ejection fraction, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion decreased significantly after tele-ultrasound advice (5.9 mm, 5.8 mm, 8.6%, and 4.5 to 1.6 mm, 2.8 mm, 0.7%, and 1.8 mm, respectively, all p < 0.001), and intra-class correlation coefficients improved (0.76, 0.84, 0.68, and 0.44 to 0.96, 0.93, 0.99, and 0.90, respectively). Notably, with tele-advice, the trainees examination showed perfect agreement with that of the specialist in classifying LV ejection fraction (> 50%, 50C35%, or > 35%) and identifying significant valvular heart diseases.

S is present on virions as prefusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies depends upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here, we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer stabilized in the closed state to prevent full exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with the receptor. We compared this with other modified S protein constructs, including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induced a T cell response and long-lived, strongly neutralizing antibody responses against 2019 SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern P.1 and B.1.351. Notably, the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralizing responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different, but equally potent, immune responses than open spikes and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. We suggest that closed spikes, together with their improved stability and storage properties, may be a valuable component of refined, next-generation vaccines. IMPORTANCE Vaccines in use against SARS-CoV-2 induce immune responses against the spike protein. There is intense interest in whether the antibody response induced by vaccines will be robust against new variants, as well as in next-generation vaccines for use in previously infected or immunized individuals. We assessed the use as an immunogen of a spike protein engineered to be conformationally stabilized in the closed state where the receptor binding site is occluded. Despite occlusion of the receptor binding site, the spike induces potently neutralizing sera against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Antibodies are raised against a different pattern of epitopes to those induced by other spike constructs, preferring conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Closed spikes, or mRNA vaccines based on their sequence, can be a valuable component of next-generation vaccines.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Stabilized in the Closed State Induces Potent Neutralizing Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To identify risk factors for acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in patients exposed to an MRSA-colonized roommate.

METHODS Exposed roommates were identified from infection-control logs and from results of screening for MRSA in the microbiology database. Completed follow-up was defined as completion of at least 2 sets of screening cultures (swab samples from the nares, the rectum, and skin lesions), with at least 1 set of samples obtained 7-10 days after the last exposure. Chart reviews were performed to compare those who did and did not become colonized with MRSA. RESULTS Of 326 roommates, 198 (61.7%) had completed follow-up, and 25 (12.6%) acquired MRSA by day 7-10 after exposure was recognized, all with strains indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis from those of their roommate. Two (2%) of 101 patients were not colonized at day 7-10 but, with subsequent testing, were identified as being colonized with the same strain as their roommate (one at day 16 and one at day 18 after exposure). A history of alcohol abuse (odds ratio [OR], 9.8 [95% confidence limits {CLs}, 1.8, 53]), exposure to a patient with nosocomially acquired MRSA (OR, 20 [95% CLs, 2.4, 171]), increasing care dependency (OR per activity of daily living, 1.7 [95% CLs, 1.1, 2.7]), and having received levofloxacin (OR, 3.6 [95% CLs, 1.1, 12]) were associated with MRSA acquisition. CONCLUSIONS Roommates of patients with MRSA are at significant risk for becoming colonized. Further study is needed of the impact of hospital antimicrobial formulary decisions on the risk of acquisition of MRSA.","output":"Risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition in roommate contacts of patients colonized or infected with MRSA in an acute-care hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged suddenly at the end of 2019 and the disease came to be known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, there is no specific therapy established to treat COVID-19. Identifying effective treatments is urgently required to treat patients and stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. For the present review, >100 publications on therapeutic agents for COVID-19, including in vitro and in vivo animal studies, case reports, retrospective analyses and meta-analyses were retrieved from PubMed and analyzed, and promising therapeutic agents that may be used to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection were highlighted. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, different drugs have been repurposed for its treatment. Existing drugs, including chloroquine (CQ), its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir and nucleoside analogues, monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, Chinese herbal medicine and natural compounds for treating COVID-19 evaluated in experimental and clinical studies were discussed. Although early clinical studies suggested that CQ/HCQ produces antiviral action, later research indicated certain controversy regarding their use for treating COVID-19. The molecular mechanisms of these therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV2 have been investigated, including inhibition of viral interactions with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in human cells, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA replication and the packaging of viral particles.

We sought to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in the overall screening for acute stroke utilizing a commercial clinical artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Methods: Data were derived from the Viz Platform, an AI application designed to optimize the workflow of acute stroke patients. Neuroimaging data on suspected stroke patients across 97 hospitals in 20 US states were collected in real-time and retrospectively analyzed with the number of patients undergoing imaging screening serving as a surrogate for the amount of stroke care. The main outcome measures were the number of CTA, CTP, Large vessel occlusions (LVOs) (defined according to the automated software detection), and severe strokes on CTP (defined as those with hypoperfusion volumes&gt;70mL) normalized as number of patients per day per hospital. Data from the pre-pandemic (November 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1 to May 10, 2020) periods were compared at national and state levels. Correlations were made between the inter-period changes in imaging screening, stroke hospitalizations, and thrombectomy procedures using state-specific sampling. Results: A total of 23,223 patients were included. The incidence of LVO on CTA and severe strokes on CTP were 11.2%(n=2,602) and 14.7%(n=1,229/8,328), respectively. There were significant declines in the overall number of CTAs (-22.8%;1.39 to 1.07 patients/day/hospital,p&lt;0.001) and CTPs (-26.1%;0.50 to 0.37 patients/day/hospital,p&lt;0.001) as well as in the incidence of LVO (-17.1%;0.15 to 0.13 patients/day/hospital,p&lt;0.001) and severe strokes on CTP (-16.7%;0.12 to 0.10 patients/day/hospital, p&lt;0.005). The sampled cohort showed similar declines in the rates of LVOs versus thrombectomy (18.8%vs.19.5%, p=0.9) and CSC hospitalizations (18.8%vs.11.0%, p=0.4). Conclusions: A significant decline in stroke imaging screening has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aims of this study were (a) to explore the association between the mental health promotion strategies used by nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak and their symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress; (b) to compare the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress of mental health nurses to those of non-mental health nurses; and (c) to compare the frequency of use of mental health strategies of mental health nurses to those of non-mental health nurses. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 821 nurses. Univariate and multivariate regression models were developed to identify potential protective factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. The chi-square test was also used to compare the use of strategies among mental health and non-mental health nurses. Portuguese nurses demonstrated high symptoms of depressive symptoms, stress, and anxiety. Healthy eating, physical activity, rest between shifts, maintaining social contacts, verbalizing feelings/emotions, and spending less time searching for information about COVID-19 were associated with better mental health. Mental health nurses had less depression, anxiety, and stress, and used more strategies to promote mental health than other nurses.

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Proning improves blood oxygenation and survival rates in these patients but is not commonly performed due to the difficulty of the procedure. METHODS: An academic literature review, internet video search, and consultation with five subject-matter experts was performed to identify known methods for proning. Evaluation of each method considered the number of healthcare workers required, physical stresses on staff, risk of adverse events to patients, and equipment cost and availability. RESULTS: Several variations of manual techniques and-lift assisted techniques were identified in addition to a specialized proning bed. Manual methods require more healthcare workers, higher physical stresses, and greater risk of adverse events than lift-assisted methods or the proning bed. CONCLUSION: Both the specialized proning bed and a lift-assisted method using straps largely eliminated manual forces required for proning while allowing for a controlled lowering and positioning of the patient.

The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of an exercise intervention on cognitive function in older T2DM patients. Methods: Eight literature databases (PubMed, EBSCO, Scopus, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Ovid, and ProQuest) were searched from inception to 20 January 2022. The researchers examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the impact of exercise on the cognitive performance of older T2DM patients. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs was used to assess each study. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluations) approach. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Modified MMSE (3MSE), and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) were used to evaluate the cognitive outcomes. We performed a subgroup analysis with stratification according to exercise intervention modality, duration, and cognitive impairment. Results: Five trials were eligible, with a total of 738 T2DM patients. The combined findings revealed that exercise improved global cognitive function significantly (standardized mean difference: 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.23-2.44, p < 0.01). The effect of exercise on global cognitive performance was not significantly influenced by intervention modality, intervention duration, or cognitive impairment in the sub-group analysis (p > 0.05). In the studies that were included, no relevant adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Exercise is beneficial in improving global cognitive function in older adults with T2DM.

Open reading frame 3 (ORF3) is the only accessory gene in the PEDV genome. The entire ORF3 genes of 12 PEDV field strains and one vaccine strain were sequenced. The ORF3 genes of Chinese PEDV field strains (excluding CH/GSJIII/07) contain a single 672- or 675-nucleotide (nt) ORF, which encodes a 223- or 224-aa-long peptide.

The Chinese PEDV field strains and PEDV reference strains are divided into three groups based on the phylogenetic relationship of their ORF3 genes. Chinese PEDV field strains (excluding CH/GSJIII/07) have a close phylogenetic relationship to Korean strains and are genetically different from the PEDV vaccine strains. However, CH/GSJIII/07 has a close phylogenetic relationship to two vaccine strains, suggesting that it might have evolved from a live vaccine strain.

Anatomy into the battle is of importance to address public concerns, beliefs, and values, thereby enabling policymakers to determine the appropriate solutions to implement reopening policy. To this end, we investigated over 1.5 million related Twitter postings from April 17 to May 30, 2020. With the aid of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning classifiers, we classified each tweet into either a supporting or opposing class and then investigated the public perception from temporal and spatial perspectives. From the temporal dimension, we found that both political and scientific news that were extensively discussed on Twitter led to the perception of opposing reopening. Further, being the first mover with full reopen adversely affected the public reaction to reopening policy, while being the follower or late mover resulted in positive responses. From the spatial dimension, the correlation and regression analyses suggest that the state-level perception was very likely to be associated with political affiliation and health value.","output":"Anatomy into the battle of supporting or opposing reopening amid the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter: A temporal and spatial analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Around 350 million people are living with hepatitis B virus (HBV), which can lead to death due to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Abstract Introduction: Hypertension has been associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection, so concerns have been raised about the possibility that inhibitors of the reninCangiotensin system (RAS) could influence the prognosis of these patients. Methods: This is an observational study of 921 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19 respiratory infection to Hospital General Universitario Ciudad Real from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Following data were collected including patient demographic information, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, therapeutic interventions during the hospitalization and clinical outcomes. Results: The mean age was 78 years, and 59,2% of patients had a history of hypertension. Patients with previous treatment with RAS inhibitor (42,4%) showed lower risk of the primary composite endopoint (mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation). Treatment with RAS inhibitor (both outpatient treatment and during hospitalization) had neither effect on mortality nor need for invasive ventilation. There were no differences in time-to-event analysis between groups. Conclusions: RAS inhibitor treatment prior to admission in patients with COVID-19 respiratory infection was associated with lower risk of the primary composite endpoint and did not show neither impact on mortality nor need for invasive mechanical ventilation, even if these drugs were prescribed during hospitalization.","output":"Anlisis de la relacin entre los inhibidores del sistema renina-angiotensina y la evolucin de pacientes hospitalizados por infeccin respiratoria COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is the position of the International Network for Child and Family Centered Care (INCFCC) that COVID19 restrictions pose tremendous challenges for the health care team in their efforts to provide child and family centered care (CFCC).

Immediately after the inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, alveolar type II epithelial cells harbor and initiate local innate immunity. These particles can infect circulating macrophages, which then present the coronavirus antigens to T cells. Subsequently, the activation and differentiation of various types of T cells, as well as uncontrollable cytokine release (also known as cytokine storms), result in tissue destruction and amplification of the immune response. Vitamin D enhances the innate immunity required for combating COVID-19 by activating toll-like receptor 2. It also enhances antimicrobial peptide synthesis, such as through the promotion of the expression and secretion of cathelicidin and -defensin; promotes autophagy through autophagosome formation; and increases the synthesis of lysosomal degradation enzymes within macrophages. Regarding adaptive immunity, vitamin D enhances CD4(+) T cells, suppresses T helper 17 cells, and promotes the production of virus-specific antibodies by activating T cell-dependent B cells. Moreover, vitamin D attenuates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CD4(+) T cells through nuclear factor B signaling, thereby inhibiting the development of a cytokine storm. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells after its spike proteins are bound to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Vitamin D increases the bioavailability and expression of ACE2, which may be responsible for trapping and inactivating the virus. Activation of the reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAS) is responsible for tissue destruction, inflammation, and organ failure related to SARS-CoV-2. Vitamin D inhibits renin expression and serves as a negative RAS regulator. In conclusion, vitamin D defends the body against SARS-CoV-2 through a novel complex mechanism that operates through interactions between the activation of both innate and adaptive immunity, ACE2 expression, and inhibition of the RAS system. Multiple observation studies have shown that serum concentrations of 25 hydroxyvitamin D are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. The evidence gathered thus far, generally meets Hills causality criteria in a biological system, although experimental verification is not sufficient. We speculated that adequate vitamin D supplementation may be essential for mitigating the progression and severity of COVID-19. Future studies are warranted to determine the dosage and effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation among different populations of individuals with COVID-19.","output":"Immunological Aspects of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the Putative Beneficial Role of Vitamin-D"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: The characteristics of patients with respiratory complaints and/or lung radiologic abnormalities after hospitalisation for COVID-19 are unknown. The objectives were to determine their characteristics and the relationships between dyspnoea, radiologic abnormalities and functional impairment. METHODS: In the COMEBAC cohort study, 478 hospital survivors were evaluated by telephone 4 months after hospital discharge, and 177 who had been hospitalised in an intensive care unit (ICU) or presented relevant symptoms underwent an ambulatory evaluation. New-onset dyspnoea and cough were evaluated, and the results of pulmonary function tests, high-resolution computed tomography of the chest were collected. RESULTS: Among the 478 patients, 78 (16.3%) reported new-onset dyspnoea, and 23 (4.8%) new-onset cough. The patients with new-onset dyspnoea were younger (56.112.3 versus 61.916.6 years), had more severe COVID-19 (ICU admission 56.4% versus 24.5%) and more frequent pulmonary embolism (18.0% versus 6.8%) (all p0.001) than patients without dyspnoea. Among the patients reassessed at the ambulatory care visit, the prevalence of fibrotic lung lesions was 19.3%, with extent <25% in 97% of the patients. The patients with fibrotic lesions were older (6111 versus 5614 years, p=0.03), more frequently managed in ICU (87.9 versus 47.4%, p<0.001), had lower total lung capacity (74.113.7 versus 84.914.8%pred, p<0.001) and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (73.317.9 versus 89.722.8%pred, p<0.001).

By taking advantage of a previous survey, conducted online from 22 April to 7 May 2020, we performed a post-hoc analysis with the aim to assess the associations between disability, physical exercise, and mental health in multiple sclerosis. We retrieved the following data: (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) changes in lifestyle (including exercise), (iii) physical disability, as measured with the Patient-Determined Disease Steps scale, and (iv) anxiety feelings and depressive symptoms assessed via the items included in the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders measurement system. Examination of the interaction plot showed that the effect of disability on depression, but not on anxious symptoms, was significant for all levels of physical exercise (low: b = 1.22, 95% C.I. 0.85, 1.58, p < 0.001; moderate: b = 0.95, 95% C.I. 0.66, 1.24, p < 0.001; and high: b = 0.68, 95% C.I. 0.24, 1.13, p = 0.003).

However, studies regarding the medium to long term impact of COVID-19 on mental health among healthcare workers are limited. Therefore, we conducted this cross-sectional survey to investigate the prevalence, factors and impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 8 months after the end of the outbreak in Wuhan, China. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was delivered as a link via the communication application WeChat to those healthcare workers who worked at several COVID-19 units during the outbreak (from December 2019 to April 2020) in Wuhan, China. The questionnaire included questions on social-demographic data, the post-traumatic stress disorder checklist-5 (PCL-5), the family care index questionnaire (Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection and Resolve, APGAR), and the quality-of-life scale (QOL). The prevalence, risk and protective factors, and impact of PTSD on healthcare workers were subsequently analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 659 participants, 90 healthcare workers were still suffering from PTSD 8 months after the end of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, in which avoidance and negative impact were the most affected dimensions. Suffering from chronic disease, experiencing social isolation, and job dissatisfaction came up as independent risk factors for PTSD, while obtaining COVID-19 related information at an appropriate frequency, good family function, and working in well-prepared mobile cabin hospitals served as protective factors. The impact of PTSD on COVID-19 exposed healthcare workers was apparent by shortened sleeping time, feeling of loneliness, poorer quality of life and intention to resign. CONCLUSIONS: Eight months after the end of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the level of PTSD in healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 was still high. Apart from the commonly recognized risk factors, comorbid chronic disease was identified as a new independent risk factor for developing PTSD. For countries where the pandemic is still ongoing or in case of future outbreaks of new communicable diseases, this study may contribute to preventing cases of PTSD in healthcare workers exposed to infectious diseases under such circumstances.","output":"Prevalence and factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/aims: In an attempt to reduce the impact of COVID-19 and support remote working, many allied healthcare professionals were equipped with video consultation technology To support this new way of working, profession-specific webinars were delivered and attended by over 50% of the total allied healthcare professional workforce in Scotland This study aimed to evaluate the impact of these webinars on the knowledge and confidence of allied health professionals in delivering services via video conferencing Methods: Attendees knowledge and current video conferencing use were ascertained immediately before and after webinars Surveys were also completed at 4 and 8 weeks after the webinar to establish any impact on clinical practice Results: Levels of understanding, knowledge and confidence increased considerably (P&lt;0 001) Follow up at 8 weeks post webinar identified that 75 5% of attendees were using video conferencing, with allied healthcare professional video conferencing activity representing 17% of all national activity by June 2020 Conclusions: Upskilling a diverse and dispersed workforce at pace and scale to enable safe remote working has been critical throughout the pandemic Webinars have proven to be popular with staff to increase their knowledge of and ability to confidently use video conferencing to provide allied healthcare professional services across Scotland","output":"Can webinars support the implementation of video consultations at pace and scale within the allied health professions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unlike the majority of marine mammal species, Hawaiian monk seals (Neomonachus schauinslandi) and West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) reside exclusively in tropical or subtropical waters.

To examine this, we used open-flow respirometry to measure the energy expended during resting and swimming in both species. We found the average resting metabolic rates (RMR) for both the adult monk seal (753.826.1 kJhr-1, means.e.m) and manatees (887.719.5 kJhr-1) were lower than predicted for cold water marine mammal species of similar body mass. Despite these relatively low RMRs, both total cost per stroke and total cost of transport (COTTOT) during submerged swimming were similar to predictions for comparably sized marine mammals (adult monk seal: Cost per stroke=5.00.2 Jkg-1stroke-1, COTTOT=1.70.1 Jkg-1m-1; manatees: Cost per stroke=2.00.4 Jkg-1stroke-11, COTTOT=0.870.17 Jkg-1m-1). These lower maintenance costs result in less variability in adjustable metabolic costs that occur during submergence for warm water species.

However, in the United Kingdom a minority of women use a pool for labour or birth, with pool use particularly uncommon in obstetric-led settings. Maternity unit culture has been identified as an important influence on pool use, but this and other possible factors have not been explored in-depth. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify factors influencing pool use through qualitative case studies of three obstetric units and three midwifery units in the UK. METHODS: Case study units with a range of waterbirth rates and representing geographically diverse locations were selected. Data collection methods comprised semi-structured interviews, collation of service documentation and public-facing information, and observations of the unit environment. There were 111 interview participants, purposively sampled to include midwives, postnatal women, obstetricians, neonatologists, midwifery support workers and doulas. A framework approach was used to analyse all case study data. RESULTS: Obstetric unit culture was a key factor restricting pool use. We found substantial differences between obstetric and midwifery units in terms of equipment and resources, staff attitudes and confidence, senior staff support and womens awareness of water immersion. Generic factors influencing use of pools across all units included limited access to waterbirth training, sociodemographic differences in desire for pool use and issues using waterproof fetal monitoring equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Case study findings provide new insights into the influence of maternity unit culture on waterbirth rates. Access to pool use could be improved through midwives based in obstetric units having more experience of waterbirth, providing obstetricians and neonatologists with information on the practicalities of pool use and improving accessibility of antenatal information. In terms of resources, recommendations include increasing pool provision, ensuring birth room allocation maximises the use of unit resources, and providing pool room environments that are acceptable to midwives.

Galectin-3 is known to play a key role in the inflammation and fibrosis process. We aimed to evaluate the predictive role of Galectin-3 levels for pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Total of 176 patients with COVID-19, confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, admitted to the Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital was analyzed. The study was designed as a cross sectional. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including galectin-3 were collected at the time of diagnosis. CT images evaluated by a single radiologist according to the recommendation of the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Document for pulmonary involvement. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was assessed using the total severity score.

METHODS Healthy pigs were randomized into three groups (standard therapy (ST) alone, ST+No-cell device, ST+SRBAL device) before placement of an implantable intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor and a tunneled central venous catheter. One week later, pigs received bolus infusion of the hepatotoxin D-galactosamine and were followed for up to 90h. RESULTS At 48h, all animals had developed encephalopathy and biochemical changes confirming ALF; extracorporeal treatment was initiated and pigs were observed up to 90h after drug infusion. Pigs treated with the SRBAL, loaded with porcine hepatocyte spheroids, had improved survival (83%, n=6) compared to ST alone (0%, n=6, p=0.003) and No-cell device therapy (17%, n=6, p=0.02). Ammonia detoxification, peak levels of serum ammonia and peak ICP, and pig survival were influenced by hepatocyte cell dose, membrane pore size and duration of SRBAL treatment. Hepatocyte spheroids remained highly functional with no decline in mean oxygen consumption from initiation to completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS The SRBAL improved survival in an allogeneic model of drug-overdose ALF. Survival correlated with ammonia detoxification and ICP lowering indicating that hepatocyte spheroids prevented the cerebral manifestations of ALF (brain swelling, herniation, death).

However, in practice, writing styles vary as reports are not 100% following APA-style or parameters are not reported despite being mandatory. In addition, the statistics are not reported in isolation but in context of experimental conditions investigated and the general topic. We address these challenges by proposing a flexible pipeline STEREO based on active wrapper induction and unsupervised aspect extraction. We applied our pipeline to the over 100,000 documents in the CORD-19 dataset. It required only 0.25% of the corpus (about 500 documents) to learn statistics extraction rules that cover 95% of the sentences in CORD-19. The statistic extraction has nearly 100% precision on APA-conform and 95% precision on non-APA writing styles. In total, we were able to extract 113k reported statistics, of which only<1% is APA conform. We could extract in 46% the correct conditions from APA-conform reports (30% for non-APA). The best model for topic extraction achieves a precision of 75% on statistics reported in APA style (73% for non-APA conform). We conclude that STEREO is a good foundation for automatic statistic extraction and future developments for scientific paper analysis.

Despite several studies that have investigated clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, no data have been reported on the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs). Since VFs may influence cardiorespiratory function and disease outcomes, the aim of this study was to assess VFs prevalence and clinical impact in COVID-19. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at San Raffaele Hospital, a tertiary health care hospital in Italy. We included COVID-19 patients for whom lateral chest x-rays at emergency department were available. VFs were detected using a semiquantitative evaluation of vertebral shape on chest x-rays. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included in this study and thoracic VFs were detected in 41 patients (36%). Patients with VFs were older and more frequently affected by hypertension and coronary artery disease (P < 0.001, P = 0.007, P = 0.034; respectively). Thirty-six (88%) patients in VFs+ group compared to 54 (74%) in VFs? group were hospitalized (P = 0.08). Patients with VFs more frequently required noninvasive mechanical ventilation compared with those without VFs (P = 0.02). Mortality was 22% in VFs+ group and 10% in VFs? group (P = 0.07). In particular, mortality was higher in patients with severe VFs compared with those with moderate and mild VFs (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: VFs may integrate the cardiorespiratory risk of COVID-19 patients, being a useful and easy to measure clinical marker of fragility and poor prognosis.

Moreover, the location of an infected patient within the ward cubicle is crucial in determining the extent of infection risk to other ward occupants. Hence, it is recommended to provide exhaust grilles in close proximity to a patient, preferably above each patients bed. To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested. Regardless of the ventilation design, all patients and any surfaces within a ward cubicle should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to remove microbial contamination.

In the absence of specific antiviral medication, symptomatic treatment and physical isolation remain the options to control the contagion. The recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs highlighted some promising compounds such as umifenovir (haemagglutinin-mediated fusion inhibitor), remdesivir (RdRp nucleoside inhibitor), and favipiravir (RdRp Inhibitor). WHO launched a multinational clinical trial on several promising analogs as a potential treatment to combat SARS infection. This situation urges a holistic approach to invent safe and specific drugs as a prophylactic and therapeutic cure for SARS-related-viral diseases, including COVID-19. It is significant to note that researchers worldwide have been doing their best to handle the crisis and have produced an extensive and promising literature body. It opens a scope and allows understanding the viral entry at the molecular level. A structure-based approach can reveal the molecular-level understanding of viral entry interaction. The ligand profiling and non-covalent interactions among participating amino-acid residues are critical information to delineate a structural interpretation. The structural investigation of SARS virus entry into host cells will reveal the possible strategy for designing drugs like entry inhibitors. The structure-based approach demonstrates details at the 3D molecular level. It shows specificity about SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry, and the human protease completes the process of viral fusion and infection. The 3D structural studies reveal the existence of two units, namely S1 and S2. S1 is called a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and responsible for interacting with the host (ACE2), and the S2 unit participates in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage at S1/S2 subunit interface in S-protein of SARS CoV-2, leading to viral fusion. Conformational difference associated with S1 binding alters ACE2 interaction and inhibits viral fusion.

Recently, endogenous biological melanin pigments have been utilized to develop nanoplatforms due to their excellent biocompatibility and degradability. Whereas, the insufficient capability of PEGylated melanin nanoparticles (PEG-MNPs) in photoacoustic (PA) imaging limits their further biomedical applications. Paradoxically, it is difficult to meet these two different requirements. Herein, a multifunctional nanoagent based on melanin (MNPs) conjugating the near-infrared (NIR) dye IR820 was successfully designed and fabricated. Encapsulation by polyethylene glycol (PEG) renders the solubility in water and allows the physical absorption of IR820 for enhanced photoacoustic (PA) performance and photothermal therapy. Besides, PEG coating on the surface of IR820-PEG-MNPs resulted in a reduction in swallowing in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and spleen, prolonging the circulation time in the blood and increasing the accumulation in the tumor.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the temporal and spatial distributions of 3 infected families in a high-rise apartment building and examine the associated environment variables to verify the role of fecal aerosols. DESIGN: Epidemiologic survey and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses on throat swabs from the participants; 237 surface and air samples from 11 of the 83 flats in the building, public areas, and building drainage systems; and tracer gas released into bathrooms as a surrogate for virus-laden aerosols in the drainage system. SETTING: A high-rise apartment building in Guangzhou, China. PARTICIPANTS: 9 infected patients, 193 other residents of the building, and 24 members of the building's management staff. MEASUREMENTS: Locations of infected flats and positive environmental samples, and spread of virus-laden aerosols. RESULTS: 9 infected patients in 3 families were identified. The first family had a history of travel to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epicenter Wuhan, whereas the other 2 families had no travel history and a later onset of symptoms. No evidence was found for transmission via the elevator or elsewhere. The families lived in 3 vertically aligned flats connected by drainage pipes in the master bathrooms. Both the observed infections and the locations of positive environmental samples are consistent with the vertical spread of virus-laden aerosols via these stacks and vents. LIMITATION: Inability to determine whether the water seals were dried out in the flats of the infected families.

In addition, one of the parameters of our model includes the proportion of infected and tested versus infected. Since there are many factors which have an impact on the evolution of the pandemic, we decide to treat the estimation and the prediction based on the previous 7 days of data, particularly important here being the number of deceased. We perform the estimation and prediction using neural networks in two steps. Firstly, by simulating data with our model, we train several neural networks which learn the parameters of the model. Secondly, we use an ensemble of ten of these neural networks to forecast the parameters from the real data of Covid19 in Romania.

We report that histone H3 lysine 9 di-methylation (K9me2), mediated by histone methyltransferase G9a, regulates the dynamics of lung epithelial progenitor cells, and this regulation deteriorates with age. In aged mouse lungs, K9me2 loss coincided with lower frequency and activity of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell progenitors. In contrast, K9me2 loss resulted in increased frequency and activity of multipotent progenitor cells with bronchiolar and alveolar potential (BASCs) and bronchiolar progenitors. K9me2 depletion in young mice through deletion or inhibition of G9a decreased AT2 progenitor activity and impaired alveolar injury regeneration. Conversely, K9me2 depletion increased chromatin accessibility of bronchiolar cell genes, increased BASC frequency and accelerated bronchiolar repair. K9me2 depletion also resulted in increased bronchiolar cell expression of the SARS-CoV2 receptor Ace2 in aged lungs. These data point to K9me2 and G9a as a critical regulator of the balance of lung progenitor cell regenerative responses and prevention of susceptibility to age-related lung diseases. These findings indicate that epigenetic regulation coordinates progenitor cell populations to expedite regeneration in the most efficient manner and disruption of this regulation presents significant challenges to lung health.","output":"Chromatin alterations in the aging lung change progenitor cell activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in over 100,000 deaths in the USA. Our institution has treated over 2000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacted cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma (MM) population. Herein, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in MM patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma-cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics including the persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-White. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (24%), and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (> 70 years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p < 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-White race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. The median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia was associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These findings pave a path to the identification of vulnerable MM patients who need early intervention to improve outcomes in future outbreaks of COVID-19.","output":"A tertiary center experience of multiple myeloma patients with COVID-19: lessons learned and the path forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world today faces a new challenge that is unprecedented in the last 100 years. The emergence of a new coronavirus has led to a human catastrophe. Scientists in various sciences have been looking for solutions to this problem so far. In addition to general vaccination, maintaining social distance and adherence to government guidelines on safety precaution measures are the most well-known strategies to prevent COVID-19 infection. In this research, we tried to examine the symptoms of COVID-19 cases through different supervised machine learning methods. We solved the class imbalance problem using the synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE) method and then developed some classification models to predict the outcome of COVID-19 cases (recovery or death). Besides, we implemented a rule-based technique to identify different combinations of variables with specific ranges of their values that together affect disease severity. Our results showed that the random forest model with 95.6% accuracy, 97.1% sensitivity, 94.0% specification, 94.4% precision, 95.8% F-score, and 99.3% AUC-score outperforms state-of-the-art classification models. Finally, we identified the most significant rules that state various combinations of 6 features in certain ranges of their values lead to patients recovery with a confidence value of 90%.

Ninety students (66.2% of the cohort) completed the survey. There was overwhelming agreement regarding the immediacy of the problem, with 84.4% of students indicating that We must take action on AMR. Despite more than 94.4% of students correctly defining AMR, specific knowledge regarding AMR impact, contributory causes to AMR and strategies to solve the challenge of AMR was variable. Most students perceived livestock producers to have a significant role in the perpetuation of AMR due to AMU for prophylaxis (71.1% substantial/moderate contribution) and treatment (56.7% substantial/moderate contribution). Over a third of respondents (37.8%) were unsure if AMR could spread from animals to humans. Respondents perceived that various groups (dentists, doctors, veterinarians, professional organisations) are all important in ameliorating the issue of AMR. The implementation of restrictive measures to reduce veterinary prescription of antimicrobials was viewed as less important than strategies involving education, hygiene, surveillance, and guideline development/availability. To encourage the development of good antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) practices, professional veterinary education needs to foster an understanding of the scientific, behavioural and social issues that contribute to AMR and inappropriate AMU, as well as prescribers' personal contribution to AMR perpetuation and amelioration.","output":"Knowledge and perceptions of Australian postgraduate veterinary students prior to formal education of antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous case reports describe the inadvertent administration of methylergonovine to newborns resulting in rare, life-threatening events including neonatal death.

Clinicians are faced with the difficult task of managing patients with PIPH while maintaining the efficacy of antifungal therapy. Commonly, modifications to posaconazole therapy are utilized in managing PIPH, including dosage reduction of posaconazole or switch to an alternative antifungal. OBJECTIVES To characterize the management of patients diagnosed with PIPH and their response to various therapeutic interventions. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 20 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with PIPH. Patient data collected included blood pressure, electrolytes, endocrine laboratory values and posaconazole serum concentrations collected before and after therapeutic intervention. RESULTS Of 20 patients included, 17 patients (85%) underwent therapeutic modification, with posaconazole dose reduction (n = 11) as the most common change. Other modifications included discontinuation (n = 3), switch to an alternative antifungal (n = 2) and addition of spironolactone (n = 1). Clinical improvement (decrease in systolic blood pressure and increase in serum potassium) was observed in 9 of 17 patients (52.9%). An average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 7.1 mmHg and increase in serum potassium of 0.22 mmol/L was observed following therapeutic modification. CONCLUSIONS We report our experience with PIPH management, for which there is no universally effective strategy. We utilized a stepwise approach for management, starting with posaconazole dose reduction and repeat assessment of clinical and laboratory parameters. If resolution of PIPH is not achieved, an alternative triazole antifungal or the addition of an aldosterone antagonist are additional potential interventions.

Biological invasions affect different aspects of life on earth and mandate urgent management actions. Education and public awareness are strongly recommended for successful prevention and management of invasive alien species (IAS). This work presents a study on knowledge and perception of the educational community of Argentina about native species and IAS. We designed an on-line semi-structured questionnaire to examine perception of the environment, recognition of native species and IAS and awareness about biological invasions. Educators recognised an important number of biotic components, mostly represented by trees, birds and mammals. Recognition of native species and IAS, and awareness of biological invasions were different between NST (Natural Science Teachers) and non-NST. Respondents had different performances when they were exposed to recognising native species though written names or photographs. Out of 532 respondents, 56% knew what biological invasions are, 21% answered Maybe and 23% had never heard about them. We need to foster capacity-building and encourage a two-way communication between educators and scientists, formally and informally, to engage the participation of the whole society in recognition, prevention and management of IAS.","output":"The educational community and its knowledge and perceptions of native and invasive alien species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reviews the available information on the different health and animal welfare issues in organic pigs in relation to weaning. It addresses the most relevant health and welfare problems and reviews their potential hazards and associated risk factors. Regarding health, problems related to post weaning diarrhoea, cold stress, skin lesions, endoparasites and post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome are described. Reasons for distress and frustration in weaned piglets are identified as mainly separation from the mother, a new environment, mixing and fear of humans. Finally, hazards and risk factors for health and welfare in organic weaners are related to animal characteristics, housing systems, feed/nutrition and management. Generally, it is concluded that diseases around weaning are multifactorial in nature, with several factors contributing simultaneously as stressors at the time of weaning. In order to solve problems around weaning, the complexity and the individuality of farm systems need to be taken into account.","output":"Animal health, welfare and production problems in organic weaner pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution is a serious issue and it has been becoming increasingly urgent over last year, mainly as a result of its effects on human health. Recently, however, a number of scientific papers has appeared reporting on air pollution effects in other fields such as the photovoltaic energy generation and, notably, on the relation between the reduction of the solar insolation reaching the PV systems and PM(2.5) concentrations in the air. In this study, the rooftop solar PV potential of commercial and industrial (C&I) buildings at regional scale has been estimated tacking into account the spatially distributed solar insolation reduction factor, due to the PM(2.5) in the air. High resolution LiDAR data and advanced digital surface modeling techniques have been used for determining the available suitable rooftop area and estimating the technical solar PV potential of the C&I rooftops. For the C&I study area of Aversa Nord (South Italy), we find that the suitable rooftops have annually a total electric power potential of 50.75 [Formula: see text] . For this area, an annual average PM(2.5) concentrations of about 13 g/m(3) results in a nearly 5% annual solar insolation reduction. Thus, if properly located, the large scale rooftop PV systems could significantly decrease primary energy consumption and contribute to reduce the CO2 emissions.","output":"Estimating Air Pollution Related Solar Insolation Reduction in the Assessment of the Commercial and Industrial Rooftop Solar PV Potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The importance of receiving an annual influenza vaccine among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is well established. With the rapid community spread and the possibility of another wave of COVID-19 infections in the fall, receiving an influenza vaccine is of particular importance to mitigate the risk associated with overlapping influenza and COVID-19 infections. METHODS: We utilized cross-sectional data from the 2016 to 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationally representative U.S. telephone-based survey of adults 18 years or older. Race/ethnicity was our exposure of interest. We assessed the relative difference in influenza vaccination by race/ethnicity for each U.S. state in the overall U.S. population and among those with ASCVD as prevalence of receipt of influenza vaccination among Blacks or Hispanics minus prevalence among Whites divided by prevalence among Whites. We used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models to evaluate the association between socioeconomic risk factors and receipt of influenza vaccination. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 1,747,397 participants of whom 21% were older than 65 years, 51% women, 63% White, 12% Black, 17% Hispanic, and 9% with history of ASCVD. The receipt of influenza vaccine was 38% in the overall population and 51% among those with self-reported ASCVD, which translates to approximately to 97 million and 12 million US adults, respectively. The receipt of influenza vaccine among individuals with ASCVD was 54% for Whites, 45% for Blacks, and 42% for Hispanics (p<0.001). In the overall U.S. population, the median (interquartile range) relative difference for influenza vaccination between Blacks and Whites was 17% (-27%, -9%) and C22% (-29%, -9%) between Hispanics and Whites across all U.S. states. Among individuals with and without ASCVD, Age older than 65 years, greater than college education, higher income, and having a PCP were significantly associated with higher odds of receipt of influenza vaccination, while being employed, lack of healthcare coverage, Black race, and delay in healthcare access were significantly inversely associated with having received an influenza vaccine CONCLUSIONS: Only 50% patients with ASCVD receive influenza vaccines. The receipt of influenza vaccination among individuals with ASCVD is lower among Blacks and Hispanics compared to Whites with significant state-level variation.

METHODS: We performed cell cultures on 193 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction respiratory samples, positive for SARS-CoV-2, obtained from 189 patients at various times, from clinical diagnosis to follow-up. Eleven samples were obtained from asymptomatic individuals, 91 samples from 91 outpatients with mild forms of COVID-19, and 91 samples from 87 inpatients with severe pneumonia. In these patients, neutralising activity was analysed in 30 paired sera collected after symptom onset >10 days. RESULTS: We detected a cytopathic effect (CPE) in 91 (91/193, 47%) samples. Viral viability was maintained for up to 10 days in the patients with mild COVID-19. In the patients with severe COVID-19, the virus remained viable for up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms. Patients with severe COVID-19 presented infectious virus at a significantly higher rate in the samples with moderate to low viral load (cycle threshold value >26): 32/75 (43%) versus 14/63 (22%) for mild cases (P < 0.01). We observed a positive CPE despite the presence of clear neutralising activity (NT50 >1:1024 in 10% (3/30) of samples.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Nasiriyah city (with 79 primary health care facilities), southeastern Iraq. This study has evaluated the VCR in three periods (2018, 2019 and 2020) with multi-level random sampling. Interesting data were extracted from the vaccination card [for BCG, Pentavalent 1, 2, 3, measles and activated OPV 1,2], and any missing data were completed by telephone call with participants' parents (598 children were enrolled). Logistic regression was applied for comparing and estimating Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for association between VCR and related factors. Results: The early period of pandemic (2019) has more declined of the studied vaccines. Among the vaccines studied; BCG has the highest rate in all three periods (100% VCR) and the measles has the lowest rate; that was 83.7% and in 2020 it reached 63.6% (P-value <0.001). The highest OR among all type of vaccine were for city dwellers and date of birth 2020 2.67 (1.39-5.10), 2.34 (1.28-4.28), respectively. Both rates were estimated for Pentavalent-2. Conclusion: The VCR is decreasing during the COVID-19 in Iraq. It is better to adopt new health policies to increase the vaccination coverage rate.

This large international study examined the impact of the pandemic on mental health clinicians telehealth use. METHODS: This survey study was conducted with mental health professionals, primarily psychiatrists and psychologists, registered with WHO's Global Clinical Practice Network (GCPN). 1206 clinicians from 100 countries completed the telehealth section of the online survey in one of six languages between June 4 and July 7, 2020. Participants were asked about their use, training (i.e., aspects of telehealth addressed), perceptions, and concerns. OUTCOMES: Since the pandemic onset, 1092 (90.5%) clinicians reported to have started or increased their telehealth services. Telephone and videoconferencing were the most common modalities. 592 (49.1%) participants indicated that they had not received any training. Clinicians with no training or training that only addressed a single aspect of telehealth practice were more likely to perceive their services as somewhat ineffective than those with training that addressed two or more aspects. Most clinicians indicated positive perceptions of effectiveness and patient satisfaction. Quality of care compared to in-person services and technical issues were the most common concerns. Findings varied by WHO region, country income level, and profession. INTERPRETATION: Findings suggest a global practice change with providers perceiving telehealth as a viable option for mental health care.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the utility of brief social contactCbased video interventions of transgender protagonists with depression to reduce transphobia and depression-related stigma and increase treatment-seeking intentions among adolescents in the general population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: During August 2021, a total of 1437 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 video-based conditions in a 2:2:1:1 ratio: (1) transgender adolescent girls, (2) transgender adolescent boys, (3) cisgender adolescent girls, or (4) cisgender adolescent boys. INTERVENTIONS: In each of the approximately 110-second videos, an empowered presenter shared their personal story about coping with depression and reaching out for help. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the score on the Attitudes Toward Transgender Men and Women (ATTMW) scale. Secondary outcomes were (1) a gender thermometer rating for warmth in transgender perception, (2) the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS) score, and (3) the General Health-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ) score. RESULTS: Of the 1437 randomized participants, 1098 (76%) completed the postintervention assessment and passed all the validity tests (mean [SD] age, 16.9 [1.2] years; 481 [44%] male; 640 [58%] White). A significant change in attitudes toward transgender youth was found within the intervention group only (mean [SD] ATTMW scores: intervention group, 34.6 [23.1] at baseline to 32.8 [24.2] after intervention; P < .001; control group, 33.5 [23.4] at baseline to 32.4 [24.1] after intervention; P = .01). The mean (SD) total DSS scores decreased significantly across study groups (intervention: 1.3 [3.3]; control: 1.7 [3.3]; P < .001). A significant increase in intention to seek help from a parent was found in the intervention (mean [SD] GHSQ score, 0.2 [1.1]) and control (mean [SD] GHSQ score, 0.3 [1.2]) groups (P < .001), as was a decrease in those not wanting to seek help from anyone (mean [SD] GHSQ score: intervention, 0.2 [1.6], P = .009; control, 0.3 [1.2], P < .001) Secondary analyses revealed significant differences in baseline ATTMW scores and intervention effects between transgender and gender-diverse and cisgender participants and between lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (LGBQ) and straight participants (F = 36.7, P < .001) and heterosexual participants (F = 37.0, P < .001). A significant difference was also found in mean (SD) transgender warmth scores from baseline to after intervention between groups (2.6 [13.1] in the intervention group vs 0.4 [8.3] in the control group; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, brief social contactCbased videos proved efficacious in reducing transphobia and depression-related stigma and in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among adolescents in the general population. By personifying, individualizing, and providing face and voice to the experience of transgender youth, other adolescents, especially those who are cisgender and/or of a heterosexual orientation, can gain empathetic insights into the lives of their often marginalized and stigmatized fellow youth.

Our findings indicate that not only do these users share a high volume of legitimate phishing URLs, but these reports contain more information regarding the phishing websites (which can expedite the process of identifying and removing these threats), when compared to two popular open-source phishing feeds: PhishTank and OpenPhish. We also notice that the reported websites had very little overlap with the URLs existing in the other feeds, and also remained active for longer periods of time. But despite having these attributes, we found that these reports have very low interaction from other Twitter users, especially from the domains and organizations targeted by the reported URLs. Moreover, nearly 31% of these URLs were still active even after a week of them being reported, with 27% of them being detected by very few anti-phishing tools, suggesting that a large majority of these reports remain undiscovered, despite the majority of the follower base of these accounts being security focused users.

Single-aspect approaches, such as accessibility and spatial hazard analyses, have not been widely applied in suitability assessments on the location of educational facilities. Model development was performed based on analyses of the economic value of the land and on the integration of various parameters across three main aspects: accessibility, comfort, and a multi-natural/biohazard (disaster) risk index. Based on the maps of disaster hazards, higher flood-prone areas are found to be in gentle slopes and located in large cities. Higher risks of landslides are spread throughout the study area, while higher levels of earthquake risk are predominantly in the south, close to the active faults and megathrusts present. Presently, many schools are located in very high vulnerability zones (2057 elementary, 572 junior high, 157 senior high, and 313 vocational high schools). The comfort-level map revealed 13,459 schools located in areas with very low and low comfort levels, whereas only 2377 schools are in locations of high or very high comfort levels. Based on the school accessibility map, higher levels are located in the larger cities of West Java, whereas schools with lower accessibility are documented far from these urban areas. In particular, senior high school accessibility is predominant in areas of lower accessibility levels, as there are comparatively fewer facilities available in West Java. Overall, higher levels of suitability are spread throughout West Java. These distribution results revealed an expansion of the availability of schools by area: senior high schools, 303,973.1 ha;vocational high schools, 94,170.51 ha;and junior high schools, 12,981.78 ha.

STUDY DESIGN: By using a convenience sampling approach, 129 out of 205 randomly selected healthcare professionals from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were invited to take part in a WeChat messaging app survey, Questionnaire Star, via a survey link. Healthcare personnel details were collected, including profession, years of professional experience and adverse reactions while wearing L3PPE. Survey results were divided by profession and years of professional experience; differences in adverse reactions were compared. RESULTS: Among the 129 healthcare professionals surveyed, 21 (16.28%) were doctors and 108 (83.72%) were nurses. A total of 122 (94.57%) healthcare professionals experienced discomfort while wearing L3PPE to treat patients with COVID-19. The main reasons for adverse reactions and discomfort include varying degrees of adverse skin reactions, respiratory difficulties, heat stress, dizziness and nausea. Doctors had a lower incidence of rashes ((2)=4.519, p=0.034) and dizziness ((2)=4.123, p=0.042) when compared with nurses. Junior (8.5 years of experience or fewer) healthcare personnel also experienced a higher rate of heat stress when compared with senior personnel (more than 8.5 years greater) ((2)=5.228, p=0.022). CONCLUSION: More attention should be offered to healthcare personnel wearing L3PPE to treat patients with COVID-19 because they are susceptible to developing adverse reactions.","output":"Investigation of adverse reactions in healthcare personnel working in Level 3 barrier protection PPE to treat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic poses novel health issues.

Its integrity is often compromised due to mechanical, chemical, or infectious causes. Opportunistic bacterial pathogens are poised to cause parenchymal infection and become difficult to eradicate due to adaptive metabolic changes, biofilm formation, and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance and fitness genes. Enhancing mucosal defenses by modulating the cytokines that regulate barrier functions, such as interleukin-22 (IL-22) and interferon-&#955; (IFN-&#955;), members of the IL-10 family of cytokines, is an attractive approach to prevent these infections that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. These cytokines both signal through the cognate receptor IL-10RB, have related protein structures and common downstream signaling suggesting shared roles in host respiratory defense. They are typically co-expressed in multiple models of infections, but with differing kinetics. IL-22 has an important role in the producing antimicrobial peptides, upregulating expression of junctional proteins in the airway epithelium and working in concert with other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17. Conversely, IFN-&#955;, a potent antiviral in influenza infection with pro-inflammatory properties, appears to decrease junctional integrity allowing for bacterial and immune cell translocation. The effects of these cytokines are pleotropic, with pathogen and tissue specific consequences.

Internationally, governments are enforcing measures such as travel bans, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing leading to an extended period of time at home. This has resulted in reductions in physical activity and changes in dietary intakes that have the potential to accelerate sarcopenia, a deterioration of muscle mass and function (more likely in older populations), as well as increases in body fat. These changes in body composition are associated with a number of chronic, lifestyle diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, osteoporosis, frailty, cognitive decline, and depression. Furthermore, CVD, diabetes, and elevated body fat are associated with greater risk of COVID-19 infection and more severe symptomology, underscoring the importance of avoiding the development of such morbidities. Here we review mechanisms of sarcopenia and their relation to the current data on the effects of COVID-19 confinement on physical activity, dietary habits, sleep, and stress as well as extended bed rest due to COVID-19 hospitalization. The potential of these factors to lead to an increased likelihood of muscle loss and chronic disease will be discussed. By offering a number of home-based strategies including resistance exercise, higher protein intakes and supplementation, we can potentially guide public health authorities to avoid a lifestyle disease and rehabilitation crisis post-COVID-19. Such strategies may also serve as useful preventative measures for reducing the likelihood of sarcopenia in general and in the event of future periods of isolation.","output":"Sarcopenia during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions: long-term health effects of short-term muscle loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most studies of severe/fatal COVID-19 risk have used routine/hospitalisation data without detailed pre-morbid characterisation.

Treatment options are limited, particularly for anxiety. The aim of this study was to update our previous systematic review (2014) and evaluate via meta-analysis the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for improving mental well-being in PwMS. METHODS Systematic searches for eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were carried out in seven major databases (November 2017, July 2018), using medical subject headings and key words. Studies were screened, data extracted, quality appraised and analysed by two independent reviewers, using predefined criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Mental well-being was the primary outcome. Random effects model meta-analysis was performed, with effect size reported as standardised mean difference (SMD). RESULTS Twelve RCTs including 744 PwMS were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review, eight had data extractable for meta-analysis; n=635. Ethnicity, socioeconomic status, comorbidity and disability were inconsistently reported. MBIs varied from manualised to tailored versions, lasting 6-9 weeks, delivered individually and via groups, both in person and online. Overall SMD for mental well-being (eight studies) was 0.40 (0.28-0.53), p<0.01, I2=28%; against active comparators only (three studies) SMD was 0.17 (0.01-0.32), p<0.05, I2 =0%.

To examine the anti-viral and/or regulatory role of interferon- (IFN-) signaling in the cell that synthesizes and maintains the myelin sheath, we analyzed JHMV pathogenesis in transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative IFN- receptor on oligodendroglia. Defective IFN- signaling was associated with enhanced oligodendroglial tropism and delayed virus clearance. However, the CNS inflammatory cell composition and CD8(+) T-cell effector functions were similar between transgenic and wild-type mice, supporting unimpaired peripheral and CNS immune responses in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, increased viral load in oligodendroglia did not affect the extent of myelin loss, the frequency of oligodendroglial apoptosis, or CNS recruitment of macrophages. These data demonstrate that IFN- receptor signaling is critical for the control of JHMV replication in oligodendroglia. In addition, the absence of a correlation between increased oligodendroglial infection and the extent of demyelination suggests a complex pathobiology of myelin loss in which infection of oligodendroglia is required but not sufficient.","output":"Inhibition of Interferon- Signaling in Oligodendroglia Delays Coronavirus Clearance without Altering Demyelination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first cases of COVID-19 in Londrina-PR were manifested in March 2020 and the disease lasts until the present moment.

Thoracic computed tomography was normal, and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab was negative. Because of haemodynamic worsening with both an increase in cardiac troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide levels and normal electrocardiogram, acute myocarditis was suspected. Cardiac echographic examination showed left ventricular ejection fraction at 45%. Exhaustive diagnostic workup included RT-PCR and serologies for infectious agents and autoimmune blood tests as well as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and endomyocardial biopsies. Cardiac magnetic resonance with T2 mapping sequences showed evidence of myocardial inflammation and focal lateral subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement. Pathological analysis exhibited interstitial oedema, small foci of necrosis, and infiltrates composed of plasmocytes, T-lymphocytes, and mainly CD163+ macrophages.

Within the Nox family only Nox4 produces H2O2 which can directly oxidize cysteine residues. With this post-translational modification, activity, stability, localization and protein-protein interactions of the affected protein is altered. Nox4 controls differentiation, cellular homeostasis and prevents inflammation. Therefore, is likely that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the effects of Nox4. One group of epigenetic modifiers are class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs). We hypothesize that Nox4-derived H2O2 oxidizes HDACs and analyzed whether HDACs can be differentially oxidized by Nox4. As an artificial system, we utilized HEK293 cells, overexpressing Nox4 in a tetracycline-inducible manner. HDAC4 was oxidized upon Nox4 overexpression. Additionally, Nox4 overexpression increased HDAC4 phosphorylation on Ser632. H2O2 disrupted HDAC4/Mef2A complex, which de-represses Mef2A. In endothelial cells such as HUVECs and HMECs, overexpression of HDAC4 significantly reduced tube formation. Overexpression of a redox insensitive HDAC4 had no effect on endothelial tube formation. Treatment with H2O2, induction of Nox4 expression by treatment of the cells with TGF and co-overexpression of Nox4 not only induced phosphorylation of HDAC4, but also restored the repressive effect of HDAC4 for tube formation, while overexpression of a redox dead mutant of Nox4 did not. Taken together, Nox4 oxidizes HDAC4, increases its phosphorylation, and eventually ensures proper tube formation by endothelial cells.","output":"Oxidation of HDAC4 by Nox4-derived H2O2 maintains tube formation by endothelial cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individual household emergency planning is the most fundamental and can be the least expensive way to prepare for natural disasters.

This article outlines the faculties in Germany where DiCo are already integrated into medical education. Methods: Courses with DiCo as teaching content were collected by a literature research on Pubmed and Google as well as by contacting all dean's offices and other persons responsible for teaching at German medical faculties. The courses were summarized in a table. Results: In a first survey, 16 universities were identified that offer courses on DiCo. In the elective area at the universities, 17 courses and in the compulsory area eight courses could be identified. The scope and content of the courses diverged between compulsory curricula, integrated courses of different lengths, and elective courses that are one-time or longitudinally integrated. The topics taught are heterogeneous and include fundamentals of medical informatics such as data management on the one hand and a collection of e.g. ethics, law, apps, artificial intelligence, telemedicine and robotics on the other hand.

Design Video presentation of surgical techniques. Setting University hospital. Patients or Participants Three patients with endometriosis obstructing the ureter(s). Interventions A bipolar grasper, wristed needle drivers, and scissors with monopolar energy were used. Additional ports were inserted due to the complexity of the operation. Entry was made at the umbilicus and carried down into the abdominal cavity, and the pelvis was inspected for endometriosis lesions. The first patient was a 38-year-old G0P0 with an absent right kidney and ureter from a congenital Mullerian fusion defect who complained of one-year duration of pelvic pain. Superficial endometriosis nodules were identified on the left ureter. The lesions were trimmed with cold scissors to avoid thermal damage. The second patient was a 44-year-old G1P1001 who presented with left kidney failure following a longstanding history of chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis with urinary symptoms. Multiple gynecologic procedures were required, including resection of bilateral deep-infiltrating endometriosis lesions, total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and lysis of adhesions. Structured segments of the left ureter were excised and then left ureteroneocystostomy was carried out. The third patient was a 33-year-old G0P0 with recurrent Stage IV endometriosis who had bilateral ureteral strictures. Bilateral robotic laparoscopic ureterolysis and ureteroneocystostomy were indicated. Notably, for the anastomosis, the bladder was sufficiently mobilized and a Psoas hitch was performed on the right to ensure no tension at the repair site.

Bindin isolated from the sperm acrosome results in insoluble particles that cause homospecific eggs to aggregate, whereas no aggregation occurs with heterospecific eggs. Therefore, Bindin is concluded to play a critical role in fertilization, yet its function has never been tested. Here we report that Cas9-mediated inactivation of the bindin gene in a sea urchin results in perfectly normal-looking embryos, larvae, adults, and gametes in both males and females. What differed between the genotypes was that the bindin -/- sperm never fertilized an egg, functionally validating Bindin as an essential gamete interaction protein at the level of sperm-egg cell surface binding.","output":"Bindin is essential for fertilization in the sea urchin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rustrela virus (RusV; species Rubivirus strelense) is a recently discovered relative of rubella virus (RuV) that has been detected in cases of encephalitis in diverse mammals. Here, we diagnosed two additional cases of fatal RusV-associated meningoencephalitis in a South American coati (Nasua nasua) and a Eurasian or European otter (Lutra lutra) that were detected in a zoological garden with history of prior RusV infections. Both animals showed abnormal movement or unusual behavior and their brains tested positive for RusV using specific reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and RNA in situ hybridization. As previous sequencing of the RusV genome proved to be very challenging, we employed a sophisticated target-specific capture enrichment with specifically designed RNA baits to generate complete RusV genome sequences from both detected encephalitic animals and apparently healthy wild yellow-necked field mice (Apodemus flavicollis). Furthermore, the technique was used to revise three previously published RusV genomes from two encephalitic animals and a wild yellow-necked field mouse. When comparing the newly generated RusV sequences to the previously published RusV genomes, we identified a previously undetected stretch of 309 nucleotides predicted to represent the intergenic region and the sequence encoding the N terminus of the capsid protein. This indicated that the original RusV sequence was likely incomplete due to misassembly of the genome at a region with an exceptionally high G+C content of >80 mol%. The new sequence data indicate that RusV has an overall genome length of 9,631 nucleotides with the longest intergenic region (290 nucleotides) and capsid protein-encoding sequence (331 codons) within the genus Rubivirus. IMPORTANCE The detection of rustrela virus (RusV)-associated encephalitis in two carnivoran mammal species further extends the knowledge on susceptible species. Furthermore, we provide clinical and pathological data for the two new RusV cases, which were until now limited to the initial description of this fatal encephalitis. Using a sophisticated enrichment method prior to sequencing of the viral genome, we markedly improved the virus-to-background sequence ratio compared to that of standard procedures. Consequently, we were able to resolve and update the intergenic region and the coding region for the N terminus of the capsid protein of the initial RusV genome sequence. The updated putative capsid protein now resembles those of rubella and ruhugu virus in size and harbors a predicted RNA-binding domain that had not been identified in the initial RusV genome version. The newly determined complete RusV genomes strongly improve our knowledge of the genome structure of this novel rubivirus.","output":"Revisiting Rustrela Virus: New Cases of Encephalitis and a Solution to the Capsid Enigma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2012 Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) provided validated support for three levels of initial arterial hypoxaemia that correlated with mortality in patients receiving ventilatory support.

METHODS: We analysed the total visits and discharge rates during periods of using the nebulizer and current pMDI\\\\VMMS methods. The acceptance of pMDI\\\\VMMS by patients and assistant medical officers (AMOs) were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We analysed 3184 ED visits and responses from 103 patients and 32 AMOs.

As a result, hospitals must effectively decontaminate and contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in constructed and deconstructed ICUs that care for patients with COVID-19. We assessed decontamination of a COVID-19 ICU and examined the containment efficacy of combined contact and droplet precautions in creating and maintaining a SARS-CoV-2-negative ICU \\"antechamber\\". Methods: To examine the efficacy of chemical decontamination, we used high-density, semi-quantitative environmental sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces in a COVID-19 ICU and COVID-19 ICU antechamber. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure viral RNA on surfaces. Viral location mapping revealed the distribution of viral RNA in the COVID-19 ICU and COVID-19 ICU antechamber. Results were further assessed using loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Results: We collected 224 surface samples pre-decontamination and 193 samples post-decontamination from a COVID-19 ICU and adjoining COVID-19 ICU antechamber. We found that 46% of antechamber objects were positive for SARS-CoV-2 pre-decontamination despite the construction of a swinging door barrier system, implementation of contact precautions, and installation of high-efficiency particulate air filters. The object positivity rate reduced to 32.1% and viral particle rate reduced by 95.4% following decontamination. Matched items had an average of 432.2  2729 viral copies/cm2 pre-decontamination and 19.2  118 viral copies/cm2 post-decontamination, demonstrating significantly reduced viral surface distribution (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Environmental sampling is an effective method for evaluating decontamination protocols and validating measures used to contain SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. While chemical decontamination effectively removes detectable viral RNA from surfaces, our approach to droplet/contact containment with an antechamber was not highly effective.

Respondents expressed a range of concerns centered on balancing professional and family responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, the authors propose several recommendations in the areas of support networks, leadership and culture, and operations and logistics that health care institutions can adopt to minimize the burden on these vulnerable households during states of emergency. The successful implementation of these recommendations hinges on creating a work environment in which all health care providers feel comfortable voicing their concerns.","output":"A Broader View of Risk to Health Care Workers: Perspectives on Supporting Vulnerable Health Care Professional Households During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant cuticles are a mixture of crystalline and amorphous waxes that restrict the exchange of molecules between the plant and the atmosphere. The multicomponent nature of cuticular waxes complicates the study of the relationship between the physical and transport properties. Here, a model cuticle based on the epicuticular waxes of Petunia hybrida flower petals was formulated to test the effect of wax composition on diffusion of water and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The model cuticle was composed of a n-tetracosane (C24 H50 ), 1-docosanol (C22 H45 OH), and 3-methylbutyl dodecanoate (C17 H34 O2 ), reflecting the relative chain length, functional groups, molecular arrangements, and crystallinity of the natural waxes. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to obtain diffusion coefficients for compounds moving through waxes of varying composition. Simulated VOC diffusivities of the model system were found to highly correlate with in vtiro measurements in isolated petunia cuticles. VOC diffusivity increased up to 30-fold in completely amorphous waxes, indicating a significant effect of crystallinity on cuticular permeability. The crystallinity of the waxes was highly dependent on the elongation of the lattice length and decrease in gap width between crystalline unit cells. Diffusion of water and higher molecular weight VOCs were significantly affected by alterations in crystalline spacing and lengths, whereas the low molecular weight VOCs were less affected. Comparison of measured diffusion coefficients from atomistic simulations and emissions from petunia flowers indicates that the role of the plant cuticle in the VOC emission network is attributed to the differential control on mass transfer of individual VOCs by controlling the composition, amount, and dynamics of scent emission.","output":"Diffusion of Volatile Organics and Water in the Epicuticular Waxes of Petunia Petal Epidermal Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To analyze the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice about COVID-19 among Chinese residents, noninterventional and anonymous survey was carried out with an online questionnaire.

Stepwise addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain requires the coordinated movement of mRNA and tRNAs through the ribosome, a process known as translocation. Here, we review current understanding of the kinetics and mechanics of translocation, with particular emphasis on the structure of a functional mammalian ribosome stalled during translocation by an mRNA pseudoknot. In the context of a pseudoknot-stalled complex, the translocase EF-2 is seen to compress a hybrid-state tRNA into a strained conformation. We propose that this strain energy helps overcome the kinetic barrier to translocation and drives tRNA into the P-site, with EF-2 biasing this relaxation in one direction. The tRNA can thus be considered a molecular spring and EF-2 a Brownian ratchet in a spring-and-ratchet system within the translocation process.","output":"The Mechanics of Translocation: A Molecular Spring-and-Ratchet System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Face  la progression rapide de la pandmie lie au COVID-19, les professionnels de sant sont en premire ligne dans la prise en charge des patients et eux-mmes exposs au risque de contamination et maintenant dpuisement. ?

In this case series, we sought to characterize the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a home-based visual rehabilitation program in hemianopia patients using immersive virtual-reality stimulation. Subjects/Methods: Two patients, one with homonymous hemianopia and the other with bitemporal hemianopia, consecutive to pediatric brain tumors, with no prior visual rehabilitation performed 15 min of home-based audiovisual stimulation every 2 days for 6 weeks (case 2) and 7 weeks (case 1) between February and August 2020. Patients used a virtual-reality, stand-alone, and remotely controlled device loaded with a non-commercial audiovisual stimulation program managed in real time from the laboratory. Standard visual outcomes assessed in usual care in visual rehabilitation were measured at the clinic. Following a mixed method approach in this pragmatic study of two cases, we collected quantitative and qualitative data on feasibility and potential effectiveness and compared the results pre- and post-treatment. Results: Implementation and wireless delivery of the audiovisual stimulation, remote data collection, and analysis for cases 1 and 2 who completed 19/20 and 20/20 audiovisual stimulation sessions at home, respectively, altogether indicated feasibility. Contrast sensitivity increased in both eyes for cases 1 and 2. Visual fields, measured by binocular Esterman and monocular Humphrey full-field analyses, improved in case 1. A minor increase was observed in case 2. Cases 1 and 2 enhanced reading speed. Case 2 strongly improved quality of life scores.

The expression level of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is vital for viral infection. However, the regulation of ACE2 expression on the ocular surface is still unknown. We aimed to determine the change in ACE2 expression in inflamed corneal epithelium and explore potential drugs to reduce the expression of ACE2 on the ocular surface. Methods: The expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) was examined by qPCR and Western blotting. The altered expression of ACE2 in inflammatory corneal epithelium was evaluated in TNF&#945;- and IL-1?-stimulated HCECs and inflamed mouse corneal epithelium, and the effect of resveratrol on ACE2 expression in HCECs was detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Results: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed on the human corneal epithelial cells. ACE2 expression is upregulated in HCECs by stimulation with TNF&#945; and IL-1? and inflamed mouse corneas, including dry eye and alkali-burned corneas. In addition, resveratrol attenuates the increased expression of ACE2 induced by TNF&#945; in HCECs. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that ACE2 is highly expressed in HCECs and can be upregulated by stimulation with inflammatory cytokines and inflamed mouse corneal epithelium. Resveratrol may be able to reduce the increased expression of ACE2 on the inflammatory ocular surface.

PubMed, LitCovid, ProQuest, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant studies from 1 April 2021 with a cutoff date of 31 January 2022. The literature search indicated that gustatory dysfunction and saliva secretory dysfunction are prevalent in COVID-19 patients and both dysfunctions persist after recovery from the disease, suggesting the pathogenic mechanism common to these cooccurring symptoms. COVID-19 patients are characterized by hypozincemia, in which zinc is possibly redistributed from blood to the liver at the expense of zinc in other tissues. If COVID-19 induces intracellular zinc deficiency, the activity of zinc-metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase localized in taste buds and salivary glands may be influenced to adversely affect gustatory and saliva secretory functions. Zinc-binding metallothioneins and zinc transporters, which cooperatively control cellular zinc homeostasis, are expressed in oral tissues participating in taste and saliva secretion. Their expression dysregulation associated with COVID-19-induced zinc deficiency may have some effect on oral functions.

Juss. Ex Kunth is widely used in folk medicine. In ethnomedicine, it is applied as a cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, antiarthritic, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial. The aqueous extract is considered antidiabetic, and is used as a traditional remedy in Mexico. More than 120 chemical constituents have been identified in its leaves, barks, and roots. However, less is known about the phytochemical properties of T. stans flower extracts. The herbal plant Nervilia concolor (Blume) Schltr. is native to Vietnam, and is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat diseases such as bronchitis, stomatitis, acute pneumonia, and laryngitis. Only two previous reports have addressed the chemical content of this plant. Bouea macrophylla Griff., commonly known as marian plum or plum mango, is a tropical plant that is used to treat a range of illnesses. Phytochemical analysis of B. macrophylla suggests the presence of volatile components and flavonoids. However, existing data have been obtained from screening without isolation. As part of our ongoing search for alpha-glucosidase inhibitors from Vietnamese medicinal plants, we conducted bioactive-guided isolation of the whole plant N. concolor, the flowers of T. stans, and the leaves of B. macrophylla. We isolated and structurally elucidated five known compounds from T. stans: ursolic acid (TS1), 3-oxours-12-en-28-oic acid (TS2), chrysoeriol (TS3), ferulic acid (TS4), and tecomine (TS5).

Excessive accumulation of saturated fatty acids can increase the substrates of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in hepatocytes and cause the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, impaired triphosphate (ATP) production, and fracture and fragmentation of mitochondria, which ultimately leads to hepatocellular inflammatory injuries, apoptosis, and necrosis. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of empagliflozin on lipotoxicity in palmitic acid-treated LO2 cell lines. We found that empagliflozin protected hepatocytes and inhibited palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress, improving mitochondrial functions, and attenuating apoptosis and inflammation responses. The mechanistic study indicated that empagliflozin significantly activated adenosine 5-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK) through Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CAMKK2) instead of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) or TGF-beta activated kinase (TAK1). The activation of empagliflozin on AMPK not only promoted FoxO3a phosphorylation and thus forkhead box O 3a (FoxO3a) nuclear translocation, but also promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, empagliflozin significantly upregulated the expressions of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and HO-1. In addition, empagliflozin did not attenuate lipid accumulation at all. These results indicated that empagliflozin mitigated lipotoxicity in saturated fatty acid-induced hepatocytes, likely by promoting antioxidant defense instead of attenuating lipid accumulation through enhanced FoxO3a and Nrf2 nuclear translocation dependent on the CAMKK2/AMPK pathway. The CAMKK2/AMPK pathway might serve as a promising target in treatment of lipotoxicity in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.","output":"Empagliflozin-Enhanced Antioxidant Defense Attenuates Lipotoxicity and Protects Hepatocytes by Promoting FoxO3a- and Nrf2-Mediated Nuclear Translocation via the CAMKK2/AMPK Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Assess the effect of a protocol of preoperative erythropoietin (EPO) and ferrous sulfate in addition to perioperative tranexamic acid (TXA) on blood transfusions in patients with coronal or metopic craniosynostosis undergoing cranial vault remodeling (CVR) with fronto-orbital advancement (FOA).

Since their discovery, bacteriophages have been considered an important weapon to fight human and animal infections of bacterial origin due to their specific ability to attack the associated target bacteria. With the discovery of antibiotics, phage treatment was progressively abandoned in Western countries. However, due to the recent emergence of growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to antibiotics, interest in phage use in human therapy has once again grown. Similarly, at the environmental level, the extensive use of disinfectants based on chemicals, including biocides in agriculture, has been associated with the emergence of resistance against disinfectants themselves, besides having a high environmental impact. Due to these issues, the applications of phages with biocontrol purposes have become an interesting option in several fields, including farms, food industry, agriculture, aquaculture and wastewater plants. Notably, phage action is maintained even when the target bacteria are multidrug resistant (MDR), rendering this option extremely interesting in counteracting AMR emergence both for therapeutical and decontamination purposes. Based on this, bacteriophages have been interestingly proposed as environmental routine sanitizers in hospitals, to counteract the spread of the pathogenic MDR bacteria that persistently contaminate hard surfaces.

In October 2020, all 3 Malayan tigers at a Tennessee AZA accredited zoo were diagnosed with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated to determine source and prevent further transmission. METHODS: Tiger nasal swab specimens were tested at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). An environmental assessment at the zoo was completed. We interviewed 18 staff who interacted with the tigers during the 2 weeks before animal symptom onset. Confirmed human cases were defined as persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR during September 28COctober 29, with tiger interaction during their 14-day incubation period. Interviewed staff had repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serum IgG testing on October 29. Tigers and staff testing positive had specimens sent to CDC for genomic sequencing. Tiger sequences were compared phylogenetically with 30 geographically associated human cases collected within 2 weeks of the outbreak and > 200 background sequences from TN. RESULTS: NVSL confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in all 3 tigers. Environmental assessment identified fencing between humans and animals allowing airflow and an open outdoor exhibit observation point above the habitat. Confirmed cases were identified in a tiger keeper and veterinary assistant; both developed symptoms after exposure to symptomatic tigers and one sample was genotyped. Staff did not report known contact with ill visitors. All staff were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The tigers and most temporally and geographically associated cases had genetic sequences in clade 20G and B.1.2. Tiger sequences were 3-6 single nucleotide polymorphisms different from the positive tiger keeper (Figure). Figure. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis. [Image: see text] Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis from a portion of clade 20G showing divergence estimates from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome with sequences from humans living in Tennessee and Malayan tigers sampled during the outbreak investigation in October 2020.

Differences are indicated by one-step edges (lines) between colored dots (individual SARS-CoV-2 sequenced infections). Numbers indicate unique sequences. Note not all analyzed sequences are shown in this figure. CONCLUSION: Using a One Health approach, we concluded the index tiger was likely infected via transmission from an ill visitor at an exhibit observation point or unidentified asymptomatic staff.

We aimed to identify factors contributing to outcome measures in patients treated with the Surpass flow diverter for aneurysms in this location. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted an observational study of 53 patients who underwent flow-diverter treatment for posterior circulation aneurysms at 15 centers. Key outcome measures were mortality, complete aneurysm occlusion, and modified Rankin Scale score at follow-up. RESULTS At follow-up (median, 11.3 months; interquartile range, 5.9-12.7 months), 9 patients had died, resulting in an all-cause mortality rate of 17.3% (95% CI, 7%-27.6%); 7 deaths (14%) were directly related to the procedure and none occurred in patients with a baseline mRS score of zero. After adjusting for covariates, a baseline mRS of 3-5 was more significantly (P = .003) associated with a higher hazard ratio for death than a baseline mRS of 0-2 (hazard ratio, 17.11; 95% CI, 2.69-109.02). After adjusting for follow-up duration, a 1-point increase in the baseline mRS was significantly (P < .001) associated with higher values of mRS at follow-up (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.79-4.79). Follow-up angiography in 44 patients (median, 11.3 months; interquartile range, 5.9-12.7 months) showed complete aneurysm occlusion in 29 (66%; 95% CI, 50.1%-79.5%). CONCLUSIONS Clinical results of flow-diverter treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms depend very much on patient selection. In this study, poorer outcomes were related to the treatment of aneurysms in patients with higher baseline mRS scores. Angiographic results showed a high occlusion rate for this subset of complex aneurysms.","output":"Surpass Flow Diverter for Treatment of Posterior Circulation Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence of childhood adversity among healthcare workers and if such experiences affect responses to adult life stress. METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted of a 2003 study of 176 hospital-based healthcare workers, which surveyed lifetime traumatic events, recent life events, psychological distress, coping, social support, and days off work due to stress or illness. RESULTS: Sixty eight percent (95% CI 61.1C74.9) of healthcare workers had one or more experience of violence, abuse or neglect, 33% (95% CI 26.1C40.0) before the age of 13. Compared to healthcare workers who did not experience childhood adversity, those who did reported more recent life events (median 11 vs. 5 over the previous 6 months, p < .001) and greater psychological distress (median score 17 vs. 13, p < .001). The relationship between life events and psychological distress was not linear. Most healthcare workers without childhood adversity (73%) reported a low number of life events which were not associated with psychological distress. Most healthcare workers with childhood adversity (81%) reported a higher number of life events, for which the correlation between events and distress was moderately strong (Spearman's rho = .50, p < .001). Childhood adversity was also associated with more missed work days. Each of these outcomes was higher in 22 healthcare workers (13%) who had experienced more than one type of childhood adversity.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed social distancing (SD) as a prudent measure to contain the pandemic and, hence, governments have been enacting lockdowns of varied nature. These lockdowns, causing economic and social strain, warrant the development of quantitative models to optimally manage the pandemic. Similarly, extensive testing aids in early detection and isolation, hence containing the spread of the pandemic. Compartment epidemiology models have been used extensively in modeling such infectious diseases. This paper attempts to utilize the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model incorporating the SD, testing, and infectiousness of exposed and infectious compartments to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has put restrictions on the movement of people in different phases to ascertain SD. Time-dependent parameters based on the timeline of restrictions and testing in Saudi Arabia have been introduced to capture SD and testing. The arrived model has been validated through statistical tests. The [Formula: see text] (R naught), basic reproduction number, value has ranged between 0.6014 and 2.7860 with an average of 1.4904 and currently holds at 0.8952. In the absence of SD and testing measures, the model predicts the threshold herd immunity to be 69.31% and [Formula: see text] value as 3.26. Further, scenario analysis has been conducted for alleviating the SD measure. The results show that early lifting of all restrictions may undo all efforts in the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, these strategies rely on community understanding and motivation to engage to ensure appropriate compliance and impact. To support current activities for COVID-19, the objectives of this narrative review was to identify the key determinants impacting on engagement. METHODS: An integrative narrative literature review focused on NPIs. We aimed to identify published peer-reviewed articles that focused on the general community (excluding healthcare workers), NPIs (including school closure, quarantine, isolation, physical distancing and hygiene behaviours), and factors/characteristics (including social, physical, psychological, capacity, motivation, economic and demographic) that impact on engagement. RESULTS: The results revealed that there are a range of demographic, social and psychological factors underpinning engagement with quarantine, school closures, and personal protective behaviours. Aside from the factors impacting on acceptance and compliance, there are several key community concerns about their use that need to be addressed including the potential for economic consequences. CONCLUSION: It is important that we acknowledge that these strategies will have an impact on an individual and the community. By understanding the barriers, we can identify what strategies need to be adopted to motivate individuals and improve community compliance. Using a behavioural framework to plan interventions based on these key barriers, will also ensure countries implement appropriate and targeted responses.","output":"Improving the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during COVID-19: examining the factors that influence engagement and the impact on individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We're delighted that this month Vet Record is publishing the full peer-reviewed Delphi research project on priority animal welfare issues in the UK.

Using T cell receptor (TCR)-specific aAPCs carrying co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptide-pentamer complexes, we expand virus-specific VIL derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of convalescent COVID-19 patients up to 1000-fold.

We also evaluate this approach for other viral pathogens using Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific VIL from donors as a control. Rapidly expanded VIL are enriched in virus antigen-specificity and show an activated, polyfunctional cytokine profile and T effector memory phenotype which may contribute to a robust immune response. Virus-specific T cells can also be delivered allogeneically via MHC-typing and patient human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matching to provide pragmatic treatment in a large-scale therapeutic setting.

In case of hospital admission, continuation of therapy in patients undergoing chronic NIV is necessary and several protective circuit configurations have been recommended to reduce the risk of aerosol dissemination. However, all these configurations increase instrumental dead space. We therefore designed this study to evaluate their effects on the tidal volume (VTE) required to preserve stable end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) with constant respiratory rate. METHODS A bench consisting of a test lung connected to an adult-sized mannequin head was set up. The model was ventilated through usual domiciliary configuration (single limb circuit with facial vented mask) which was used as reference. Then, five different circuit configurations including non-vented facial mask with viral/bacterial filter, modification of leak position, and change from single to double-limb circuit were evaluated. For each configuration, pressure support (PS) was gradually increased to reach reference PETCO2. Resulting VTE was recorded as primary outcome. RESULTS Reference PETCO2 was 38(0)mmHg, with a PS set at 10cmH2O, resulting in a VTE of 432(2)mL. Compared to reference, all the configurations evaluated required substantial increase in VTE to preserve alveolar ventilation, ranging from +79(2) to +216(1)mL. CONCLUSIONS Modifications of NIV configurations in the context of COVID-19 pandemic result in substantial increase of instrumental dead space.

Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on 20 March 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of standard of care (SOC) and early corticosteroid groups were evaluated, with a primary composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to intensive care unit (ICU), new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. RESULTS: We analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in SOC and early corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in the early corticosteroid group (34.9% vs 54.3%, P = .005).

Therefore, both an efficient control of the climatic parameters and a good air exchange are necessary to avoid transmission and spread of respiratory diseases. However, in such a dynamic system it is practically impossible to determine pathogenic substances with the necessary temporal and spatial resolution, but easy-to-measure parameters allow the air quality to be assessed in a passenger compartment. Carbon dioxide has already proven to be a useful indicator, especially in environments with a high occupancy of people. Airborne particulate matter can also be an important aspect for assessing the air quality in an indoor space. Consequently, the time courses of temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and particulate matter (PM(10)) were tracked and evaluated in local public transport buses, trams and trains in the Brunswick/Hanover region. In all measurements, the climatic conditions were comfortable for the passengers. Carbon dioxide was strongly correlated with occupancy and has proven to be the most informative parameter. The PM(10) concentration, however, often correlated with the dynamics of people when getting on and off, but not with the occupancy. Sensors, equipped with integrated GPS, were installed in the passenger cabins and were found to be useful for recording location-related effects such as stops. The results of this study show that the online recording of simple parameters is a valuable tool for assessing air quality as a function of time, location and number of people. When the occupancy is high, a low carbon dioxide level indicates good ventilation, which automatically reduces the risk of infection. It is therefore recommended to take more advantage of low-cost sensors as a control for air conditioning systems in passenger cabins and for evaluations of the dynamics in public transport.","output":"Time and spatially resolved tracking of the air quality in local public transport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Safety and efficiency of emergency care can be optimized with a triage system which uses urgency to prioritize care. The Dutch Obstetric Telephone Triage System (DOTTS) was developed to provide a basis for assessing urgency of unplanned obstetric care requests by telephone. Reliability and validity are important components in evaluating such (obstetric) triage systems. OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of Dutch Obstetric Telephone Triage, by calculating the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. METHODS: To evaluate the urgency levels of DOTTS by testing inter-rater and intra-rater reliability, 90 vignettes of possible requests were developed. Nineteen participants, from hospitals where DOTTS had been implemented, rated in two rounds a set of ten vignettes. The five urgency levels and five presenting symptoms had an equal spread and had to be entered in accordance with DOTTS per vignette. Urgency levels were dichotomized into high urgency and intermediate urgency. Inter-rater reliability was rated as degree of agreement between two different participants with the same vignette. Intra-rater reliability was rated as agreement by the same participants at different moments in time. The degree of inter-rater and intra-rater reliability was tested using weighted Cohens Kappa and ICC. RESULTS: The agreement of urgency level between participants in accordance with predefined urgency level per vignette was 90.5% (95% CI 87.5C93.6) [335 of 370]. Agreement of urgency level between participants was 88.5% (95% CI 84.9C93.0) [177 of 200] and 84.9% (95% CI 78.3C91.4) after re-rating [101 of 119].

The microbiome interacts with host immunity and can play important roles in the defenses against pathogens. In invertebrates, immune priming, that is, improved survival upon secondary exposure to a previously encountered pathogen, can be dependent upon the presence of the gut microbiome. However, it is currently unknown whether the microbiome changes upon priming treatment. We here addressed this question in a well-established model for immune priming, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum exposed to the entomopathogenic bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). After priming treatments, the microbiota composition of beetle larvae was assessed by deep sequencing of the V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We compared the effect of two established routes of priming treatments in this system: injection priming with heat-killed Bt and oral priming via ingestion of filtered sterilized bacterial spore culture supernatants. For oral priming, we used several strains of Bt known to vary in their ability to induce priming. Our study revealed changes in microbiome composition following the oral priming treatment with two different strains of Bt, only one of which (Bt tenebrionis, Btt) is known to lead to improved survival. In contrast, injection priming treatment with the same bacterial strain did not result in microbiome changes.

Ireland, which attracts many international medical graduates, implemented a doctor retention strategy from early 2015. This study measures junior doctors migration intentions, the reasons they leave and likelihood of them returning. The aim is to identify the characteristics and patterns of doctors who plan to emigrate to inform targeted measures to retain these doctors. Methods: A national sample of 1148 junior hospital doctors completed an online survey in early 2018, eliciting their experiences of training and working conditions. Respondents were asked to choose between the following career options: remain in Ireland, go and return, go and stay away, or quit medicine. Bivariate analyses and a two-stage multivariable analysis were used to model the factors associated with these outcomes. Results: 45% of respondents planned to remain in Ireland, 35% leave but return later, 17% leave and not return; and 3% to quit medicine. An intention to go abroad versus remain in Ireland was independently associated (P <.05) with the doctor being under 30 years (odds ratio [OR]=1.09 per year under 30), a non-European Union (EU) national (OR=1.54), a trainee (OR=1.50), and with hospital specialization, especially in Anesthesiology (OR=5.09). Respondents were more likely to remain if they had experienced improvements in supervision and training costs. Intention to go abroad and not return versus go and return was independently associated (P <.05) with: age over 30 years (OR=1.16 per year over 30); being a non-EU (OR=9.85) or non-Irish EU (OR=3.42) national; having trained through a graduate entry pathway (OR=2.17), specializing in Psychiatry (OR=4.76) and reporting that mentoring had become worse (OR=5.85). Conclusion: Irelands doctor retention strategy has not addressed the root causes of poor training and working experiences in Irish hospitals. It needs a more diversified retention strategy that addresses under-staffing, facilitates circular migration by younger trainees who choose to train abroad, identifies and addresses specialty-specific factors, and builds mentoring linkages between trainees and senior specialists.","output":"Doctor Retention: A Cross-sectional Study of How Ireland Has Been Losing the Battle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyzes the conflicting effects of investors' sentiment caused by public health emergencies and uses event analysis methods and linear regressions to examine the impact of such emergencies on the stock prices of insurance companies.

The altered input to spinal circuits below the lesion leads to maladaptive reorganisation which often leads to hyperreflexia in proprioceptive circuits. Neurotrophin 3 (NT3) is growth factor essential for the development of proprioceptive neurons. We have previously shown that following bilateral corticospinal tract axotomy, intramuscular delivery of an Adeno-Associated Viral vector encoding NT3 (AAV-NT3) induces proprioceptive circuit reorganisation linked to functional recovery. To assess its therapeutic effects following a clinically relevant bilateral C5-C6 contusion in rats, AAV-NT3 was injected intramuscularly into the dominant limb 24 hours after injury and forelimb function was assessed over 13 weeks. The injury generated hyperreflexia of a distal forelimb proprioceptive circuit. There was also loss of fine motor skills during reach-and-grasp and walking on a horizontal ladder. Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed atrophy of the spinal cord and white matter disruption throughout the lesion site together with extensive loss of grey matter. Unexpectedly, animals treated with AAV-NT3 had a slightly smaller lesion in the regions close to the epicentre compared to PBS treated animals. Rats treated with AAV-NT3 showed subtly better performance on the horizontal ladder and transient benefits on reach-and-grasp. AAV-NT3 did not normalise hyperreflexia in a treated muscle. The treatment increased the amount of NT3 in treated muscles but, unexpectedly, serum levels were only elevated in a small subset of animals. These results show that this dose and delivery of AAV-NT3 may generate subtle improvements in locomotion but additional treatments will be required to overcome the widespread sensorimotor deficits caused by contusion injury.","output":"An Adeno-Associated Viral vector encoding Neurotrophin 3 injected into affected forelimb muscles modestly improves sensorimotor function after contusive mid-cervical spinal cord injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest report of global hepatitis estimated 58 million people with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic disease and 1 [...].","output":"Special Issue Chronic HCV Infection: Clinical Advances and Eradication Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the 2nd week of July 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) infection spreading in the community. Now more than 15 lakhs peoples have been infected in India, out of the 26816 patients were deceased. COVID 19 outbreaks become an additional hazard to the health-care workers (HCWs), leading to fatigue, anxiety, depression and fear of death. The objective of this questionnaire-based study is to know about the knowledge of HCWs about COVID 19, their experiences while dealing with the disease, and the protective measures taken to prevent the infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted for 1 month starting from the 2nd week of June 2020 after getting institutional ethical clearance. This study included 240 HCWs posted in the medical and surgical Departments of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, Rajasthan. This questionnaire was prepared in online Google forms and required 2 min to complete. Mean, median, range, and standard deviation were used to describe the continuous variables, and percentages were used to describe the categorical data. RESULTS: Among 240 HCWs, 79.16% (n = 190) participants have good knowledge and adapted good precautions (score 15-23) for COVID 19 infection. Rest 20% (n = 48) and 0.8% (n = 2) participants has average (score 8-14) or poor knowledge (score &lt;8) with adaptation of average or poor precautionary measures against COVID 19, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that we have the requirement of more educational training programs for awareness of HCWs and precautionary measures against COVID 19.

There is an urgent need for robust antibody detection approaches to support diagnostics, vaccine development, safe individual release from quarantine and population lock-down exit strategies. The early promise of lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices has been questioned following concerns about sensitivity and specificity. Methods: We used a panel of plasma samples designated SARS-CoV-2 positive (from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals; n=40) and negative (samples banked in the UK prior to December-2019 (n=142)). We tested plasma for SARS-Cov-2 IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA and using nine different commercially available LFIA devices. Results: ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in 34/40 individuals with an RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (sensitivity 85%, 95%CI 70-94%), vs 0/50 pre-pandemic controls (specificity 100% [95%CI 93-100%]). IgG levels were detected in 31/31 RT-PCR-positive individuals tested 10 days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89-100%). IgG titres rose during the 3 weeks post symptom onset and began to fall by 8 weeks, but remained above the detection threshold. Point estimates for the sensitivity of LFIA devices ranged from 55-70% versus RT-PCR and 65-85% versus ELISA, with specificity 95-100% and 93-100% respectively. Within the limits of the study size, the performance of most LFIA devices was similar. Conclusions: The performance of current LFIA devices is inadequate for most individual patient applications. ELISA can be calibrated to be specific for detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG and is highly sensitive for IgG from 10 days following symptoms onset.","output":"Evaluation of antibody testing for SARS-Cov-2 using ELISA and lateral flow immunoassays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 has infected over 170,000 people worldwide and was associated with substantial mortality.

It is assumed that asynchronies worsen lung function and prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV). Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a novel approach to MV based on neural respiratory center output that is able to trigger, cycle, and regulate the ventilatory cycle. We hypothesized that the use of NAVA compared to conventional lung-protective MV will result in a reduction of the duration of MV. It is further hypothesized that NAVA compared to conventional lung-protective MV will result in a decrease in the length of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. METHODS/DESIGN This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 306 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure from several etiologies. Only patients ventilated for less than 5 days, and who are expected to require prolonged MV for an additional 72 h or more and are able to breathe spontaneously, will be considered for enrollment. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to two ventilatory arms: (1) conventional lung-protective MV (n = 153) and conventional lung-protective MV with NAVA (n = 153). Primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days, defined as days alive and free from MV at day 28 after endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes are total length of MV, and ICU and hospital mortality.

The availability of digitised clinical data can also turn organisations and their networks into learning healthcare systems (LHSs) if used across all levels of health and care. This review explores the impact of digital systems i.e. on patients with AKI care, to gauge progress towards establishing LHSs and to identify existing gaps in the research. METHODS: Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies of real-time or near real-time digital AKI management systems which reported process and outcome measures were included. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of 43 studies showed that most interventions used real-time serum creatinine levels to trigger responses to enable risk prediction, early recognition of AKI or harm prevention by individual clinicians (micro level) or specialist teams (meso level). Interventions at system (macro level) were rare. There was limited evidence of change in outcomes. DISCUSSION: While the benefits of real-time digital clinical data at micro level for AKI management have been evident for some time, their application at meso and macro levels is emergent therefore limiting progress towards establishing LHSs. Lack of progress is due to digital maturity, system design, human factors and policy levers.

It has not been widely investigated in mainland China as appropriate measures are lacking. The current study aimed to validate a Chinese (Mandarin) version of the Committed Action Questionnaire (CAQ-8) in a non-clinical college sample and to explore whether committed action would have a mediating effect in the association between experiential avoidance (EA) and life satisfaction. Methods: We translated the CAQ-8 into Chinese (Mandarin). A total of 913 Chinese undergraduates completed a set of questionnaires measuring committed action, EA, mindful awareness, anxiety, depression, stress, and life satisfaction. For testCretest reliability, 167 respondents completed the CAQ-8 again 4 weeks later. Results: The entire scale of CAQ-8 (Mandarin) and two subscales showed adequate internal consistency and acceptable testCretest reliability. Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the two-factor structure and the convergent and criterion validity were acceptable. Committed action was correlated with less EA, more mindful awareness, less depressive symptoms, less anxiety, less stress, and more life satisfaction. In bootstrap mediation analyses, committed action partially mediated the association between EA and life satisfaction. Conclusion: The results suggest that the CAQ-8 (Mandarin) is a brief, psychometrically sound instrument to investigate committed action in Chinese populations, and the relationship between EA and life satisfaction was partially explained by committed action.

Penicillium italicum is the causal pathogen of blue mold in harvested citrus fruits, not only causing huge fungal decay but also leading to quality deterioration. In our preliminary study, antofine (ATF) was found to have a great potential for significant in vitro suppression of P. italicum growth. However, the regulatory mechanism underpinning ATF-triggered resistance against P. italicum in citrus fruit remains unclear. Here, the protective effects of ATF treatment on blue mold development in harvested Ponkan fruit involving the enhancement of ROS-scavenging system were investigated. Results showed that ATF treatment delayed blue mold development and peel firmness loss. Moreover, the increase of electrolyte leakage, O2 a?- production, and malonyldialdehyde accumulation was significantly inhibited by ATF treatment. The ATF-treated Ponkan fruit maintained an elevated antioxidant capacity, as evidenced by inducted the increase in glutathione (GSH) content, delayed the declines of ascorbic acid (AsA) content and GSH/oxidized GSH ratio, and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and six key AsA-GSH cycle-related enzymes, along with their encoding gene expressions, thereby maintaining ROS homeostasis and reducing postharvest blue mold in harvested Ponkan fruit.

We hypothesized that cPLA2 and myelin debris are key mediators of persistent pro-inflammatory macrophage responses after SCI. To test this, we examined spinal cord tissue 28-days after thoracic contusion SCI in 3-month-old female mice and observed both cPLA2 activation and intracellular accumulation of lipid-rich myelin debris in macrophages. In vitro, we utilized bone marrow-derived macrophages to determine myelin's effects across a spectrum of activation states. We observed phenotype-specific responses with myelin potentiating only pro-inflammatory (LPS + INF-?3; M1) macrophage activation, whereas myelin did not induce pro-inflammatory responses in unstimulated or anti-inflammatory (IL-4; M2) macrophages. Specifically, myelin increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide production in M1 macrophages as well as M1-mediated neurotoxicity.

This study aims to clarify whether multimodality imaging guided LV lead placement improves clinical outcome after CRT. METHODS/DESIGN The ImagingCRT study is a prospective, randomized, patient- and assessor-blinded, two-armed trial. The study is designed to investigate the effect of imaging guided left ventricular lead positioning on a clinical composite primary endpoint comprising all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, or unchanged or worsened functional capacity (no improvement in New York Heart Association class and <10% improvement in six-minute-walk test). Imaging guided LV lead positioning is targeted to the latest activated non-scarred myocardial region by speckle tracking echocardiography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and cardiac computed tomography. Secondary endpoints include changes in LV dimensions, ejection fraction and dyssynchrony. A total of 192 patients are included in the study. DISCUSSION Despite tremendous advances in knowledge with CRT, the proportion of patients not responding to this treatment has remained stable since the introduction of CRT.

In these studies, cells or animals were challenged with hyperoxia or other injury-inducing agents. However, little is known about the effect of MSCs on immature fetal lungs and whether MSCs are able to improve lung maturity, which may alleviate lung developmental arrest in BPD. METHODS: We aimed to determine if the conditioned medium (CM) of MSCs stimulates functional and structural lung maturation. As a measure of functional maturation, Na(+) transport in primary fetal distal lung epithelial cells (FDLE) was studied in Ussing chambers. Na(+) transporter and surfactant protein mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Structural maturation was assessed by microscopy in fetal rat lung explants. RESULTS: MSC-CM strongly increased the activity of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) and the Na,K-ATPase as well as their mRNA expression. Branching and growth of fetal lung explants and surfactant protein mRNA expression were enhanced by MSC-CM. Epithelial integrity and metabolic activity of FDLE cells were not influenced by MSC-CM. Since MSCs actions are mainly attributed to paracrine signaling, prominent lung growth factors were blocked. None of the tested growth factors (VEGF, BMP, PDGF, EGF, TGF-, FGF, HGF) contributed to the MSC-induced increase of Na(+) transport. In contrast, inhibition of PI3-K/AKT and Rac1 signaling reduced MSC-CM efficacy, suggesting an involvement of these pathways in the MSC-CM-induced Na(+) transport. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that MSC-CM strongly stimulated functional and structural maturation of the fetal lungs. These effects were at least partially mediated by the PI3-K/AKT and Rac1 signaling pathway. Thus, MSCs not only repair a deleterious tissue environment, but also target lung cellular immaturity itself.","output":"Paracrine stimulation of perinatal lung functional and structural maturation by mesenchymal stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 have impacted retailers greatly.

A narrative literature review was performed through a systematic search on PubMed(?), Scopus(?), and Web of Science(?). The review focused on 50 relevant contributions. Organizational health literacy triggers the transition towards a patient-centered approach to care. It complements individual health literacy, enabling patients to actively participate in health promotion and risk prevention as co-producers of health services and co-creators of value. However, many obstacles C including lack of time and limited resources available C prevent the transition towards health literate health care organizations. Two initiatives are required to overcome extant barriers. On the one hand, a health literate workforce should be prepared to increase the institutional ability of health care organizations to empower and engage patients in health co-creation. On the other hand, increased efforts should be made to assess organizational health literacy and to make its contribution to preventive medicine explicit.","output":"Leveraging Organizational Health Literacy to Enhance Health Promotion and Risk Prevention: A Narrative and Interpretive Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Se examina la gestin de Donald Trump, presidente de los EEUU, en la pandemia de covid-19.","output":"The pandemic: Donald Trump's last act?/ La pandemia: ?el acto final de Donald Trump?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with severe COVID-19 infection exhibit a low level of oxygen in affected tissue and blood. To understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection, it is therefore necessary to understand cell function during hypoxia. We investigated aspects of human monocyte activation under hypoxic conditions. HMGB1 is an alarmin released by stressed cells. Under normoxic conditions, HMGB1 activates interferon regulatory factor (IRF)5 and nuclear factor-&#954;B in monocytes, leading to expression of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor &#945;, and interleukin 1?, respectively. When hypoxic monocytes are activated by HMGB1, they produce proinflammatory cytokines but fail to produce type I IFN. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945;, induced by hypoxia, functions as a direct transcriptional repressor of IRF5 and IRF3. As hypoxia is a stressor that induces secretion of HMGB1 by epithelial cells, hypoxia establishes a microenvironment that favors monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines but not IFN.

Molecular mimicry between proteins from two viruses can lead to beneficial cross-protection when the antibodies produced by exposure to one also react with the other. On the other hand, mimicry between a protein from a pathogen and a human protein can lead to auto-immune disorders if the antibodies resulting from exposure to the virus end up interacting with host proteins. While cross-protection can suggest the possible reuse of vaccines developed for other pathogens, cross-reaction with host proteins may explain side effects. There are no computational tools available to date for a large-scale search of antibody cross-reactivity. Results We present a comprehensive Epitope-based Molecular Mimicry Search (EMoMiS) pipeline for computational molecular mimicry searches. EMoMiS, when applied to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, identified eight examples of molecular mimicry with viral and human proteins. These findings provide possible explanations for (a) differential severity of COVID-19 caused by cross-protection due to prior vaccinations and/or exposure to other viruses, and (b) commonly seen COVID-19 side effects such as thrombocytopenia and thrombophilia. Our findings are supported by previously reported research but need validation with laboratory experiments. The developed pipeline is generic and can be applied to find mimicry for novel pathogens.

Here, we offer a totally laparoscopic simple RY using linear staplers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Each 50 consecutive patients with totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with RY and BI were enrolled in this study. Technical safety and surgical outcomes of RY were evaluated in comparison with BI. RESULTS In all patients, RY gastrectomy using linear staplers was safely performed without any events during surgery. The mean operation time and anastomosis time were 177.037.6 min and 14.45.6 min for RY, respectively, which were significantly longer than those for BI (150.434.0 min and 5.92.2 min, respectively). There were no differences in amount of blood loss, time to flatus passage, diet start, length of hospital stay, and postoperative inflammatory response between the two groups. Although there was no significant difference in surgical complications between RY and BI (6.0% and 14.0%), the RY group showed no anastomosis site-related complications. CONCLUSION The double stapling method using linear staplers in totally laparoscopic RY reconstruction is a simple and safe procedure.","output":"Totally laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy: analysis of initial 50 consecutive cases of single surgeon in comparison with totally laparoscopic Billroth I reconstruction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and kills over 17 million people per year.

The purpose of this work is to provide recent advances in air pollution-induced arrhythmias with a comprehensive review of the literature on the common air pollutants and arrhythmias. Six common air pollutants of widespread concern are discussed, namely particulate matter, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The epidemiological and clinical reports in recent years are reviewed by pollutant type, and the recently identified mechanisms including both the general pathways and the direct influences of air pollutants on the cellular electrophysiology are summarized. Particularly, this review focuses on the impaired ion channel functionality underlying the air pollution-induced arrhythmias. Alterations of ionic currents directly by the air pollutants, as well as the alterations mediated by intracellular signaling or other more general pathways are reviewed in this work.

Increased hospital visits to receive treatment as well as interaction with healthcare personnel (HCP), represent a potential risk factor for acquiring COVID-19. Our objective was to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in patients (pts) with cancer and HCP of a chemoradiotherapy unit localized in a center designated as a COVID-19 priority facility in Mexico City. Methods: We invited HCP and pts with solid tumors attending the chemoradiotherapy unit to participate in a prospective follow-up cohort to early detect asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. Only participants who gave informed consent were included. A RT-PCR test for SARS-COV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab samples was performed every 2 weeks, and daily electronic clinical questionnaires were sent. Recruitment started on June 12, 2020. Participants entered the study in different moments and they were followed until a positive test for COVID-19 was found, or pts finished treatment or, HCP changed work area or, withdrawal of inform consent, or follow up completion, which ever occurred first. The last day of follow up was September 30, 2020. The general infection rate during all the period of follow-up was calculated, as well as the infection rate per month. Results: We included 130 asymptomatic participants, 44.6% (n = 58) were HCP and 55.4% (n = 72) were cancer pts, 45.9% (n = 61) were men, and 54.1% (n = 72) were women. During a median follow-up of 85 days (IQR 48-103) we performed 634 nasopharyngeal swabs for SARSCoV- 2 RT-PCR, with a median number per participant of 5 (IQR 3-7). Within this period, 18 (13.5%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV- 2 infection. 12 were asymptomatic and 6 developed symptoms. None of them had a severe form of COVID-19 and we did not register any death associated to COVID-19. Table shows the infection rate per month. Conclusions: In our center, during the time period of follow up, the overall rate of COVID-19 infection was higher than that reported in a study from asymptomatic HCP and office workers in Mexico City (13.5 vs 8.4%). We also observed a monthly variation that was consistent with the months with the highest number of cases detected in Mexico City during the first wave.

This reflected our experience at University of Maryland School of Medicine despite our diverse community where over 60% of the population identify as Black or African American. We share our strategies to mitigate bias in the admissions process and our resulting outcomes. METHODS We implemented multiple interventions including interviewer training, recruitment strategies, holistic screening, changes in the interview process, and increased racial, ethnic, and gender diversity on our admissions committee. These changes were made over a two-year period initially focusing on the committee, followed by focused interventions for interviewers. RESULTS With these interventions we demonstrated an improvement in the number of URM applicants that matriculated. In 2019 we had the first class that was in which no one ethnicity or race comprised the majority of the class, with 54% of matriculants identifying as students of color. In 2020, in addition to sustaining a majority of the class identifying as students of color, the proportion of URM students increased from 10-13% for the preceding 3 years, to 24% of the entering class. CONCLUSION The number of physicians who identify as URM must be increased for the benefit of our patients and health care system.

Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were interrogated for studies (2000-2021) reporting venovenous ECCO2R use in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. Studies reporting []10 adult patients in English language journals were included. Ventilatory parameters after 24 hours of initiating ECCO2R, device characteristics, and safety outcomes were collected. The primary outcome measure was the change in driving pressure at 24 hours of ECCO2R therapy in relation to baseline. Secondary outcomes included change in tidal volume, gas exchange, and safety data. Results: Ten studies reporting 421 patients (PaO2:FiO2 141.03mmHg) were included. Extracorporeal blood flow rates ranged from 0.35-1.5 L/min. Random effects modelling indicated a 3.56 cmH2O reduction (95%-CI: 3.22-3.91) in driving pressure from baseline (p<0.001) and a 1.89 ml/kg (95%-CI: 1.75-2.02, p<0.001) reduction in tidal volume. Oxygenation, respiratory rate and PEEP remained unchanged.

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out online and using a structured questionnaire during April 2020. In total, 4788 men and women with the age range of 11-98 years from eight provinces in eastern, central and western China were included in the analysis. We adopted a tactical approach to capture three key domains of perceived psychosocial health that are more likely to occur during a pandemic including hopelessness, loneliness, and depression. Multiple regression method, binary logistic regression model and variance inflation factor (VIF) were used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS: Respectively 34.8%, 32.5% and 44.8% of the participants expressed feeling more hopeless, lonely, and depressed during the pandemic. The percentage of all three indicators was comparatively higher among women than among men: hopelessness (50.7% vs 49.3%), loneliness (52.4% vs 47.6%), and depression (56.2% vs 43.8%). Being married was associated with lower odds of loneliness among men (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45-0.90). Loneliness was negatively associated with smoking (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.45-0.99) and positively associated with drinking (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.04-2.02). Compared with those in the lowest income bracket (< CNY 10 000), men (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.21-0.55) and women (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.23-0.56) in the highest level of annually housed income (> CNY 40 000) had the lowest odds of reporting perceived hopelessness (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.48). Smoking also showed negative association with depression only among men (OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.43-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of the participants reported worsening in the experience of hopelessness and loneliness, with more than two-fifth of worsening depression during the pandemic compared with before the outbreak.

We examined the mean number of outpatient visits for UI and the type of provider seen, using t tests and 2 tests. Providers were categorized as specialist and nonspecialist providers using taxonomy codes. RESULTS The percentage of women 65 years or older who had an outpatient visits for UI over 12 months was 6.4% in the Nurses' Health Study cohort and 5.4% in the general population. The mean number of office visits for UI in 2012 was similar between nurses and the matched general population (mean = 1.8 vs 1.8; P = 0.3).

Women seeking screening or treatment services experience delays in receiving screening results provided at community clinics or district hospitals, and lack sufficient resources to pay out-of-pocket to travel to the capital city of Lima for specialized treatment. Continued disparities in health outcomes and systemic barriers to accessing services suggest there are gaps between policy measures and implementation. OBJECTIVES: We aim to understand why national policies and clinical pathways that are aligned to global standards have been insufficient in improving cervical cancer screening and treatment in Peru, particularly among women who experience systemic exclusion from health services. METHODS: We conducted a policy analysis based on a literature review (2005C2020), in Spanish and English, on PubMed, Global Health, Scopus, EconLit, Lilacs, and Scielo using a value-based care framework. FINDINGS: The main barriers included unequal distribution of health infrastructure and health care workforce, and differences in access to health insurance. Additional barriers, including limited political will and support, limit efforts to prioritize the implementation of cervical cancer policies. We propose policy considersations in redesigning payment models, expanding healthcare workforce, generating costing and policy evidence, and reviewing policies for point-of-care technologies. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The barriers identified in this literature review are applicable not only to cervical cancer care, but to primary health care in Peru. Systematic policy changes that address root causes of health inequities and are implemented at scale are needed to advance health reform efforts.","output":"Policy Considerations to Promote Equitable Cervical Cancer Screening and Treatment in Peru"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vasovagal reaction (VVR) compromises donor safety and reduces the subsequent return rates. Performing applied muscle tension (AMT) during phlebotomy may reduce the incidence of VVR. However, the effectiveness of performing AMT after phlebotomy to reduce delayed VVR remains unclear. With ethics approval, 12 young, first-time donors (YFTD) were recruited to study the effects on stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) while performing AMT from needle insertion to end of recovery. Measurements from 12 matched control YFTD were used for comparison. Pre-donation anxiety and VVR severity were assessed. Compared to controls, donors who performed AMT had higher SV (Control: 57 mL vs. AMT: 69 mL, p = 0.045), higher CO (Control: 3.7 Lmin(?1) vs. AMT: 5.2 Lmin(?1), p = 0.006) and lower SVR (Control: 1962 dynscm(?5) vs. AMT: 1569 dynscm(?5), p = 0.032) during mid-phlebotomy. During recovery, the AMT group retained higher SV, higher CO and lower SVR than the control, but not reaching statistical significance. Practicing AMT during recovery resulted in sustained haemodynamic improvements beyond the donation period, despite the reduction in delayed VVR was insignificant compared to the control group.

Authorities have deployed several surveillance tools to detect and slow down the rapid misinformation spread online. Large quantities of unverified information are available online and at present there is no real-time tool available to alert a user about false information during online health inquiries over a web search engine. To bridge this gap, we propose a web search engine misinformation notifier extension (SEMiNExt). Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithm have been successfully integrated into the extension. This enables SEMiNExt to read the user query from the search bar, classify the veracity of the query and notify the authenticity of the query to the user, all in real-time to prevent the spread of misinformation. Our results show that SEMiNExt under artificial neural network (ANN) works best with an accuracy of 93%, F1-score of 92%, precision of 92% and a recall of 93% when 80% of the data is trained. Moreover, ANN is able to predict with a very high accuracy even for a small training data size. This is very important for an early detection of new misinformation from a small data sample available online that can significantly reduce the spread of misinformation and maximize public health safety. The SEMiNExt approach has introduced the possibility to improve online health management system by showing misinformation notifications in real-time, enabling safer web-based searching on health-related issues.","output":"Web Search Engine Misinformation Notifier Extension (SEMiNExt): A Machine Learning Based Approach during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although prisoners are considered a vulnerable population, no data repository currently exists to monitor the COVID-19 incidence in Nigerian prisons.

Adaptive functions are required for age-appropriate interactions and day to day functioning, but are reduced in AYA survivors. Work in other pediatric populations suggests that additional neurocognitive skills may influence adaptive function and, thus, quality of life and personal attainment of AYA cancer survivors. Methods: Retrospective medical records review examined neurocognitive data from 139 AYA survivors. Hierarchical linear regression examined age at diagnosis, use of central nervous system (CNS) radiation, verbal intelligence, processing speed, and executive function as predictors of adaptive functioning domains. Results: AYA survivors exhibited weaknesses in all domains of adaptive functioning compared to normative reference values (Cohen's d = 0.660-0.864), as well as in processing speed (Cohen's d = 0.791) and metacognitive executive functioning (Cohen's d = 0.817). Processing speed and executive function provided substantial improvements in prediction of adaptive functioning beyond that of age at diagnosis and use of CNS-directed radiation therapy. Taken together these variables explained 37.1% of variability in adaptive conceptual skills, 26.1% in adaptive social skills, and 27.1% of adaptive practical skills. Conclusions: Intelligence, processing speed, and executive function significantly contribute to adaptive function scores in AYA cancer survivors and impact domains that are important to self-sufficiency and quality of life.

The dynamic and unpredictable nature of many clinical situations has placed emergency service personnel in direct danger of contracting the disease. This work uses a validated survey developed for the study to assess the predictors of stress that paramedics, nurses and doctors experience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group included 955 medical staff, and the level of significance adopted for statistical analysis was p = 0.05. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze the qualitative variables divided into groups. The selection of tests was carried out based on the distribution of variables, verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In order to determine the predictors that caused the feelings of stress, it was necessary to use the linear regression model. RESULTS During the COVID-19 pandemic, stress among emergency medical personnel has increased considerably due to new factors that did not previously exist. The predictors of stress in the professional environment include the fear of contracting COVID-19, a decrease in the level of safety while conducting emergency medical procedures, and the marginalization of treatment for patients not suffering from COVID-19. Additional socio-demographic factors that increase stress among emergency medical personnel are being female and working in the nursing profession. Appropriate training, the supply of personal protective equipment and opinions on the preparedness of the system to deal with the outbreak of the pandemic did not affect the level of stress among health service personnel.

METHODS: Healthy subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis (examined out of season) were subjected to nasal challenge with TNF (10 g) in a sham-controlled and crossover design. Nasal lavages were carried out prior to and 24 hours post challenge. Nasal biopsies were obtained post challenge. Nasal lavage fluid levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were analyzed as indices of neutrophil and eosinophil activity. Moreover, IL-8 and (2)-macroglobulin were analyzed as markers of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and plasma exudation. Nasal biopsy numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils were monitored. RESULTS: Nasal lavage fluid levels of MPO recorded 24 hours post TNF challenge were increased in healthy subjects (p = 0.0081) and in patients with allergic rhinitis (p = 0.0081) (c.f. sham challenge).

For example, an individual may contribute disproportionately to transmission by way of an extremely high contact rate or by way of low recovery, but how these two super-spreaders differ in their effect on epidemiological dynamics is unclear. Furthermore, epidemiological traits may often covary with one another in ways that promote or inhibit super-spreading. What patterns of covariation, and between what traits, are most likely to lead to large epidemics driven by super-spreading? Using stochastic individual-based simulations of an SIR epidemiological model, we explore how variation and covariation between transmission-related traits (contact rate and infectiousness) and duration-related traits (virulence and recovery) of infected individuals affects super-spreading and peak epidemic size. We show that covariation matters when contact rate and infectiousness covary: peak epidemic size is largest when they covary positively and smallest when they covary negatively. We did not see that more super-spreading always leads to larger epidemics, rather, we show that the relationship between super-spreading and peak epidemic size is dependent on which traits are covarying.

To study associations of severity of COVID-19 disease with clinical features and laboratory markers. 2. To develop a model to predict the need for ICU treatment. Methods: This is an analysis of clinical course in 800 consecutive patients from a dedicated COVID-19 tertiary care hospital in Pune, India (8th April to 15th June 2020). We obtained clinical and laboratory information, severity grading and progress from hospital records. We studied associations of these characteristics with need for ICU management. We developed a predictive model of need for ICU treatment among first 500 patients and tested its sensitivity and specificity in the following 300 patients. Results: Average age was 41 years, 16% were <20 years of age, 55% were male, 50% were asymptomatic and 16% had at least one comorbidity. Using MoHFW India severity guidelines, 73% patients had mild, 6% moderate and 20% severe disease. Severity was associated with higher age, symptomatic presentation, elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts and elevated inflammatory markers. Seventy-seven patients needed ICU treatment: they were older (56 years), more symptomatic and had lower SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray and deranged hematology and biochemistry at admission. A model trained on the first 500 patients, using above variables predicted need for ICU treatment with sensitivity 80%, specificity 88% in subsequent 300 patients;exclusion of expensive laboratory tests (Ferritin, C- Reactive Protein) did not affect accuracy. Conclusion: In the early phase of COVID- 19 pendemic, a significant proportion of hospitalized patients were young and asymptomatic.

RESULTS Six key gendered dimensions of vulnerability and resilience emerged from our analysis: (1) restricted maternal access to financial and economic resources; (2) limited economic contribution of women as a result of motherhood; (3) social norms, ideologies, beliefs and perceptions inhibiting women's access to maternal healthcare services; (4) restricted maternal agency and contribution to reproductive decisions; (5) power dynamics and experience of intimate partner violence contributing to adverse health for women, children and their families; (6) partner emotional or affective support being crucial for maternal health and well-being prenatal and postnatal. CONCLUSION This review highlights six domains that merit attention in addressing maternal and child health vulnerabilities. Recognising and understanding the gendered dynamics of vulnerability and resilience can help develop meaningful strategies that will guide the design and implementation of MNCH programmes in low-income and middle-income countries.","output":"Examining vulnerability and resilience in maternal, newborn and child health through a gender lens in low-income and middle-income countries: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is considered desirable treatment for patients at high risk for carotid endarterectomy. Despite a growing elderly population, scant data exist on CAS in nonagenarians. Nonagenarians represent a high risk population for open and endovascular interventions due to unique anatomic and physiologic characteristics presenting significant challenges to anesthesiologists and surgeons. Studies have quantified that symptomatic and asymptomatic patients should survive 2 and 5 years, respectively, to gain benefit from revascularization; thus doubt exists on the value of CAS in nonagenarian patients because of their extreme age and unique risk factors. We therefore evaluated CAS safety and efficacy in our hospital's nonagenarian population. METHODS CAS cases performed in patients aged  90 years between April 2005 and January 2013 were retrospectively examined. Relevant demographic and medical data were reviewed. Rates of perioperative complications and complications until end of follow-up (including stroke, myocardial infarction, death) were compiled. RESULTS Among 21 nonagenarian cases of stent placement performed in 20 patients (11 symptomatic, nine asymptomatic), two patients suffered perioperative stroke after undergoing CAS and one died during the perioperative period. 50% of symptomatic patients were alive at 19 months; 50% of asymptomatic patients were alive at 47 months. CONCLUSIONS CAS in nonagenarian patients carried increased risk of perioperative ischemic events, compared with contemporary trial results in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Further, mean survival time postprocedure fell short of guidelines for receiving procedural benefit. Although larger scale multicenter research is needed, we recommend careful consideration of overall health status when contemplating stenting in nonagenarians.","output":"Carotid artery stenting in nonagenarians: are there benefits in surgically treating this high risk population?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Protection of Intellectual Property Rights under International Investment Law by Simon Klopschinski, Christopher Gibson and Henning Grosse Ruse-Khan [ Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2021, 592pp, ISBN: 9780198712268, 125.00 (h/bk)] This is the first book-length treatment (based on the first author's doctoral thesis, published in 2011) of the issues raised by recent cases in international investment arbitration dealing with intellectual property rights (IPRs).

These proteins are involved in the folding of newly synthesized proteins and refolding of damaged or misfolded proteins. Recent studies have been focused on the regulatory role of HSPs in OS and ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) where reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role. ROS perform many functions, including cell signaling. Unfortunately, they are also the cause of pathological processes leading to various diseases. Biological pathways such as p38 MAPK, HSP70 and Akt/GSK-3/eNOS, HSP70, JAK2/STAT3 or PI3K/Akt/HSP70, and HSF1/Nrf2-Keap1 are considered in the relationship between HSP and OS. New pathophysiological mechanisms involving ROS are being discovered and described the protein network of HSP interactions. Understanding of the mechanisms involved, e.g., in I/R, is important to the development of treatment methods. HSPs are multifunctional proteins because they closely interact with the antioxidant and the nitric oxide generation systems, such as HSP70/HSP90/NOS. A deficiency or excess of antioxidants modulates the activation of HSF and subsequent HSP biosynthesis. It is well known that HSPs are involved in the regulation of several redox processes and play an important role in protein-protein interactions. The latest research focuses on determining the role of HSPs in OS, their antioxidant activity, and the possibility of using HSPs in the treatment of I/R consequences. Physical exercises are important in patients with cardiovascular diseases, as they affect the expression of HSPs and the development of OS.","output":"Heat Shock Proteins in Oxidative Stress and Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury and Benefits from Physical Exercises: A Review to the Current Knowledge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The data contribute to a better understanding of the circulation of influenza viruses especially in North-Africa. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this surveillance was to detect severe influenza cases, identify their epidemiological and virological characteristics and assess their impact on the healthcare system. METHOD: We describe in this report the findings of laboratory-based surveillance of human cases of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses' infection during three seasons in Tunisia. RESULTS: The 2008C09 winter influenza season is underway in Tunisia, with co-circulation of influenza A/H3N2 (56.25%), influenza A(H1N1) (32.5%), and a few sporadic influenza B viruses (11.25%). In 2010C11 season the circulating strains are predominantly the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (70%) and influenza B viruses (22%). And sporadic viruses were sub-typed as A/H3N2 and unsubtyped influenza A, 5% and 3%, respectively. Unlike other countries, highest prevalence of influenza B virus Yamagata-like lineage has been reported in Tunisia (76%) localised into the clade B/Bangladesh/3333/2007. In the pandemic year, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated over other influenza viruses (95%). Amino acid changes D222G and D222E were detected in the HA gene of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in two severe cases, one fatal case and one mild case out of 50 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses studied. The most frequently reported respiratory virus other than influenza in three seasons was RSV (45.29%). CONCLUSION: This article summarises the surveillance and epidemiology of influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses, showing how rapid improvements in influenza surveillance were feasible by connecting the existing structure in the health care system for patient records to electronic surveillance system for reporting ILI cases.","output":"Virological Surveillance of Influenza Viruses during the 2008C09, 2009C10 and 2010C11 Seasons in Tunisia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several pandemics have been reported throughout history The Black Death, Spanish flu, SARs and MERs among many others have received attentions by both earlier and recent scholarships due to their impact on humanity Before the outbreak of COVID-19, scholars had anticipated future outbreaks with the same, if not greater, impact The coronavirus which spread from Wuhan from December 2019, across nations has already decimated over 515,974 lives with the Americans and Europeans scoring higher in mortality rates Since its outbreak, scholars have reported cases and measured its impact concerning nations and the international economy However, data on Africa and Ghana in particular concerning COVID-19 seems inadequate From a historical political economy approach, we add to the corpus of information on pandemics by using the theories of political economy and globalizations to discuss pandemics and COVID-19 in particular We have traced the economic history of earlier pandemics and relate same to the current burden We discuss how resources have been distributed to address health systems of Africa and Ghana in particular Also, the current contribution pays attention to critical questions on COVID-19 in Africa Evidence from the study suggests that African nations shall do better when they collaborate their efforts and resources to fight the pandemic and others that might erupt in the near future From the discussions, we draw lessons for stakeholders and policy makers","output":"A COVID in the wheels of the world: A contemporary history of a pandemic in africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a target sign on chest CT characterized by a combination of peripheral ring-like opacity and a central nodular ground-glass opacity surrounding a vessel in a couple with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase fluorescence polymerase chain reaction sputum analysis.","output":"Chest CT target sign in a couple with COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Some patients may need mechanical ventilation support during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (coronavirus disease-2019, COVID-19) infection and may eventually require tracheostomy in the following days.

Though primarily a respiratory illness, cardiovascular risk factors predict adverse outcomes. We aimed to investigate the role of baseline echocardiographic abnormalities in further refining risk in addition to clinical risk factors. Methods Adults with COVID-19 positive RT-PCR test across St Lukes University Health Network between March 1st 2020-October 31st 2020 were identified. Those with trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) within 15C180 days preceding COVID-19 positivity were selected, excluding severe valvular disease, acute cardiac event between TTE and COVID-19, or asymptomatic patients positive on screening. Demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic variables were manually extracted from patients EHR and compared between groups stratified by disease severity. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of hospitalization. Results 192 patients met inclusion criteria. 87 (45.3%) required hospitalization, 34 (17.7%) suffered severe disease (need for ICU care/mechanical ventilation/in-hospital death). Age, co-morbidities, and several echocardiographic abnormalities were more prevalent in those with moderate-severe disease than in mild disease, with notable exceptions of systolic/diastolic dysfunction. On multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.039, 95% CI 1.011C1.067), coronary artery disease (OR 4.184, 95% CI 1.451C12.063), COPD (OR 6.886, 95% CI 1.396C33.959) and left atrial diameter  4.0 cm (OR 2.379, 95% CI 1.031C5.493) predicted need for hospitalization.

In Saudi Arabia, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in March 2, 2020. In March 8, 2020, the Saudi authorities adopted the lockdown strategy to contain the disease. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the various phases of the lockdown strategy in Saudi Arabia and its impact on the basic reproductive number (R0) of the COVID-19 outbreak. Material and Methods: The timeline of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia was divided into three-time intervals. Google Mobility Community Reports (2020) was used to estimate the changes in community mobility during the various phases of the lockdown. The basic reproductive number (R0) of the COVID-19 outbreak was calculated daily using the Susceptible, Infected and Recovered (SIR) model based on the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) daily reports. This is a standard system to determine the spread of the virus on the basis of infection rate, quarantine rate as well as confirmation rate. The mean values of the calculated R0 during each interval were compared using one-way ANOVA test. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the mean values of the different phases of the lockdown (P < 0.05). Moreover, mean R0 value of the second interval was 0.09 higher than the initial interval with free community mobility. Furthermore, the mean R0 values of the third interval with the full lockdown was 0.28 higher than the initial interval. Conclusion: Early implementation of lockdown strategy combined with other social distancing strategies help in containing infectious outbreaks in their early phases.

A prospective pilot study addressed the question if addition of FRWBH to re-irradiation is feasible in recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with unfavorable prognostic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study completed accrual with the recruitment of ten patients between April 2018 and March 2020. Re-irradiation was administered using volumetric arc hyperfractionated radiotherapy with bi-daily 1.2 Gray (Gy) single fractions and a total dose of 66 Gy to all macroscopic tumor lesions. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted mostly of cisplatin (7 patients). FRWBH was scheduled weekly during re-irradiation. The study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (NCT03547388). RESULTS: Only five patients received all cycles of FRWBH. Poor patient compliance, active infections during treatment and study restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic were the main reasons for omitting FRWBH. No increase of acute toxicity was observed by FRWBH. Exploratory evaluation of outcome data suggests that FRWBH treatment according to protocol does not seem to have a detrimental effect on tumor control or survival and might even increase treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: FRWBH is difficult to apply concomitant to re-irradiation in HNSCC. No excess toxicity was observed in patients receiving FRWBH and exploratory analyses suggest potential anti-tumor activity and decreased patient-reported depression scores after FRWBH.","output":"Fever range whole body hyperthermia for re-irradiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas: Final results of a prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The differences and relationship between joint stiffness and leg stiffness can be used to characterize the lower limb behavior during different walking speeds. RESEARCH QUESTION: This study aimed to investigate the differences in whole leg and lower limb joint stiffness at different walking speeds and the interactions between leg and lower limb joint stiffness. METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy adults, seventeen males (age: 19.6a?a?2.2 years, height: 176.0a?a?6.0a?cm, mass: 69.7a?a?8.9a?kg), and ten females (age: 19.1a?a?1.9 years, height: 164.0a?a?3.0a?cm, mass: 59.6a?a?3.8a?kg), were recruited. Dynamic leg and joint stiffness were calculated during eccentric loading from data recorded using 3D infrared motion analysis and force plates at slow, normal, and fast walking speeds. Differences in dynamic stiffness, joint angles and moments were explored between the walking speeds using Repeated Measures ANOVA with Sidak post-hoc tests. Correlations between leg, joint stiffness, and walking speed were also explored. RESULTS: The results indicated that the leg dynamic stiffness is decreased by walking speed, however, hip and ankle joint stiffness were increased (pa?<a?0.001) and knee stiffness was unaffected. Leg stiffness showed no correlation with hip, knee, or ankle stiffness. A positive significant correlation was seen between hip and ankle stiffness (pa?<a?0.01) and between knee and ankle stiffness (pa?<a?0.001), however, no correlation was seen between hip and knee stiffness.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented health and economic crisis worldwide. Little is known about the specifics of its influence on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA). In this study, we aim to investigate the prevalence and mortality in PLWHA co-infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The databases PUBMED, EMBASE, BioRxiv, and medRxiv were searched up to 9 March 2021 to explore the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA. Cohort studies and case series meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this review. RESULTS: We identified 14 eligible studies, 9 of which were cohort and 5 were case series. A total of 203,761 patients with COVID-19 were identified (7718 PLWHA vs. 196,043 non-PLWHA). Meta-analyses estimated the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA was 0.774% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00393-0.01517] and 8.814% (95% CI 0.05766-0.13245) respectively. COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA do not seem to be associated with higher mortality, as compared to non-PLWHA [relative risk (RR) 0.96 (95% CI 0.88-1.06)]. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, RR 5.2 (95% CI 4.25-6.36), hypertension and chronic cardiac disease, RR 4.2 (95% CI 1.09-16.10), and chronic kidney disease, RR 8.43 (95% CI 5.49-12.93) were associated with an increased mortality in COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA were 0.774% and 8.814%, respectively. Since most of the included studies used unmatched populations, comparisons between PLWHA and non-PLWHA should be interpreted with caution.

Alemtuzumab is an immunosuppressive drug that induces lymphocytes depletion. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the frequency and severity of COVID-19 in a case series of patients treated with alemtuzumab in our center. METHODS: Ten patients with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS were phoned and asked about symptoms suggestive and COVID-19 using a semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age was 43.7  9.65 years old, and 8 (80%) were females. The mean time since disease diagnosis was 17.30  8.59 years, and all were patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Mean time from the last dose of Alemtuzumab was 9.80  6.64 months, and last lymphocyte count was 760  231 / L. Two patients (20%) developed symptoms highly suggestive of COVID-19. Disease duration was 2 and 7 days. None patient required hospital admission. Patients with COVID-19 symptoms had longer clinical course of MS. Conversely, we did not find statistically significant differences regarding age, EDSS, last lymphocyte count, and months since the last dose of alemtuzumab administered between patients having or not symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients receiving alemtuzumab showed very mild symptoms of COVID-19.

Mammalian transcriptomes are CpG-poor, and ZAP may have evolved to exploit this feature to specifically target non-self viral RNA. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that ZAP and its paralogue PARP12 share an ancestral gene that arose prior to extensive eukaryote divergence, and the ZAP lineage diverged from the PARP12 lineage in tetrapods. Notably, the CpG content of modern eukaryote genomes varies widely, and ZAP-like genes arose subsequent to the emergence of CpG-suppression in vertebrates. Human PARP12 exhibited no antiviral activity against wild type and CpG-enriched HIV-1, but ZAP proteins from several tetrapods had antiviral activity when expressed in human cells. In some cases, ZAP antiviral activity required a TRIM25 protein from the same or related species, suggesting functional co-evolution of these genes. Indeed, a hypervariable sequence in the N-terminal domain of ZAP contributed to species-specific TRIM25 dependence in antiviral activity assays. Crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with RNA sequencing revealed that ZAP proteins from human, mouse, bat and alligator exhibit a high degree of CpG-specificity, while some avian ZAP proteins appear more promiscuous. Together, these data suggest that the CpG- rich RNA directed antiviral activity of ZAP-related proteins arose in tetrapods, subsequent to the onset of CpG suppression in certain eukaryote lineages, with subsequent species-specific adaptation of cofactor requirements and RNA target specificity.","output":"Origin and evolution of the zinc finger antiviral protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Few large cohort studies have reported data on maternal, fetal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy. We report the outcome of infected pregnancies from a collaboration formed early during the pandemic between the investigators of two registries, the UK and Global Pregnancy and Neonatal outcomes in COVID-19 (PAN-COVID) study and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine (SONPM) National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry. METHODS: This was an analysis of data from the PAN-COVID registry (1 January to 25 July 2020), which includes pregnancies with suspected or confirmed maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage in pregnancy, and the AAP-SONPM National Perinatal COVID-19 registry (4 April to 8 August 2020), which includes pregnancies with positive maternal testing for SARS-CoV-2 from 14 days before delivery to 3 days after delivery. The registries collected data on maternal, fetal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes. The PAN-COVID results are presented overall for pregnancies with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and separately in those with confirmed infection. RESULTS: We report on 4005 pregnant women with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (1606 from PAN-COVID and 2399 from AAP-SONPM). For obstetric outcomes, in PAN-COVID overall and in those with confirmed infection in PAN-COVID and AAP-SONPM, respectively, maternal death occurred in 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.2% of cases, early neonatal death in 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.3% of cases and stillbirth in 0.5%, 0.6% and 0.4% of cases. Delivery was preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation) in 12.0% of all women in PAN-COVID, in 16.1% of those women with confirmed infection in PAN-COVID and in 15.7% of women in AAP-SONPM. Extreme preterm delivery (< 27 weeks' gestation) occurred in 0.5% of cases in PAN-COVID and 0.3% in AAP-SONPM. Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in 0.9% of all deliveries in PAN-COVID overall, in 2.0% in those with confirmed infection in PAN-COVID and in 1.8% in AAP-SONPM; the proportions of neonates tested were 9.5%, 20.7% and 87.2%, respectively. The rates of a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate were 8.2% in PAN-COVID overall, 9.7% in those with confirmed infection and 9.6% in AAP-SONPM. Mean gestational-age-adjusted birth-weight Z-scores were -0.03 in PAN-COVID and -0.18 in AAP-SONPM. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the UK and USA registries of pregnancies with SARS-CoV-2 infection were remarkably concordant. Preterm delivery affected a higher proportion of women than expected based on historical and contemporaneous national data. The proportions of pregnancies affected by stillbirth, a SGA infant or early neonatal death were comparable to those in historical and contemporaneous UK and USA data. Although maternal death was uncommon, the rate was higher than expected based on UK and USA population data, which is likely explained by underascertainment of women affected by milder or asymptomatic infection in pregnancy in the PAN-COVID study, although not in the AAP-SONPM study. The data presented support strong guidance for enhanced precautions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, particularly in the context of increased risks of preterm delivery and maternal mortality, and for priority vaccination of pregnant women and women planning pregnancy.

DESIGN This was a descriptive, retrospective-cohort observational study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING The sample comprised 417 adults admitted to an urban community hospital licensed for 249 acute and 52 acute rehabilitation beds in Charleston, South Carolina, and referred to WOC nurses for evaluation and treatment. METHODS Prevalence and incidence rates were calculated from data previously collected for quality improvement purposes from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, by the WOC nurses and documented in a secure, password-protected electronic spreadsheet. The prevalence of IAD/ITD was calculated as the proportion of patients diagnosed with IAD/ITD on admission to our facility. The incidence of IAD and ITD was calculated as percentage of patients who developed IAD/ITD during the course of their hospital stay. All units in the hospital were included. RESULTS The mean prevalence of IAD present on admission was 16%; the prevalence decreased over the data collection period; it was 21% in 2014, 15% in 2015, and 13% in 2016. The mean incidence of hospital-acquired IAD during the data collection period was 23%; the highest rate (26%) occurred in 2016. Patients classified as normal weight from their body mass index and patients 60 years and older had the highest incidence of hospital-acquired IAD. The mean prevalence of ITD for patients admitted to the hospital was 40% for the 3-year time; annual rates varied from a low of 36% in 2015 to a high of 42% in 2016. The mean incidence of hospital-acquired ITD was 33% over the data collection period; mean incidence rates were 32% in 2014, 39% in 2015, and 29% in 2016. The incidence of ITD was higher in patients classified as obese based on body mass index in patients 60 years and older. The most common location was the gluteal cleft. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of IAD fell within the range of prior epidemiologic studies, but the facility-acquired IAD incidence rates were higher than other studies based in the acute care setting. The prevalence of ITD was higher than rates reported in prior studies; we searched the literature and found no previous reports of ITD occurrences over the course of a hospital stay.

Diet, in particular the microbiota accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fiber, is one of the most powerful ways to affect the composition and metabolic output of the gut microbiome. As such, diet is a powerful tool for understanding the biology of C. difficile and for developing alternative approaches for coping with this pathogen. One prominent class of metabolites produced by the gut microbiome are short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the major metabolic end products of MAC metabolism. SCFAs are known decrease the fitness of C. difficile in vitro and that high intestinal SCFA concentrations are associated with reduced fitness of C. difficile in animal models of C. difficile infection (CDI). Here, we use controlled dietary conditions (8 diets that differ only by MAC composition) to show that C. difficile fitness is most consistently impacted by butyrate, rather than the other two prominent SCFAs (acetate and propionate), during murine model CDI. We similarly show that butyrate concentrations are lower in fecal samples from humans with CDI relative to healthy controls. Finally, we demonstrate that butyrate impacts growth in diverse C. difficile isolates. These findings provide a foundation for future work which will dissect how butyrate directly impacts C. difficile fitness and will lead to the development of diverse approaches distinct from antibiotics or fecal transplant, such as dietary interventions, for mitigating CDI in at-risk human populations. IMPORTANCE Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea in humans and it imposes a tremendous burden on the healthcare system. Current treatments for C. difficile infection (CDI) include antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplant, which contribute to recurrent CDIs and face major regulatory hurdles, respectively. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to develop new ways to cope with CDI. Notably, a disrupted dysbiotic gut microbiota is the primary risk factor for CDI but we incompletely understand how a healthy microbiota resists CDI. Here, we show that a specific molecule produced by the gut microbiota, butyrate, is negatively associated with C. difficile burdens in humans and in a mouse model of CDI and that butyrate impedes the growth of diverse C. difficile strains in pure culture. These findings help to build a foundation for designing alternative, possibly diet-based, strategies for mitigating CDI in humans.","output":"Butyrate differentiates permissiveness to Clostridioides difficile infection and influences growth of diverse C. difficile isolates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Reports, mostly from high-income countries, have shown a wide range of symptoms, clinical profiles, and outcomes for patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

RESULTS: A total of 565 CMV qRT-PCR assays were performed using bronchial washing fluid from patients with hematologic malignancies. Among them, 101 were positive for CMV by qRT-PCR; of these, 24 were diagnosed with CMV pneumonia and 70 with CMV infection, and 7 were excluded due to a diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis rather than viral pneumonia. The median CMV load determined by qPCR was 1.8  10(5) copies/mL (3.6 10(3)-1.5  10(8)) in CMV pneumonia patients and 3.0  10(3) copies/mL (5.0  10(2)-1.1  10(5)) in those diagnosed with CMV infection (P < 0.01). Using the ROC curve, the optimal inflection points were 18,900 copies/mL (137,970 IU/mL) in post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients, 316,415 copies/mL (2,309,825 IU/mL) in no-BMT patients and 28,774 copies/mL (210,054 IU/mL) in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The CMV titers in bronchial washing fluid determined by qRT-PCR differed significantly between patients diagnosed with CMV pneumonia and those with CMV infection. The viral cut-off values in bronchial washing fluid were suggested for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia, which were different depending on the BMT status.","output":"Diagnosis of cytomegalovirus pneumonia by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using bronchial washing fluid from patients with hematologic malignancies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper revisits and elaborates on the improbable concept of economic law which originated in early twentieth-century debates in search of an legal political framework for a capitalist economy under democratic control.

By placing the deconstruction of economic law in the context of state transformation and globalization, on the one hand, and mainstream legal theory with its tendency to name a legal field rather than to explore what this name can explain, on the other, economic law emerges as a critical tool and methodology.

This study used Photovoice to capture reflections on how the lives of volunteers are affected by their work on behalf of immigrant family detainees. Participants were recruited over a two-month period in 2018 from amongst the volunteers of a non-governmental organization that provides legal services to the detainees at one immigration detention center. Participants submitted photos and captions that explored their experiences with their work. Thirteen volunteers consented to participate and submitted 44 photos with captions to the project. Major themes included emotional challenges of the work, frustrations with the U.S. government, comparison of their experiences to those of their clients, and finding uplifting moments.

Importantly, we have identified a relaxation of peripheral tolerance within early antibody secreting cells that emerge in patients with COVID-19 as important drivers of those responses. While often viral-specific, these extrafollicular-derived cells also display cross reactivity to autoantigens present in the inflammatory lung environment, and despite resolution of most autoreactivity within 6 months, they persisted in some patients. These results raise questions regarding autoreactive antibodies that arise during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and their persistence in patients with symptoms in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Through clinical autoreactive antibody screening of 95 patients with PASC and no history of autoimmune disease, we identify significant autoreactive profiles in patients with ongoing symptoms post-recovery, with 80% of patients returning positive tests for at least one autoantigen, and 40% showing breaks in tolerance to 2 or more. Anti-nuclear antigen positivity was most common, displaying positivity in 63% of patients, however, positive tests were broad and included reactivities against carbamylated protein responses, RNA polymerase III, and phospholipids. We also identify patients with reactivity against dsDNA in the PASC cohort - a reactivity not observed in acute infection even in the critically ill. These results demonstrate evidence of elevated serum autoantibodies in patients who present to PASC clinics with persistent symptoms up 14 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and further confirm the growing linkage between COVID-19 and observed clinical autoreactivity - even into the recovery phase of disease.","output":"Evidence of Persisting Autoreactivity in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kolkata is the third-most populous metropolitan area in India after Delhi and Mumbai, known as eastern Indias cultural, educational, and commercial centre.

We investigated the presence of short-lived relative cross-protection conferred by specific prior viral infections against subsequent febrile respiratory illness (FRI). METHODS: Men enlisted in basic military training between December 2009 and December 2014 were recruited, with the first FRI as the study entry point. ResPlex II assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect viral pathogens in nasal wash samples, and survival analyses were performed to determine whether infection with particular viruses conferred short-lived relative cross-protection against FRI. RESULTS: Prior infection with adenovirus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], .14C.44) or influenza virus (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, .38C.73) conferred relative protection against subsequent FRI episode. Results were statistically significant even after adjustment for the interval between enlistment and FRI (P < .001). Adenovirus-positive participants with FRI episodes tended to be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and influenza virus (P = .062C.093), while men with influenza virusCpositive FRI episodes tended be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus (P = .044) and influenza virus (P = .081).

Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease with unspecific symptoms, but about 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure. An unknown proportion of infected individuals never experience COVID-19 symptoms although they are infectious, that is, they remain asymptomatic. Those who develop the disease, go through a presymptomatic period during which they are infectious. Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically, could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. OBJECTIVES We conducted a rapid review to assess (1) the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with no screening and (2) the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS An information specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database up to 26 May 2020. We searched Embase.com, the CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Covid-19 Study Register on 14 April 2020. We searched LitCovid to 4 April 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases and in PubMed up to 15 April 2020. We also searched three model repositories (Covid-Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS], and Society for Medical Decision Making) on 8 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Trials, observational studies, or mathematical modelling studies assessing screening effectiveness or screening accuracy among general populations in which the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 is unknown. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS After pilot testing review forms, one review author screened titles and abstracts. Two review authors independently screened the full text of studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Abstracts excluded by a first review author were dually reviewed by a second review author prior to exclusion. One review author independently extracted data, which was checked by a second review author for completeness and accuracy. Two review authors independently rated the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for diagnostic accuracy studies and a modified form designed originally for economic evaluations for modelling studies. We resolved differences by consensus. We synthesized the evidence in narrative and tabular formats. We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included 22 publications. Two modelling studies reported on effectiveness of universal screening. Twenty studies (17 cohort studies and 3 modelling studies) reported on screening test accuracy. Effectiveness of screening We included two modelling studies. One study suggests that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases (assuming 10 or 100 infected travellers per week reduced the delay in a local outbreak to 8 days or 1 day, respectively). We assessed risk of bias as minor or no concerns, and certainty of evidence was low, downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study provides very low-certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). The certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening. Screening test accuracy All 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All but one study reported on the accuracy of single point-in-time screening and varied widely in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, settings, and methods of measurement. We assessed the overall risk of bias as unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. We rated one study as being at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalences. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. For single point-in-time strategies, for symptom assessment, the sensitivity from 12 cohorts (524 people) ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 (very low-certainty evidence) and the specificity from 12 cohorts (16,165 people) ranged from 0.66 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For screening using direct temperature measurement (3 cohorts, 822 people), international travel history (2 cohorts, 13,080 people), or exposure to known infected people (3 cohorts, 13,205 people) or suspected infected people (2 cohorts, 954 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (very low- to low-certainty evidence) and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 1.00 (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). For symptom assessment plus direct temperature measurement (2 cohorts, 779 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 (very low-certainty evidence) and specificity from 0.90 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For rapid PCR test (1 cohort, 21 people), sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; very low-certainty evidence). One cohort (76 people) reported on repeated screening with symptom assessment and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies evaluated the accuracy of screening at airports. The main outcomes measured were cases missed or detected by entry or exit screening, or both, at airports. One study suggests very low sensitivity at 0.30 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.53), missing 70% of infected travellers. Another study described an unrealistic scenario to achieve a 90% detection rate, requiring 0% asymptomatic infections. The final study provides very uncertain evidence due to low methodological quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening comes from two mathematical modelling studies and is limited by their assumptions. Low-certainty evidence suggests that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. This review highlights the uncertainty and variation in accuracy of screening strategies. A high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. Further studies need to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. More research is also needed on reference standards with greater accuracy than RT-PCR. Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.","output":"Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection: a rapid review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis-induced immunosuppression involves both innate and adaptive immunity and is associated with the increased expression of checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed cell-death protein 1 (PD-1). The expression of PD-1 is associated with poor outcomes in septic patients, and in models of sepsis, blocking PD-1 or its ligands with antibodies increased survival and alleviated immune suppression. While inhibitory antibodies are effective, they can lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs), in part due to continual blockade of the PD-1 pathway, resulting in hyperactivation of the immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics are an alternative drug modality that provide a rapid pharmacokinetic profile, reducing the incidence of precipitating irAEs. We recently reported that the potent, peptide-based PD-1 checkpoint antagonist, LD01, improves T-cell responses. The goal of the current study was to determine whether LD01 treatment improved survival, bacterial clearance, and host immunity in the cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced murine polymicrobial sepsis model. LD01 treatment of CLP-induced sepsis significantly enhanced survival and decreased bacterial burden. Altered survival was associated with improved macrophage phagocytic activity and T-cell production of interferon-. Further, myeloperoxidase levels and esterase-positive cells were significantly reduced in LD01-treated mice. Taken together, these data establish that LD01 modulates host immunity and is a viable therapeutic candidate for alleviating immunosuppression that characterizes sepsis and other infectious diseases.","output":"A PEPTIDE-BASED CHECKPOINT IMMUNOMODULATOR ALLEVIATES IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION IN MURINE POLYMICROBIAL SEPSIS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious complication of chronic liver disease, characterised by portal hypertension and arterial hypoxaemia due to intrapulmonary vascular dilatation.

To better understand the prognostic role of autoantibodies in COVID-19, we quantified autoantibodies against 23 markers that are used for diagnosis of autoimmune disease. To this end, we used serum samples from patients with severe [intensive care unit (ICU)] and moderate (ward) COVID-19, across two to six consecutive time points, and compared autoantibody levels to uninfected healthy and ICU controls. METHODS: Acute and post-acute serum (from 1 to 26 ICU days) was collected from 18 ICU COVID-19-positive patients at three to six time points; 18 ICU COVID-19-negative patients (sampled on ICU day 1 and 3); 21 ward COVID-19-positive patients (sampled on hospital day 1 and 3); and from 59 healthy uninfected controls deriving from two cohorts. Levels of IgG autoantibodies against 23 autoantigens, commonly used for autoimmune disease diagnosis, were measured in serum samples using MSD?

A previous Cochrane Review found Xpert MTB/RIF sensitive and specific for tuberculosis (Steingart 2014). Since the previous review, new studies have been published. We performed a review update for an upcoming WHO policy review. OBJECTIVES To determine diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for tuberculosis in adults with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and for rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.

SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized trials, cross-sectional, and cohort studies using respiratory specimens that evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra, or both against the reference standard, culture for tuberculosis and culture-based drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus for rifampicin resistance. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Four review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form. When possible, we also extracted data by smear and HIV status. We assessed study quality using QUADAS-2 and performed meta-analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity separately for tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity. Most analyses used a bivariate random-effects model. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated accuracy using all included studies and then only the subset of studies where participants were unselected, i.e. not selected based on prior microscopy testing. MAIN RESULTS We identified in total 95 studies (77 new studies since the previous review): 86 studies (42,091 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for tuberculosis and 57 studies (8287 participants) for rifampicin resistance.

Governments spent heavily to reduce poverty and strengthen their own legitimacy. However, as government rents faded, subsidy spending became financially unsustainable and foreign donors pressed for reforms. Yet, reform has been challenging for all the governments as subsidies affect all consumers, therefore raising the risk of government delegitimisation. Several publications have analysed the subsidy reforms of various MENA countries, but few have systematically analysed their impacts on the prevailing social contracts. This paper shows that reforms in a key policy field such as subsidy spending can affect the nature of social contracts profoundly and distinctly, depending on the reform strategy. It assesses the reform processes that took place in Morocco, Egypt and Iran primarily between 2010 and 2017, thus before the United States once more tightened sanctions against Iran and before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. We argue that governments applied distinct strategies to reduce subsidy spending without provoking major social unrest to reforms, with the effect that the social contracts of the three countries changed in quite different ways. Moroccos government removed most subsidies, especially those that predominantly benefitted the middle-class. It explained the need for reforms, engaged in dialogue with society and implemented some compensatory measures for the poor. Thereby it succeeded in preserving substantial features of its prevailing social contract. The Egyptian government, in contrast, dismantled subsidy schemes more radically but without systematic information and consultation campaigns. Also, its compensatory measures remain limited, which shows that the government no longer relied on social benefits as a means of legitimisation. Instead, by using repression and a narrative of collective security, the emerging social contract has been transformed from being a provision to being a protection pact. Finally, Iran replaced subsidies with a generous quasi-universal cash transfer scheme, which was more cost-efficient and egalitarian. Even if inflation and external shocks eroded these benefits, the reform paved the way to a more inclusive social contract, at least for a couple of years. Lessons learnt from past social transfer reform strategies will be all the more interesting for MENA governments once they embark on post-COVID-19 reconstruction strategies, which are likely to compensate households for financial losses made during the COVID-19 crisis and help them make a new start in economic terms.","output":"Subsidy reforms in the Middle East and North Africa: Strategic options and their consequences for the social contract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This qualitative phenomenological study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of patients living with chronic pain.

METHODS PubMed, EMBASE.com and Cochrane Library were searched in January 2021 for preclinical studies of hemorrhagic shock using any therapeutic agent on top of standard fluid resuscitation. Primary outcome was vascular leakage, defined as edema, macromolecule extravasation or glycocalyx degradation. Drugs were classified by targeting pathways and subgroup analyses were performed per organ. RESULTS Forty-five studies, published between 1973 and 2020, fulfilled eligibility criteria. The included studies tested 54 different therapeutics mainly in pulmonary and intestinal vascular beds. Most studies induced trauma besides hemorrhagic shock. Forty-four therapeutics (81%) were found effective to reduce microvascular leakage, edema formation or glycocalyx degradation in at least one organ. Targeting oxidative stress and apoptosis was the predominantly effective strategy (SMD: -2.18, CI [-3.21,-1.16], P < 0.0001). Vasoactive agents were found non-effective in reducing microvascular leakage (SMD: -0.86, CI [-3.07,1.36], P = 0.45). CONCLUSION Pharmacological modulation of pathways involved in cell metabolism, inflammation, endothelial barrier regulation, sex hormones and especially oxidative stress and apoptosis were effective in reducing microvascular leakage in experimental hemorrhagic shock with fluid resuscitation. Future studies should investigate whether targeting these pathways can restore microcirculatory perfusion and reduce organ injury following hemorrhagic shock.

There are circumstances when these feelings can overwhelm a person leading to demoralization and potentially a moral injury. Spiritual practices and advice may help to deal with moral paradoxes and ethical dilemmas when other secular supports are undermined or inaccessible. The Holy Indian Epic, the Bhagvad Gita has described the moral distress of the warrior Arjuna, during the battle of Kurukshetra and the advice given to him by the Lord Krishna the gist of which can be encapsulated in the form of the four Ds- Detachment, Duty, Doer-ship and Dhyana or meditation.

Cancer patients are considered a vulnerable population to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may develop several COVID-19 symptoms. The heightened immunocompromised state, prolonged chronic pro-inflammatory milieu coupled with comorbid conditions are shared in both disease conditions and may influence patient outcome. Although ovarian cancer (OC) and COVID-19 are diseases of entirely different primary organs, both diseases share similar molecular and cellular characteristics in their microenvironment suggesting a potential cooperativity leading to poor outcome. In COVID-19 related cases, hospitalizations and deaths worldwide are lower in women than in males; however, comorbidities associated with OC may increase the COVID-19 risk in women. The women at the age of 50-60 years are at greater risk of developing OC as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased levels of gonadotropin and androgen, dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), hyper-coagulation and chronic inflammation are common conditions observed among OC and severe cases of COVID-19. The upregulation of common inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-?3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), among others in the sera of COVID-19 and OC subjects suggests potentially similar mechanism(s) involved in the hyper-inflammatory condition observed in both disease states. Thus, it is conceivable that the pathogenesis of OC may significantly contribute to the potential infection by SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: In order to explore this phenomenon, we sought to compare the early immune responses against AZD1222 and BNT162b2. SARS-CoV-2 seronegative participants received a single dose of either vaccine and were analyzed for immune cell, effector T cell, and antibody dynamics. RESULTS: AZD1222 induced transient leukopenia and major changes among innate and adaptive subpopulations. Both vaccines induced spike protein-specific effector T cells which were dominated by type 1 helper T cell responses following AZD1222 vaccination. A significant reduction of anti-inflammatory T cells upon re-stimulation was also restricted to AZD1222 vaccinees. While IgM and IgG were the dominant isotypes elicited by AZD1222, BNT162b2 led to a significant production of IgG and IgA.

Operative and convalescence parameters were compared, as were intra- and postoperative complications within 90 days according to the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association of baseline characteristics with complications. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups, except for American Society of Anesthesiologists score II (10.0% vs 43.3%; P = .007). All procedures were completed as planned. All operative and convalescence parameters of donors and graft outcomes were similar in the 2 groups, as were overall rates of intraoperative (43.3% vs 36.7%, P = .598) and postoperative (86.7% vs 70.0%; P = .209) complications. No factor was significantly predictive of intraoperative complications, whereas sex (female vs male, odds ratio, 0.183; P = .029) and learning curve (odds ratio, 0.602; P = .036) were significant determinants of postoperative complication.

The reason was apprehension of undoing of the status quo that has had remained primordial and backed by religious sanctions for social stratification. Therefore, idea of affirmative action towards disadvantaged sections in education in general and higher education in particular has faced stiff resistance by the conservative (status quoist) forces with ideas such as merit, efficiency and promotion of liberalization. However, with the limited implementation of the affirmative action policies such conservative idea was challenged, and representation of the disadvantaged sections was ensured, albeit partially. As a result, glimmerings of hope could be seen alongside with the amelioration of the disadvantaged statuses and (partial) inclusive development. But the present government with their covert strategies has always wished to hamper such inclusive idea in education. And amidst the present pandemic COVID-19 situation, they have found the golden opportunity to blow such development by arbitrarily shifting the policies pertaining to education to cause subtle exclusion of the disadvantaged groups. Such a shift in the policies is deliberate as has been proposed as universal and non-temporary change especially in higher education, that is, changes have been introduced with post-pandemic effect. Also, this change that has tendency for leaning towards liberalization/privatization can be seen as a logical continuation of their policies for withdrawal of the state from providing (higher) education in terms of continuous reduction in allotment of budget towards education.

This study examined parental HPV vaccine knowledge and adolescent HPV vaccine initiation among multiethnic parents in NJ, where access to language concordant HPV vaccine information and vaccination services may differ, for immigrant parents. METHODS: We surveyed parents of adolescents (ages 11C18) at community events in NJ to examine parental HPV vaccine knowledge and adolescent HPV vaccine uptake. Vaccine knowledge was assessed using an 11-item question stem that covered vaccine efficacy, gender recommendation, vaccine protection, and myths. Multivariable models assessed the association of parent nativity on HPV vaccine knowledge scores and adolescent HPV vaccine initiation, controlling for sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: Of the 77 parents, most parents (84%) were aware of the HPV vaccine. However, knowledge scores were low and differed by parent nativity. Non-U.S. born parents had significantly lower knowledge scores ? 1.7 [? 3.1, ? 0.4] and lower odds of adolescent children initiating the HPV vaccine 0.3 [0.1, 0.9] compared to U.S.-born parents after adjusting demographic characteristics.

Beyond economical, nutritional, socio-cultural, and religious functions, the inherent adaptability of indigenous birds to diverse environmental conditions also provides a unique genetic resource critical for addressing the global challenges of food security in this world impacted by climatic change and human population growth. Nevertheless, until recently, the potential of the indigenous chicken remained largely untapped for no strong reason. In this review, we offer an overview of food and nutritional security with a special focus on chicken breeding in East Africa. We highlighted and combined confirming evidence of production performance, phenotypic variability, and genetic diversity of East African indigenous chicken using both morphological and molecular tools. Previous attempts to improve the productivity of indigenous chicken are highlighted, and possible future breeding plans and areas of immediate research are suggested. Considering how indigenous chicken strongly affects the livelihood of the majority of households, and since the poultry sector is likely to be strongly affected by climate change, we recommended that the prospects of chicken breeding in Africa should create a permanent balance between the competing needs of genetic improvement and the genetic diversity of indigenous chickens. ABSTRACT: The focus of this review is to offer an overview of food and nutritional security, to identify associated constraints, and propose possible alternative solutions for improving the East African poultry sub-sector in the pursuit of food security, focusing on chicken breeding. To better understand the prospects of the poultry industry, we highlighted and combined confirming evidence of the phenotypic variability and genetic diversity of East African chicken genetic resources using both morphological and molecular tools, as well as performance traits. Furthermore, this work gives a detailed indication of what would be lost if indigenous chicken populations are left to suffer the ongoing massive genetic erosions due to various factors, not limited to indiscriminate crossbreeding. Previous and recent attempts to improve the productivity of indigenous chicken are highlighted, and possible future breeding plans and areas of immediate research are suggested as well. This review concludes that under the prevailing conditions, the village chicken production system appears to be the most imperious production system that needs to be extensively developed ; however, for the sustainability of the industry, the proposed improvement strategies should create a permanent balance between the competing needs of genetic improvement and the genetic diversity of the indigenous chicken genetic resource.","output":"Overview of Poultry Management as a Key Factor for Solving Food and Nutritional Security with a Special Focus on Chicken Breeding in East African Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide pandemic The aim of this study was to evaluate associations of plasma 25(OH)D levels with the likelihood of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and hospitalization The study population included the 14 000 members of Leumit Health Services, who were tested for COVID-19 infection from February 1st to April 30th, 2020, and who had at least one previous blood test for the plasma 25(OH)D level 'Suboptimal' or 'low' plasma 25(OH)D level was defined as plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, concentration below the level of 30 ng/mL Of 7807 individuals, 782 (10 02%) were COVID-19-positive, and 7025 (89 98%) COVID-19-negative The mean plasma vitamin D level was significantly lower among those who tested positive than negative for COVID-19 [19 00 ng/mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 18 41-19 59) vs 20 55 (95% CI: 20 32-20 78)] Univariate analysis demonstrated an association between the low plasma 25(OH)D level and increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection [crude odds ratio (OR) of 1 58 (95% CI: 1 24-2 01, P &lt; 0 001)], and of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [crude OR of 2 09 (95% CI: 1 01-4 30, P &lt; 0 05)] In multivariate analyses that controlled for demographic variables, and psychiatric and somatic disorders, the adjusted OR of COVID-19 infection [1 45 (95% CI: 1 08-1 95, P &lt; 0 001)] and of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [1 95 (95% CI: 0 98-4 845, P = 0 061)] were preserved In the multivariate analyses, age over 50 years, male gender and low-medium socioeconomic status were also positively associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection;age over 50 years was positively associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19 We concluded that low plasma 25(OH)D levels appear to be an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection and hospitalization","output":"Low plasma 25(OH) vitamin D level is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 infection: an Israeli population-based study.

Although they signal through distinct receptors, type I (IFN-/) and type III IFNs elicit remarkably similar responses in cells.

IFN- is much more potent than IFN-/ at controlling rotavirus infection. In contrast, clearance of several other viruses, such as influenza virus, mostly depends on IFN-/. The IFN- receptor was reported to be preferentially expressed on epithelial cells. Cells responsible for IFN- production are still poorly characterized but seem to overlap only partly IFN-/-producing cells.

ALP, phosphorus levels, and iPTH suppression rates were higher in hypercalcemic patients (P < .001, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively), while the iPTH level was significantly lower in hypercalcemic patients (P < .001) than in normocalcemic patients. Amongst the three groups with different 25(OH)D levels, no difference was found in levels of iPTH, calcium, phosphorus, ALP, or age. CONCLUSION: Most patients with very high vitamin D levels were normocalcemic, but severe hypercalcemia was also observed.

In this study, we describe the mutational landscape of the Omicron variant using amino acid interaction (AAI) networks. AAI network analysis is particularly well suited for interrogating the impact of constellations of mutations as occur on Omicron that may function in an epistatic manner. Our analyses suggest that as compared to previous variants of concern, the Omicron variant has increased antibody escape breadth due to mutations in class 3 and 4 antibody epitopes as well as increased escape depth due to accumulated mutations in class 1 antibody epitopes. We note certain RBD mutations that might further enhance Omicrons escape, and in particular advise careful surveillance of two subclades bearing R346S/K mutations with relevance for certain therapeutic antibodies. Further, AAI network analysis suggests that the function of certain therapeutic monoclonal antibodies may be disrupted by Omicron mutations as a result of the cumulative indirect perturbations to the epitope surface properties, despite point-mutation analyses suggesting these antibodies are tolerant of the set of Omicron mutations in isolation. Finally, for several Omicron mutations that do not appear to contribute meaningfully to antibody escape, we find evidence for a plausible role in enhanced transmissibility via disruption of RBD-down conformational stability at the RBD-RBD interface.","output":"Insights on the mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the disease caused by novel coronavirus which belongs to family Coronavirinae.

The key advantage of the CIC model as compared to the standard difference-in-difference model is that CIC allows for mean and variance of the outcomes to change over time in the absence of any policy intervention, and CIC accounts for endogeneity in the choice of policy intervention. Our results indicate that in contrast to Sweden, which did not impose a national lockdown, Germany, and to some extent, the US were the two countries where nationwide lockdown had a significant impact on the reduction in COVID-19 related total and daily deaths per million people. In Norway and Denmark, there was no significant impact on total and daily deaths per million people relative to Sweden. Whereas in other countries; Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK, the effect of the lockdown was in the opposite direction, that is, they experienced significantly higher COVID-19 related total and daily deaths per million people, post the lockdown as compared to Sweden.

On that date, there were 134,576 reported cases and 4981 deaths worldwide. By March 26, 2020, just 2 weeks later, reported cases had increased four-fold to 531,865, and deaths increased five-fold to 24,073. Older people are both major users of telehealth services and are more likely to die as a result of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the extent that Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, during the 2 weeks following the pandemic announcement, sought to promote telehealth as a tool that could help identify COVID-19 among older people who may live alone, be frail, or be self-isolating, and give support to or facilitate the treatment of people who are or may be infected. METHODS: This paper reports, for the 2-week period previously mentioned and immediately prior, on activities and initiatives in the three countries taken by governments or their agencies (at national or state levels) together with publications or guidance issued by professional, trade, and charitable bodies. Different sources of information are drawn upon that point to the perceived likely benefits of telehealth in fighting the pandemic. It is not the purpose of this paper to draw together or analyze information that reflects growing knowledge about COVID-19, except where telehealth is seen as a component. RESULTS: The picture that emerges for the three countries, based on the sources identified, shows a number of differences. These differences center on the nature of their health services, the extent of attention given to older people (and the circumstances that can relate to them), the different geographies (notably concerned with rurality), and the changes to funding frameworks that could impact these. Common to all three countries is the value attributed to maintaining quality safeguards in the wider context of their health services but where such services are noted as sometimes having precluded significant telehealth use. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing changes and may help to establish telehealth more firmly in its aftermath. Some of the changes may not be long-lasting. However, the momentum is such that telehealth will almost certainly find a stronger place within health service frameworks for each of the three countries and is likely to have increased acceptance among both patients and health care providers.","output":"Telehealth in the Context of COVID-19: Changing Perspectives in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of in vitro and in vivo studies has shown that EAF2 can affect multiple signaling pathways involved in cellular processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects have remained elusive. Here we report the discovery of a new functional link between EAF2 and TGF- signaling.

Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that EAF2 specifically interacts with Smad3 in vitro and in vivo but not with other Smad proteins. In addition, we observed that EAF2 binding does not alter Smad3 phosphorylation but causes Smad3 cytoplasmic retention, competes with Smad4 for binding to Smad3, and prevents p300-Smad3 complex formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that EAF2 suppresses both TGF--induced G1 cell cycle arrest and TGF--induced cell migration.

The testing process is introduced and applied to the Covid-19 data. RESULTS: Based on the information, the proposed test is interpreted as the probability that there is no reduction in uncertainty of Covid-19 is accepted with a probability of 0.95, committing a type-I error is 0.05 with the measure of an indeterminacy 0.10.

New approaches for encouraging healthy lifestyles are needed to reduce hypertension and promote health equity in Black communities. OBJECTIVE: In this report, we describe the early-stage, virtual design of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) to increase physical activity in partnership with members of a low-income, predominantly Black community. METHODS: The hallmark of JITAIs is highly contextualized mobile app push notifications. Thus, understanding participants' context and determinants of physical activity are critical. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted virtual discovery interviews and analysis guided by the Behavior Change Wheel (which focuses on participants' capacity, opportunity, and motivation to engage in physical activity), as well as empathy mapping. We then formed a community-academic participatory design team that partnered in the design sprint, storyboarding, and paper prototyping. RESULTS: For this study, 5 community members participated in the discovery interviews, 12 stakeholders participated in the empathy mapping, 3 community members represented the community on the design team, and 10 community members provided storyboard or paper prototyping feedback. Only one community member had used videoconferencing prior to partnering with the academic team, and none had design experience. A set of 5 community-academic partner design principles were created: (1) keep users front and center, (2) tailor to the individual, (3) draw on existing motivation, (4) make physical activity feel approachable, and (5) make data collection transparent yet unobtrusive. To address community-specific barriers, the community-academic design team decided that mobile app push notifications will be tailored to participants baseline mobility level and community resources (eg, local parks and events). Push notifications will also be tailored based on the day (weekday versus weekend), time of day, and weather. Motivation will be enhanced via adaptive goal setting with supportive feedback and social support via community-generated notifications. CONCLUSIONS: We completed early-stage virtual design of a JITAI in partnership with community participants and a community design team with limited design and videoconferencing experience. We found that designing JITAIs with the community enables these interventions to address community-specific needs, which may lead to a more meaningful impact on users' health.","output":"A Physical Activity Just-in-time Adaptive Intervention Designed in Partnership With a Predominantly Black Community: Virtual, Community-Based Participatory Design Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A lack of follow-up of violence incidents and assaulted staff has been associated with high levels of workplace violence.

METHODS: This qualitative study comprised two focus groups with Emergency Department nurses. Data were analysed thematically. COREQ guidelines were followed for the design and reporting of the study. RESULTS: The barriers to follow-up in this study relate to the type of perpetrator, the initial incident response, the incident reporting process and organisational action. The enablers included hospital initiatives to manage violence and support staff wellbeing. The opportunities included strategies to improve follow-up and ideas for new follow-up strategies.

Quantitative results showed statistically significant differences in physical fitness measures including cardio-respiratory endurance, lower body strength, balance, speed, and agility. Trends were seen in six of nine cognitive skills. During Covid the program was transformed into an online format as BrainSavers Synapse: Staying Connected, which has been enthusiastically received.

The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, dialysis patients with coronavirus disease were divided into groups depending on the severity of the disease. The second stage of the study was determined the influence of age, duration of dialysis treatment, gender, cause of chronic kidney disease VD, obesity, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular pathology on the course of coronavirus disease, as well as complications and mortality from COVID-19 among the dialysis population. Results: 155 cases of COVID-19 were registered among 764 dialysis patients. Mild coronavirus disease was diagnosed in 38 (24.5%) patients, moderate and severe in 64 (41.3%) and 53 (34.2%) patients, respectively. Oxygen support was required for 76 patients (79%), and artificial lung ventilation was used for 17 (10.9%) patients. Factors associated with severe coronavirus disease in this category of patients were found to be obesity (BMI> 30 kg / m2), diabetes mellitus, concomitant cardiovascular disease, and the need for oxygen support. In this category of patients, obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2), cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and require supplement oxygen are associated with severe Coronavirus disease COVID-19. There was no significant effect on the severity of coronavirus disease in the age of patients and duration of dialysis treatment. The duration of treatment in patients with diabetes was significantly higher (p <0.05), a direct strong correlation between BMI and duration of treatment was demonstrated. Survival was significantly higher in the group of patients who did not require oxygen support (78% vs. 56%) and had a BMI <30 kg / m2 (87% vs. 37%). Conclusions: the incidence of coronavirus disease among the dialysis cohort was 20.2% of cases. Patients treated with peritoneal dialysis had a significantly lower incidence. Severe coronavirus disease has been associated with obesity, cardiovascular disease, and the need for oxygen support. Men were more likely to have COVID-19 than women. There is no connection between the severe course of coronavirus disease with the age of patients and the duration of dialysis treatment. The duration of treatment of Coronavirus disease in the group of patients with diabetes and high BMI was longer.

The continuous spread and great pandemic potential of MERS-CoV make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines. We previously demonstrated that the application of Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a bacterial vector displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies. We have also used the rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV S1 (spike) protein on the surface of the RV. In this study, we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in BALB/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. The results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the GEM particles vector. However, the GEM particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response, even at a very low dose of 1 g. These results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model.

VE against symptomatic Omicron infection was 62% (95%CI, 49-72%) []7 days following a third dose. Discussion Two-dose VE against symptomatic Omicron infection wanes over time in adolescents. While lower than observed against Delta, protection against severe outcomes appears to be maintained over time. A third dose substantially improves protection against Omicron infection, but 3-dose VE is only moderate at approximately 60% in the early period following vaccination and the duration of this protection is unknown.","output":"Vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 against Omicron and Delta outcomes in adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a growing concern about the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during wastewater treatment and their potential impacts on the receiving water bodies. We hypothesised that the quantity of ARGs in effluents may be related to the size of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and sampling season. To date, only several attempts have been made to investigate the impact of the above factors at the catchment scale. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to explore possible differences in the quantity of ARGs in treated wastewater from small, medium-sized and large WWTPs in the catchment of the Pilica River (9258 km2). The impact of treated wastewater on the concentration of ARGs was also determined along the river continuum from upland to lowland segments to the point of confluence with the Vistula (342 km). Treated effluent was sampled in 17 WWTPs, and river water was sampled in 7 sampling sites in four seasons. The concentrations of blaTEM, tet(A), ermF, sul1 and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes, the integrase gene intI1 and the 16S rRNA gene were analysed by quantitative PCR. The physical and chemical parameters and nutrient concentrations (23 various parameters) in the analysed samples were determined. The highest absolute concentrations of the studied genes were noted in effluent samples from small WWTPs (p < 0.01). The concentration of ARGs (gene copies/mL) peaked in winter and spring samples (p < 0.04). The results of statistical analyses indicate that in small WWTPs, the absolute concentration of ARGs can be predicted based on the biochemical oxygen demand, in routine water analyses. However, none of the studied parameters supported predictions of ARG abundance in medium-sized and large WWTPs or in river water.","output":"The impact of WWTP size and sampling season on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in wastewater and the river system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Agroecology combines agronomic and ecological concepts. It relies on the enhancement of biodiversity and related ecosystem services to support agricultural production. It is dependent on biological interactions for the design and management of agricultural systems in agricultural landscapes. OBJECTIVES: We review the role of landscape ecology to understand and promote biodiversity, pest regulation and crop pollination for the designing of agroecology landscapes. We illustrate the use of landscape ecological methods for supporting agroforestry systems as an example of agroecological development, and we propose pathways to implement agroecology at landscape scale. METHODS: The state of the art of how landscape ecology contributes to agroecology development is summarized based on a literature review. RESULTS: Agroecology requires thinking beyond the field scale to consider the positioning, quality and connectivity of fields and semi-natural habitats at larger spatial scales. The spatial and temporal organisation of semi-natural elements and the crop mosaic interact. Understanding this interaction is the pre-requisite for promoting patterns and mechanisms that foster biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Promoting agroecological practices beyond individual farm borders can be rooted in a bottom-up approach from agroecological lighthouse farms to farm networks to amplify agroecology adoption at the landscape scale. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving agricultural landscapes composed of fields and farms following agroecological management requires understanding of biodiversity patterns, biological interactions and mechanisms that determine and boost ecosystem functioning to improve services at landscape scale, involving farmers in a bottom-up and context-specific approach.","output":"Agroecology landscapes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, a substantial number of people are tormented by dystonia.

Due to the diffuse vasculo-endothelial damage, individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are at risk to develop severe clinical complications, if infected with coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).[1] Given this risk, a systematic evaluation of individuals with SCD presenting with COVID19 infection is paramount to identify the variable clinical manifestations and complications encountered in children and adults with SCD. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted from January to June 2020 at the Medical University of South Carolina. We included individuals with sickle cell disease of all genotypes, from 0 to 65 years of age found to be positive for COVID19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients' past medical history, clinical presentations, admissions, treatment, complications, and mortality data were reviewed. The data was collected with REDCap@ and descriptive data analysis was conducted per SPSS@. Results: Of the identified 23 patients with SCD who tested positive for COVID during the time specified, 19 (82.6%) had Hgb SS genotype, two had Hgb SC (9%) and two Hgb S+ thalassemia (9%) with similar incidence in both genders (47.8% male and 52.2 % female). All patients were African American. The mean age was 26.13+/-11.53 years. In the last three years they had admissions for pain at a mean of 4.29 +/- 5 and admissions for acute chest syndrome 1+/- 2.2. Six participants (26.1%) had history of mild asthma. Two (8.7%) had pulmonary hypertension. No participants had a history of silent stroke. One participant had history of ischemic stroke, three (13%) had history of pulmonary embolism, and six (26.1%) had deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A variable clinical presentation was noted in our population (Table 1). Of the 23, only nine (39%) required admission of which only one met criteria for intensive care (4.3%) requiring respiratory support with high flow nasal canula. All participants recovered well with the mean length of admission 4.36+/- 3.8 days. Treatment included supportive care including transfusion support, two (8.7%) needed simple transfusion, two (8.7%) needed exchange transfusion. Regarding the laboratory values, coagulations studies were noted to be elevated among all those obtained, but overall limited values were obtained. (Table 2) Thus far no complications of stroke, thrombosis, or pulmonary emboli are noted in the patients positive for COVID in sickle cell disease at our institution. No deaths were reported. Conclusion: Our population reflects what has been described thus far in other cohorts regarding patient demographics, clinical presentation and evolution of disease. Missing laboratory results is most likely due to the mild severity which did not require further clinical evaluation. The absence of VTE/PE may be explained by the low rate of ICU admissions. A similar ICU admission rate of 13% in the same age group as our population was described in a study conducted in France with 83 patients. [2] Compared to a study conducted in Detroit, Michigan, our population underwent comparable rates of transfusions with 3 patients compared to 4 in our population, again most likely due to the mild severity. [3] Our results reflect only MUSC's testing sites and we are dependent on patient's self-report which may not represent our entire population. To address this issue, as part of the Sickle Cell South Carolina network, we are partnering with two other institutions to assess SARS-Cov-2 infection in South Carolina. SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought to light many disparities encountered in the American health care system. It is premature to evaluate the immediate and long-term ramifications of COVID19 in individuals with sickle cell disease, due to which we plan to continue to monitor for the next 2 years.

Detection of viral RNA by a colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a simple, reliable and cost-effective assay, deployable in resource-limited settings (RLS). Our objective was to evaluate the intrinsic and extrinsic performances of RT-LAMP in RLS. METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective observational study of diagnostic accuracy, conducted from October 2020 to February 2021 in four African Countries: Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria; and in Italy. We enroled 1657 individuals who were either COVID-19 suspect cases, or asymptomatic and presented for screening. RNA extracted from pharyngeal swabs was tested in parallel by a colorimetric RT-LAMP and by a standard real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). FINDINGS: The sensitivity and specificity of index RT LAMP compared to standard RT-PCR on 1657 prospective specimens from infected individuals was determined. For a subset of 1292 specimens, which underwent exactly the same procedures in different countries, we obtained very high specificity (98%) and positive predictive value (PPV = 99%), while the sensitivity was 87%, with a negative predictive value NPV = 70%, Stratification of RT-PCR data showed superior sensitivity achieved with an RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) below 35 (97%), which decreased to 60% above 35. INTERPRETATION: In this field trial, RT-LAMP appears to be a reliable assay, comparable to RT-PCR, particularly with medium-high viral loads (Ct < 35). Hence, RT-LAMP can be deployed in RLS for timely management and prevention of COVID-19, without compromising the quality of output.","output":"Diagnostic performance of a colorimetric RT -LAMP for the identification of SARS-CoV-2: A multicenter prospective clinical evaluation in sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The CERN-MEDICIS (MEDical Isotopes Collected from ISolde) facility has delivered its first radioactive ion beam at CERN (Switzerland) in December 2017 to support the research and development in nuclear medicine using non-conventional radionuclides. Since then, fourteen institutes, including CERN, have joined the collaboration to drive the scientific program of this unique installation and evaluate the needs of the community to improve the research in imaging, diagnostics, radiation therapy and personalized medicine. The facility has been built as an extension of the ISOLDE (Isotope Separator On Line DEvice) facility at CERN. Handling of open radioisotope sources is made possible thanks to its Radiological Controlled Area and laboratory. Targets are being irradiated by the 1.4 GeV proton beam delivered by the CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) on a station placed between the High Resolution Separator (HRS) ISOLDE target station and its beam dump. Irradiated target materials are also received from external institutes to undergo mass separation at CERN-MEDICIS. All targets are handled via a remote handling system and exploited on a dedicated isotope separator beamline. To allow for the release and collection of a specific radionuclide of medical interest, each target is heated to temperatures of up to 2,300C. The created ions are extracted and accelerated to an energy up to 60 kV, and the beam steered through an off-line sector field magnet mass separator. This is followed by the extraction of the radionuclide of interest through mass separation and its subsequent implantation into a collection foil. In addition, the MELISSA (MEDICIS Laser Ion Source Setup At CERN) laser laboratory, in service since April 2019, helps to increase the separation efficiency and the selectivity. After collection, the implanted radionuclides are dispatched to the biomedical research centers, participating in the CERN-MEDICIS collaboration, for Research & Development in imaging or treatment.

To enable real-time monitoring of the incidence of mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - for which medical consultation might not be required - the Infectieradar web-based syndromic surveillance system was launched in mid-March 2020. Our aim was to quantify associations between Infectieradar participant characteristics and the incidence of self-reported COVID-19-like illness. Recruitment for this cohort study was via a web announcement. After registering, participants completed weekly questionnaires, reporting the occurrence of a set of symptoms. The incidence rate of COVID-19-like illness was estimated and multivariable Poisson regression used to estimate the relative risks associated with sociodemographic variables, lifestyle factors and pre-existing medical conditions. Between 17 March and 24 May 2020, 25 663 active participants were identified, who reported 7060 episodes of COVID-19-like illness over 131 404 person-weeks of follow-up. The incidence rate declined over the analysis period, consistent with the decline in notified cases. Male sex, age 65+ years and higher education were associated with a significantly lower COVID-19-like illness incidence rate (adjusted rate ratios (RRs) of 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84), 0.77 (0.70-0.85), 0.84 (0.80-0.88), respectively) and the baseline characteristics ever-smoker, asthma, allergies, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease and children in the household were associated with a higher incidence (RRs of 1.11 (1.04-1.19) to 1.69 (1.50-1.90)).

These are highly conserved and are not pathogen-specific, but are in response to classes of molecular structures. Infections can be perceived both extracellularly and intracellularly by Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and their host cell ligands, Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRRs), among them, Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs). The innate immune response to infection includes the release of soluble preformed mediators, or synthesis of cytoplasmic enzymes, cytokines, chemokines, interferons (IFNs), lipid mediators, proteins of the complement cascade, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, and components of transcription factors (High Mobility Group B1, receptors for sex hormones/steroids). Directed cellular migration of parenchymal astrocytes and microglia, as well as recruitment across the blood brain barrier (BBB) of circulating neutrophils, natural killer, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and ultimately T lymphocytes to the site of infection are also hallmarks of innate responses to infections. These responding cells contribute their own secreted effector molecules and effector activities (such as phagocytosis). Distinct viruses are capable of infecting every cell type (endothelial cells, ependymal cells, perivascular macrophages and pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, and neurons) in the central nervous system (CNS). These CNS infections challenge the host with a different set of problems than do peripheral viral infections. Among the complications are (a) neurons that rarely express Class I or Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules and are thus not suitable targets for either CD4(+) or CD8(+) MHC-restricted T cells, (b) an enclosed volume that is constrained from swelling during inflammation, as well as poorly developed lymphatic drainage, and (c) the immunologic privilege of the CNS which leads to extremely limited immune surveillance for pathogens. Therefore, the role of innate immunity, both from CNS-resident cells and their products, and from circulating inflammatory cells and molecules which traverse the BBB are essential to buy time, inhibiting viral replication and dissemination, until the host can marshal an adaptive immune response. The immune responses are crucial for host survival from the infection. Consequently, successful pathogens, especially those that persist, have developed a wide variety of evasive approaches to limit the inhibition of replication. Many of these pathways are highlighted in individual chapters that precede this one. These evasive measures range from neutralizing host secreted molecules (cytokines and chemokines) with soluble receptors, encoding anti-inflammatory proteins in their genome, preventing signal transduction, blocking inhibition of protein synthesis, degradation of essential antiviral molecules, preventing apoptosis, and blockade of the nuclear pore complex. In this chapter, I will attempt to cover the breadth of the innate immune response to viral infection, but will also devote more space to generally under-considered aspects than to the well-known components. There are some caveats to consider, as most experiments have been performed in the murine model and not in man; further, conclusions from experiments using in vitro cultured cells (whether primary or established lines) may not reflect physiological conditions in an undisturbed CNS. Lastly, we now appreciate the complexities imposed on hosts by polymorphisms in genes of critical pathways, leading to increased susceptibility or resistance of that individual but not others.","output":"Innate Immunity in Viral Encephalitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study was carried out with the aim of determining the correlation between the levels of anxiety experienced by students and their sleep quality during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The overall cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate is 130 per 100,000, with up to 50% mortality in critically ill patients. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collaborated with the Mayo Clinic to develop a national Expanded Access Program (EAP) for COVID convalescent plasma (CCP). In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when CCP was scarce, the MedStar Health system leveraged a large number of recovered patients enrolled in a donor protocol to ensure adequate CCP and meet the demand across the hospital network, including our community hospitals. AIM To work as a hospital system to enroll donors and obtain convalescent plasma across a hospital network of eight hospitals in the Maryland and Washington DC area, including our smaller community hospitals to ensure all patients with COVID -19 infection had access to this resource. Additionally, we worked to treat patients uniformly and track metrics to measure outcomes. METHODS Due to the unavailability of CCP at the beginning of the pandemic, a working group from MedStar Washington Hospital Center, the largest hospital in the healthcare system, designed a protocol to systematically screen and send eligible donors to our local blood collection centers. As each donor can donate two to three units of plasma, we were able to distribute CCP units obtained to all hospitals across our hospital network, which included our smaller community hospitals. The donor screening protocol was utilized from April 9, 2020, until June 1, 2020, when the CCP became more available from our local blood collector. Dedicated nurse practitioners screened all potential donors that called a dedicated donor line. At the beginning of the pandemic, we worked with our COVID clinic to screen potential donors for PCR negativity and obtain blood types; when deemed eligible, we sent them to AABB accredited local donation centers. All CCP units obtained were returned to our hospital network to be directed by the working group to in-system hospitals. Regular system-wide calls were utilized to monitor COVID admission rates and project demand in our health system. For the treatment arm, we included patients over 18 years old with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 enrolled between April 13, 2020, to June 1, 2020. As a healthcare system, we attempted to treat patients early in their disease course, especially within 14 days of symptoms. When resources were scarce, we aimed to treat patients that appeared to have tangentially worsening symptoms as judged by continued/increasing oxygen requirements and worsening inflammatory markers. RESULTS We screened 159 potential donors, and 143 (89.9%) were sent to our local blood collectors to provide between 2 and 4 units of CCP per donation. We started our screening protocol five days before our first CCP transfusion and were able to meet the demand for convalescent plasma until the American Red Cross (ARC) could provide enough CCP for our needs, end of May 2020. A total of 324 patients were enrolled in the Mayo Expanded Access Program, and 116 patients were excluded: 4 (3%) were transferred to outside hospitals, 27 (23%) died before CCP transfusion (when resources were scarce), 5 (4%) had more than 14 days of symptoms onset, 64 (55%) were discharged before CCP infusion, and 36 patients were waiting for plasma transfusion. 172 patients received convalescent plasma, including 12 patients (6.9%) that received two units of CCP. 114 (66%) discharged. The adjusted 28 day-mortality rate was 23%. CONCLUSION The MedStar Health System was able to leverage many potential donors to match the demand for CCP early in the pandemic and provide this scarce resource to the maximum number of patients treated in our network. By designing a donor protocol to obtain the ideal amount of CCP units, we were able to meet demand across a hospital system and treat patients at community hospitals in the network who may not have otherwise had access to this resource.

In COVID-19, pathogenic myeloid cell overactivation is found to be a vital mediator of damage to tissues, hypercoagulability, and the cytokine storm. These cytokines unselectively infiltrate various tissues, such as the lungs and heart, and nervous system. This cytokine storm can hence cause multi-organ dysfunction and life-threatening complications. Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that may be helpful in some cases with COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to determine whether different muscle adipose tissue depots are associated with mortality and muscle damage in patients affected by COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. Methods: CT images were obtained in 153 ICU patients with COVID-19 (121 males and 32 females). Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein, Creatine PhosphoKinase (CPK), muscle density, and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) were measured. Results: Participants in the highest tertile of IMAT/muscle had the shorter 28-day survival from ICU admission as compared to subjects in the first tertile. Estimates derived from the Cox proportional hazard models, after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, confirmed the results of the survival analysis (HR 3.94, 95% CI: 1.03-15.09). Participants in the lowest tertile of muscle density had the shorter survival at 28 days from ICU admission as compared to subjects in the highest tertile (HR 3.27, 95% CI: 1.18-4.61), but the relationship was no longer significant when age was included in the model. Subjects in the second muscle density tertile did not show an increased risk. Participants in the highest tertile of IMAT/muscle and those in the lowest tertile of muscle density showed both significantly higher CPK adjusted for weight values as evaluated during the first 8 days of hospitalization. Conclusion: Our data seem to suggest that higher levels of IMAT/muscle and low muscle density are both associated with higher risk of ICU mortality and muscle injury as evaluated with CPK level.","output":"Intermuscular Adipose Tissue as a Risk Factor for Mortality and Muscle Injury in Critically Ill Patients Affected by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi emerged amidst widespread anti-government demonstrations and subsequent mass gatherings. This paper describes the incidence and factors associated with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective study of public data analysing geopolitical and immigration activities that occurred between 02 April and 08 September 2020. The Chi-square test of independence was used to tabulate sex and age-related fatality ratios among deaths due to COVID-19-related complications. RESULTS: The drivers for COVID-19 spread were mass gatherings secondary to the country's political landscape and repatriation of citizens from high-risk areas coupled with minimum use of public health interventions. The prevalence was higher in people aged 50-59 years, males and in urban areas. Men had an increased risk of COVID-19-related deaths (Case Fatality Ratio: 1.58 (95% CI 1.11-2.22) compared with women. Furthermore, men and women aged &#8805;40 years were 16.1 times and 7.1 times more likely to die of COVID-related complications, respectively. Men aged &#8805;40 years had a 62% increased risk of deaths compared with women of the same age group. CONCLUSION: Mass political gatherings and cross-border immigration from high-risk areas were drivers for infection. Males, older age and urban residence were associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. To control the spread of COVID-19 there is a need to regulate mass gatherings and repatriation of citizens, and strengthen the use of preventive health interventions. Men, the older age groups and urban areas should be prioritised for COVID-19 prevention strategies.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi: Did public sociopolitical events gatherings contribute to its first-wave local transmission?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In the last few years, multiple new infectious diseases have affected amphibians, causing unprecedented declines and extinctions at the global scale. Many of these diseases are caused by pathogens that have been described during recent decades. In this study we report a novel disease, affecting European amphibians. In a protected area of Northern Italy, since the autumn of 2013, we started to find some adult salamanders with cysts at the throat level (subgular region). Following this observation, we ran a regular monitoring of the salamander population and performed multiple morphological and molecular investigations to identify the cause of this undescribed disease. The cysts surround peculiar cells, probably protists, of about 30 m covered by numerous motile cilia/undulipodia. Despite multiple attempts with a broad spectrum of techniques, the detailed identification remains challenging as we have been unable to match its features with previously described organisms. We provide the results achieved till now to promote a rapid dissemination on this new enigmatic wildlife pathogen and to create a basis for further and deeper studies. ABSTRACT: New pathologies are causing dramatic declines and extinctions of multiple amphibian species. In 2013, in one fire salamander population of Northern Italy, we found individuals with undescribed cysts at the throat level, a malady whose existence has not previously been reported in amphibians. With the aim of describing this novel disease, we performed repeated field surveys to assess the frequency of affected salamanders from 2014 to 2020, and integrated morphological, histological, and molecular analyses to identify the pathogen. The novel disease affected up to 22% of salamanders of the study population and started spreading to nearby populations. Cysts are formed by mucus surrounding protist-like cells about 30 m long, characterized by numerous cilia/undulipodia. Morphological and genetic analyses did not yield a clear match with described organisms. The existence of this pathogen calls for the implementation of biosecurity protocols and more studies on the dynamics of transmission and the impact on wild populations.","output":"A New Disease Caused by an Unidentified Etiological Agent Affects European Salamanders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human rhinovirus C (HRV-C) is a newly identified genotype of HRV found in patients with respiratory tract infections (RTIs); however, its epidemiological profile and clinical characteristics are not well understood. In this study, Chinese children with RTIs were screened for HRV-C and their epidemiological and clinical characteristics were analyzed. From December 2006 to November 2007, 406 nasopharyngeal aspirates from children younger than 14 years of age with RTIs were screened for HRV and other common respiratory viruses by PCR or reverse transcription-PCR. Two-hundred twenty-four (55.2%) of the specimens were infected with at least one virus, including 53 patients with HRV (13%). HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C were detected in 22, 12, and 19 specimens, respectively. HRV-C was detected mainly from December 2006 to April 2007 and from October to November 2007, with peaks in December and April (10/19). Acute upper respiratory infection and bronchopneumonia were observed in 53 and 37% of the cases, respectively. The most common symptoms were cough (82%), runny nose (53%), and fever (37%). Wheezing and bronchiolitis were less common in patients infected with HRV-C than in those infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Partial sequencing of the genes coding for VP4 and VP2 revealed that the HRV-C strains were 56 to 62% identical at the amino acid level to HRV-B and HRV-A reference strains and 80 to 99% identical to HRV-C reference strains. In conclusion, HRV-C is an important cause of RTIs in children, and highly diversified strains of HRV-C are prevalent in China.

In hyperacute liver failure, deterioration occurs in less than 14 days. Whilst it is a relatively uncommon reason for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), acute liver failure is important because it often occurs in previously well young adults and carries a high mortality. Management of these patients presents considerable challenges within the ICU due to the extreme nature of the associated pathophysiological processes, which affect multiple systems. Integrated management strategies have been poorly studied and treatment is often center-specific [1]. Clinical manifestations include a reduced conscious state, jaundice with abnormal liver function tests (especially elevations in amino acid transferase levels more than 25 times the upper limit of normal) and coagulopathy. Further deterioration can involve marked cerebral edema, hypoglycemia and severe shock with lactic acidosis and multiple organ failure. The use of clinical management guidelines may assist in the treatment of these patients by providing an evidence-based framework for care by staff at the bedside, which ensures that all important priorities are adequately addressed. It is possible that a coordinated combination of specific and general therapies may reduce mortality and the need for liver transplantation.

We carried out the first study to investigate the migration pattern and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV genome epidemiology in Chinese horseshoe bats during a 4-year period. Of 1,401 Chinese horseshoe bats from Hong Kong and Guangdong, China, that were sampled, SARSr-Rh-BatCoV was detected in alimentary specimens from 130 (9.3%) bats, with peak activity during spring. A tagging exercise of 511 bats showed migration distances from 1.86 to 17 km. Bats carrying SARSr-Rh-BatCoV appeared healthy, with viral clearance occurring between 2 weeks and 4 months. However, lower body weights were observed in bats positive for SARSr-Rh-BatCoV, but not Rh-BatCoV HKU2. Complete genome sequencing of 10 SARSr-Rh-BatCoV strains showed frequent recombination between different strains. Moreover, recombination was detected between SARSr-Rh-BatCoV Rp3 from Guangxi, China, and Rf1 from Hubei, China, in the possible generation of civet SARSr-CoV SZ3, with a breakpoint at the nsp16/spike region. Molecular clock analysis showed that SARSr-CoVs were newly emerged viruses with the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) at 1972, which diverged between civet and bat strains in 1995. The present data suggest that SARSr-Rh-BatCoV causes acute, self-limiting infection in horseshoe bats, which serve as a reservoir for recombination between strains from different geographical locations within reachable foraging range. Civet SARSr-CoV is likely a recombinant virus arising from SARSr-CoV strains closely related to SARSr-Rh-BatCoV Rp3 and Rf1. Such frequent recombination, coupled with rapid evolution especially in ORF7b/ORF8 region, in these animals may have accounted for the cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS.","output":"Ecoepidemiology and complete genome comparison of different strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus in China reveal bats as a reservoir for acute, self-limiting infection that allows recombination events."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spike and nucleocapsid are structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and major targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).

These peptides were coupled to the surface of liposomes, and inoculated into mice. Six liposomal peptides effectively induced IFN--producing CD8(+) T cells and seven liposomal peptides including the six peptides primed CTLs showing in vivo killing activities. Further, CTLs induced by the seven liposomal peptides lysed an HLA-A*0201 positive cell line expressing naturally processed, pp1a-derived peptides. Of note, one of the liposomal peptides induced high numbers of long-lasting memory CTLs.

We put forward three ethical reasons why, given the unprecedented circumstances, the change should have been postponed. We argue that (1) COVID-19 dominating headlines will prevent widespread awareness of the change, thereby undermining the autonomy of those who do not wish to be donors; (2) a lack of transplant activity during the pandemic will make the impact of the change difficult to measure; and (3) trust in the new system may be damaged given controversial decisions regarding Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation orders and the allocation of scarce intensive care resources.

Data was collected through two online questionnaires and semi-direct individual interviews with service users, families, and caregivers. RESULTS: The responses to our questionnaires from 173 family members, 68 service users and 40 caregivers show that people suffering from mental disorders adapted well to the confinement.

After gathering consensus for the operating classification scheme, the clinicians were instructed to use the scheme to assess tongue features of their patients under direct visual inspection. At the same time, the clinicians took tongue images of the patients with smartphones and assessed tongue features observed in the smartphone image using the same classification scheme. The intra-rater agreements of these two assessments were calculated to determine which features of tongue coating were better retained by the image. Using the finalized operating classification scheme, clinicians in the study group assessed representative tongue images (n=24) that they had taken, and the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of their assessments was evaluated. RESULTS: Intra-rater agreement between direct subject inspection and tongue image inspection was good to very good (Cohen  range 0.69-1.0). Additionally, when comparing the assessment of tongue images on different days, intra-rater reliability was good to very good ( range 0.7-1.0), except for the color of the tongue body (=0.22) and slippery tongue fur (=0.1). Inter-rater reliability was moderate for tongue coating (Gwet AC2 range 0.49-0.55), and fair for color and other features of the tongue body (Gwet AC2=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study has shown that tongue images collected via smartphone contain some reliable features, including tongue coating, that can be used in mHealth analysis. Our findings thus support the use of smartphones in telemedicine for detecting changes in tongue coating.","output":"Intra-Rater and Inter-Rater Reliability of Tongue Coating Diagnosis in Traditional Chinese Medicine Using Smartphones: Quasi-Delphi Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The American Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) guidelines for scholarly activities by family medicine residents require at least one activity per resident and encourage conference presentations. Meeting these guidelines has traditionally been challenging due to a multitude of factors from lack of time to limited administrative support. Studies have shown that resident participation in research was associated with higher levels of satisfaction with training. We aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a dedicated research curriculum in achieving ACGME goals for our residents. METHODS We performed a need assessment that identified strengths and obstacles related to research which then guided the actions taken to build the curriculum. Revised curricular elements included a research focused lecture series, a restructured journal club, financial support for presentations and project expenses, a specific timeline for project completion, and the development of a regional research day involving multiple family medicine programs. Dedicated research time was built into the resident schedule and presentations at local, regional and national conferences were encouraged and supported. RESULTS Following implementation of the curriculum there was a marked increase in the number of scholarly projects performed by residents. Prior to implementation there had only been one presentation at a national conference in the previous five years. This increased to an average of four presentations per year in the following five year period. On a regional scale, the initial success of the local research day led to a continued expansion and now includes six family medicine programs. CONCLUSION Implementation of a dedicated multifaceted research curriculum significantly increased the participation of our residents in scholarly activities and led to a near five-fold increase in presentations at regional and national levels. Additionally, resident satisfaction in scholarly activities increased and a far greater number of graduating residents went on to complete fellowships.","output":"Cultivating change: Engaging residents in research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a new method for the random sampling of connected graphs with a specified degree sequence.

A recent scoping review by the authors found that both depression and anxiety frequently featured in the accounts of those living with the illness. However, less clear were the factors that led to such psychological distress, the impact that the illness had on families and how to best support those living or supporting someone living with the illness. In light of this, the aim of this study was to explore how the illness impacted the lives of both those diagnosed with the illness and those supporting them. METHOD AND RESULTS This study adopted a phenomenological approach to understand the subjective experiences of individual participants. A total of 30 individuals took part in Asynchronous Virtual Focus Groups hosted on a Virtual Learning Environment for a four-week period. Chronological narratives of individuals' lived experiences from diagnosis to post-transplant are presented below. These narratives centred upon individuals' and families' experiences of receiving a diagnosis, and adjusting to life post-diagnosis, particularly in regard to their relationships with health professionals and other family members, and in preparing for the possibility of transplant.

The performance assessment of an integrated PET/MR scanner with these positron emitters is required for related applications, as the magnetic field interferes with the positron propagation. Such an assessment is to be performed on the United Imaging uPMR 790 integrated PET/MR system. METHODS: The performance measurement methods were modified based on NEMA NU 2-2012, involving 18 F, 64 Cu, 68 Ga, 89 Zr, and 124 I as positron emitters. The NEMA IEC phantom was used for evaluations of image qualities. An agarose cap was wrapped around the point source for tissue-simulating spatial resolution measurement. The count rate performance was assessed with selected positron emitters. Images of a 3D-printed Derenzo phantom and representative patients were also acquired. RESULTS: The image quality measurement showed that all five positron emitters were suitable for the PET/MR system studied. However, due to the magnetic field, the image of the point source showed an elongated comet-tail feature, which could be eliminated by a tissue-simulating cap. This effect is more obvious in 124 I and 68 Ga, due to their long positron ranges. The imaging ability with various positron emitters was further validated with the count rate assessment, the Derenzo phantom, and the clinical images. CONCLUSIONS: Different positron emitters could be effectively imaged by the PET/MR system tested. The resolution measurement strategy proposed could be applied to measure PET spatial resolution in the magnetic field. This article is protected by copyright.

Yet, the underlying mechanisms for such associations are largely unknown. This study aims to examine potential serial multiple mediation effects of problematic smartphone use (PSU) and psychological distress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms) in the relationship between sleep quality and disordered eating behaviors/attitudes (DEBs). Methods: A total of 4,325 students from two Tibet universities in China (2,657 females and 1,668 males) completed an online survey that included the following measurements: Eating Attitude Test-26 for disordered eating behaviors/attitudes, the Chinese Version of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI), Smartphone Addiction ScaleShort Version (SAS-SV) for problematic smartphone use, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for psychological distress. Results: While the direct path linking sleep quality and DEBs was not found to be significant (Standardized  = 0.006, 95% CI = ?0.0667~0.0970), both PSU (Standardized  = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.0256~0.0591) and anxiety symptoms (Standardized  = 0.014, 95% CI = 0.0203~0.0526) may mediate a link between sleep quality and DEBs; serial multiple mediation analysis revealed that a serial indirect pathway of sleep quality -> PSU -> anxiety symptoms -> DEBs existed(Standardized  = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.0002~0.0012). Similarly, while the direct path linking sleep quality and DEBs was not found to be significant (Standardized  = 0.006, 95% CI = ?0.0667~0.0970), both PSU (Standardized  = 0.020, 95% CI = 0.0337~0.0692) and depressive symptoms (Standardized  = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.0139~0.0652) may mediate a link between sleep quality and DEBs; serial multiple mediation analysis revealed that a serial indirect pathway of sleep quality -> PSU -> depressive symptoms -> DEBs existed (Standardized  = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.0006~0.0038). Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral factors may comprehensively work together, leading to flow-on effects from sleep problems to disordered eating behaviors among university students. Appropriate interventions that target problematic smartphone use could thus potentially reduce anxiety and depression levels, which in turn will provide a buffer against the negative impact of poor sleep quality on eating disorder symptoms.","output":"The Role of Problematic Smartphone Uses and Psychological Distress in the Relationship Between Sleep Quality and Disordered Eating Behaviors Among Chinese College Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This timely special issue on political development broadens the empirical conversation around how adolescents are engaging politically and civically, what factors shape their involvement, how their involvement impacts their wellbeing, and how to engage diverse populations of youth in the political system.

However, data are lacking for inhaled zanamivir on its effectiveness to prevent hospitalization and death. METHODS: This nationwide, population-based cohort study included all outpatients treated with inhaled zanamivir or oral oseltamivir, within 48 hours after a clinical diagnosis of influenza, before and after the rollout of inhaled zanamivir as the first-line antiviral in Taiwan. The main outcome is influenza-related hospitalization or death within 14 days, ascertained using Taiwan national health insurance database and national death registry, respectively. Those developed the outcome within 2 days were excluded from analyses. Propensity score stratification was used to control confounding from covariates. RESULTS: A total of 865,032 eligible influenza outpatients were included in the analysis. The risk of developing the main outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96 to 1.06) did not differ between inhaled zanamivir group (n = 595,897, 68.9%, the reference) and oral oseltamivir group (n = 269,135, 31.1%).

While measuring care processes does offer the potential to improve care quality, the choice of which mental health nursing metrics to measure presents a significant challenge, both in Ireland and internationally. The provision of safe and high-quality mental health nursing care stems from nurses' expertise, skills and overall capacity to provide recovery focused care across a range of health care settings. Accordingly, efforts to measure what mental health nurses do depends on the identification of those care processes that contribute to mental health nursing practice. This paper reports on the identification, development and prioritisation of a national suite of Quality Care Metrics (QCM), along with their associated indicators, for mental health nursing care processes in Ireland. METHODS The study was undertaken over four phases; i) a systematic literature review to identify mental health care process metrics and their associated indicators of measurement; ii) a two-round, online Delphi survey of mental health nurses to develop consensus on the suit of mental health nursing care process metrics; iii) a two-round online Delphi survey of mental health nurses to develop consensus on the indicators to be used to measure the agreed metrics; and iv) a face-to-face consensus meeting with mental health nurses and service user representatives to develop consensus on the final suite of metrics and indicators. RESULTS Following these four phases 9 metrics and their 71 associated indicators were agreed for inclusion in the final suite of Mental Health Nursing QCM. These metrics are applicable across the life span and the range of mental health nursing health care settings. CONCLUSION The development of this suite of Mental Health Nursing QCM and their indicators represents an opportunity for the measurement of safe and high-quality mental health nursing care for application in Ireland and internationally. This initial development of metrics and indicators should be followed by a rigorous baseline review of QCM uptake and implementation amongst mental health nurses as part of an ongoing evaluation.","output":"Collaborative identification and prioritisation of mental health nursing care process metrics and indicators: a Delphi consensus study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, disproportionally affecting vulnerable people and deepening pre-existing inequalities (Dreze, 2020;Qureshi, 2021), have interested the very same \\"development\\" processes that the IFIP Working Group 9.4 on the Implications of Information and Digital Technologies for Development has dealt with over time.

METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with at least two chest CTs and mean 3-month interval between the initial and follow-up CT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were categorized into two groups: complete resolution and residual disease on follow-up CT. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data as well as initial and follow-up chest CT scans were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty patients (57.7%) demonstrate complete resolution of pulmonary findings, and 22 patients (42.3%) had residual disease on follow-up CT. The mean time interval between initial and follow-up CT was 91.3  17.2 and 90.6  14.3 days in the complete resolution and residual groups, respectively. The most common radiologic pattern in residual disease was ground-glass opacities (54.5%), followed by mixed ground-glass and subpleural parenchymal bands (31.8%), and pure parenchymal bands (13.7%). Compared to complete resolution group, patients with residual disease had higher CT severity score on initial exam (10.3  5.4 vs. 7.3  4.6, P value = 0.036), longer duration of hospitalization, higher rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, more underlying medical conditions, higher initial WBC count, and higher occurrence rate of leukocytosis in the hospitalization time period (all P values < 0.05).

We found that CRP, LDH, HBDH, CD4/CD8 and IgE levels were increased in 6/9 patients, while PA and the absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes decreased in 7/9 patients.

The generated surveillance sequencing data (n = 320 SARS-CoV-2 genomes) showed that the development of the local viral population structure from August to December 2020 was consistent with European trends, with the notable absence of SARS-CoV-2 variants 20I/501Y.V1/B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 until the end of the local sampling period. Against a background of local surveillance and other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 data, four putative SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at Dusseldorf University Hospital between October and December 2020 (n = 44 viral genomes) were investigated and confirmed as clonal, contributing to the development of improved infection control and prevention measures. An analysis of the generated surveillance sequencing data with respect to infection clusters in the population based on a greedy clustering algorithm identified five candidate clusters, all of which were subsequently confirmed by the integration of public health authority contact tracing data and shown to be represent transmission settings of particular relevance (schools, care homes). A joint analysis of outbreak and surveillance data identified a potential transmission of an outbreak strain from the local population into the hospital and back; and an in-depth analysis of one population infection cluster combining genetic with contact tracing data enabled the identification of a previously unrecognized population transmission chain involving a martial arts gym.

Our objective was to assess the current early complication rate associated with biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) since the introduction of a laparoscopic approach in our institution, a university-affiliated tertiary care center. METHODS A consecutive series of 1000 patients who had undergone BPD-DS from November 2006 to January 2010 was surveyed. The primary endpoint was the mortality rate. The secondary endpoints were the major 30-day complication rate and hospital stay >10 days. The data are reported as a mean  SD, comparing the laparoscopic (n = 228) and open (n = 772) groups. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 43  10 years (40  10 years in the laparoscopy group versus 44  10 years in the open group, P < .01). The preoperative body mass index was 51  8 kg/m(2) (47  7 laparoscopy versus 52  8 kg/m(2) open, P < .01). The conversion rate in the laparoscopy group was 2.6%. There was 1 postoperative death (.1%) from a pulmonary embolism in the laparoscopy group. The mean hospital stay was shorter after laparoscopic surgery (6  6 d versus 7  9 d, P = .01), and a hospital stay >10 days was more frequent in the open group (4.4% versus 7%, P = .04). Major complications occurred in 7% of the patients, with no significant differences between the 2 groups (7% versus 7.4%, P = .1). No differences were found in the overall leak or intra-abdominal abscess rate (3.5% versus 4%, P = .1); however, gastric leaks were more frequent after open surgery (0% versus 2%, P = .02).

It binds to amino groups on the surface of bacteria, imparts magnetism to them, and orients them in response to magnetic fields. SNCNCs kill and capture bacteria to avoid inflammation, infection, and organ damage caused by lipopolysaccharide and exotoxin released by bacterial rupture in the remaining bacterial remains in comparison with other antibacterial agents. In this study, in the treatment of traumatic oral ulcers, we found that SNCNCs could kill and capture and remove bacteria from the ulcers to reduce inflammation at the site of the wound. Furthermore, the fibrin gel sprayed on the ulcer was used as a substrate, and the bacteria captured by the SNCNCs moved to the surface of the fibrin gel after a magnetic field was applied. Therefore, the bacteria in the ulcer could be removed with the SNCNCs and fibrin gel magnet, alleviating inflammation caused by bacteria and promoting ulcer healing.

These VOC have rapidly spread through multiple geographies being enabled by high transmission rates and/or high viral load compared to the original parent strain. Consequently, the altered phenotypes of these VOC have posed greater challenges to diagnostic and clinical management of COVID-19. Despite considerable progress being made on vaccine roll out, practicing proper hand hygiene has been advocated as a consistent precautionary intervention as more virulent VOC continue to emerge and spread across geographies. Two variants of concern, namely beta and delta, have recently been shown to escape antibody-mediated neutralization by virtue of acquired mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein which binds to the human ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. In this report we have empirically determined the efficacy of a range of personal care formulations in inactivating the beta and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. High titres of these variants were exposed to marketed personal care formulations from Unilever under standard in-vitro suspension test-based conditions relevant to end-user habits. All the formulations demonstrated greater than 99.9% reduction in viral infective titres. The rate of inactivation by these products were comparable to that of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus tested under the same conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that well-designed personal care formulations when tested under consumer-centric conditions, and with proven efficacy against the parent strain of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be effective against extant and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. This is through their broad-spectrum mode of action (disruption of lipid bilayer of the host-derived viral envelope, denaturation of envelop and nucleocapsid proteins, and disruption of genome) which is independent of the escape mutations that facilitate immune evasion or enhanced transmissibility.","output":"Personal care formulations demonstrate virucidal efficacy against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: implications for hand hygiene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we analyze how pregnant and breastfeeding women perceive the inside of their bodies as well as their thoughts regarding the accumulation and elimination of chemical compounds present in food, and how these are then transmitted to the fetus.

This paper outlines modifications made to Omran's original model and stages of transition, and suggests that without a focus on aetiology and morbidity, these have been basically descriptive rather than explanatory, and potentially misleading because infections have been confirmed as causes of various chronic diseases. Common infections and related immune responses or inflammatory processes contribute to the multifactorial aetiology of morbid conditions that together make a substantial contribution to overall mortality, and infectious causation is suspected for many others because of strong evidence of association. Investigation into possible infectious causes of conditions frequently recorded as the underlying cause of death can be integrated into a framework for comparative research on patterns of disease and mortality in support of public health and prevention.

RESULTS: In SG, muscle pain was more common and it was characterized by a high level of intensity. Muscle weakness occurred more frequently in the SG and it was more frequent compared to CG. The CK parameter was observed to be higher in the SG compared to the CG and was often associated with the severity of muscle pain in the range of moderate to severe.

No farmer reported relying solely on intermediated markets (e.g., restaurants, grocery stores, institutions). Distribution channels that incorporated an online marketplace offering prepacked pre-orders were a notable strength of highly adaptive Maryland produce farmers. Farmers reported that expanding established CSAs was an important method for reallocating produce originally intended to be sold to reduced/terminated marketing channels. Common challenges among farmers included increased administrative workload, concerns associated with raising food prices during a crisis, and environmental concerns about the use of additional packaging. We describe a range of adaptive behaviors that aided farmers in withstanding shocks.","output":"An examination of adaptations of direct marketing channels and practices by Maryland fruit and vegetable farmers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation measures put in place have resulted in universal disruption in the usual ways of life for individuals. The current study sought to investigate how aspects of sexual health (well-being and functioning) and relationship satisfaction changed or remained stable during the pandemic. During two separate time points (Time 1 including Time 1 and a retrospective baseline, Time 2), participants completed online measures of sexual well-being (sexual pleasure, partnered and solitary orgasm frequency, sexual distress), sexual functioning, and relationship satisfaction. Participants reported slight declines in sexual pleasure, frequency of orgasms with a partner, and frequency of solitary orgasms from pre-COVID-19 (retrospective baseline) to Time 1, with no significant differences in sexual distress and relationship satisfaction. For individuals with vulvas, sexual functioning improved from Time 1 to Time 2, whereas no significant differences in sexual functioning were observed for individuals with penises. Aspects of sexual health and relational satisfaction did not sufficiently change across time points to be considered meaningful health outcome changes. Given that minimal disruptions were noted in pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 sexuality, these results highlight the potential resiliency of individuals sexuality when facing sudden changes in their daily lives.

Yet the potential impact of suspending elective surgery on ICU bed capacity is unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 5 years of New York State data on ICU usage. Descriptions of ICU utilization and mechanical ventilation were stratified by admission type (elective surgery, emergent/urgent/trauma surgery, and medical admissions) and by geographic location (New York metropolitan region versus the rest of New York State). Data are presented as absolute numbers and percentages and all adult and pediatric ICU patients were included. RESULTS Overall, ICU admissions in New York State were seen in 10.1% of all hospitalizations (n = 1,232,986/n = 12,251,617) and remained stable over a 5-year period from 2011 to 2015. Among n = 1,232,986 ICU stays, sources of ICU admission included elective surgery (13.4%, n = 165,365), emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery (28.0%, n = 345,094), and medical admissions (58.6%, n = 722,527). Ventilator utilization was seen in 26.3% (n = 323,789/n = 1232,986) of all ICU patients of which 6.4% (n = 20,652), 32.8% (n = 106,186), and 60.8% (n = 196,951) was for patients from elective, emergent, and medical admissions, respectively. New York City holds the majority of ICU bed capacity (70.0%; n = 2496/n = 3566) in New York State. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing elective surgery comprised a small fraction of ICU bed and mechanical ventilation use in New York State. Suspension of elective surgeries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may thus have a minor impact on ICU capacity when compared to other sources of ICU admission such as emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery and medical admissions.

We aimed to conduct a multidimensional analysis of risk factors associated with the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. METHODS: In this retrospective study involving 1443 patients with COVID-19, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory characteristics and risk factors associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19 with and without diabetes. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. The 84-day survival duration for critical patients with COVID-19 and diabetes who had different levels of leukocytes and neutrophils, or treated with immunoglobulin or not, was conducted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. RESULTS: Of the 1443 patients with COVID-19, 256 (17.7%) had diabetes, had a median age of 66.0 [IQR 58.0-73.8] years, and were more likely to develop severe (41.8% vs. 35.6%) and critical disease (34.0% vs. 14.9%), followed by higher mortality (21.1% vs. 7.0%), than those without diabetes. Higher levels of leukocytes (> 5.37  109/L), older age, and comorbid cerebrovascular disease and chronic renal disease independently contributed to in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. Leukocytes > 5.37  109/L and the application of immunoglobulin were associated with shorter survival duration and lower mortality, respectively, in critical patients with COVID-19 and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to patients with COVID-19 and diabetes, especially when they have high leukocyte counts (> 5.37  109/L).

ER-stress induction of GRP78 in cancer cells represents a major pro-survival branch of the UPR. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a highly lethal disease and high level of GRP78 is associated with aggressive disease and poor survival. Recently, we reported that PDAC exhibited high level of ER stress and that GRP78 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to suppress pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice, suggesting the utility of inhibitors of GRP78 expression in combating pancreatic cancer. Screening of clinically relevant compound libraries revealed that cardiac glycosides (CGs) can inhibit ER-stress induction of GRP78 in pancreatic and other types of human cancers. Using the FDA-approved CG compound Lanatoside C (LanC) and human pancreatic cancer cell lines as model systems, we discovered that LanC preferably suppressed ER stress induction of GRP78 and to a lesser extent GRP94. The suppression is at the post-transcriptional level and dependent on the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase ion pump. Overexpression of GRP78 mitigates apoptotic activities of LanC in ER stressed cells. Our study revealed a new function of CGs as inhibitor of stress induction of GRP78, and that this suppression at least in part contributes to the apoptotic activities of CGs in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. These findings support further investigation into CGs as potential antineoplastic agents for pancreatic and other cancers which depend on GRP78 for growth and survival.","output":"Suppression of ER-stress induction of GRP78 as an anti-neoplastic mechanism of the cardiac glycoside Lanatoside C in pancreatic cancer: Lanatoside C suppresses GRP78 stress induction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first Therapeutic ROS and Immunity in Cancer (TRIC) meeting was organized by the excellence research center ZIK plasmatis (with its previous Frontiers in Redox Biochemistry and Medicine (FiRBaM) and Young Professionals Workshop in Plasma Medicine (YPWPM) workshop series in Northern Germany) and the excellence research program ONKOTHER-H (Rostock/Greifswald, Germany).

Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibodies that can inhibit virus-ACE2 interaction to prevent viral entry.

This survey examines the levels of knowledge and the perception of risk within the population and analyses implementation and adherence to the recommended and legally mandated safety measures in the early phase of the COVID-19-pandemic. Methods In March 2020, participants registered on the HeReCa-Online-Panel from Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin and Schleswig Holstein were invited to complete a 65 question survey. Results 1 048 respondents answered the questionnaire, which amounts to a response of 3.5%. 83% of respondents stated that they felt themselves to be well-informed or very well-informed concerning COVID-19 and the coronavirus. The majority of respondents reported fears for the well-being of family members (60%) or the health of the German population as a whole (45%); 79% reported concerns regarding adverse economic impacts. 79% of respondents have implemented individual protective measures, such as reducing social contacts and maintaining the recommended physical distance in public spaces. Most respondents regarded the government mandated safety measures as predominantly reasonable and appropriate. Conclusions In the early phase of the pandemic, most people informed themselves of COVID-19 and started to take individual measures for risk reduction.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess real-time public awareness and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 epidemic across 12 selected countries. METHODS: Internet surveillance was used to collect real-time data from the general public to assess public awareness and rumors (China: Baidu; worldwide: Google Trends) and behavior responses (China: Ali Index; worldwide: Google Shopping). These indices measured the daily number of searches or purchases and were compared with the numbers of daily COVID-19 cases. The trend comparisons across selected countries were observed from December 1, 2019 (prepandemic baseline) to April 11, 2020 (at least one month after the governments of selected countries took actions for the pandemic). RESULTS: We identified missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control in 12 countries, when public awareness was very low despite the emerging epidemic. China's epidemic and the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern did not prompt a worldwide public reaction to adopt health-protective measures; instead, most countries and regions only responded to the epidemic after their own case counts increased. Rumors and misinformation led to a surge of sales in herbal remedies in China and antimalarial drugs worldwide, and timely clarification of rumors mitigated the rush to purchase unproven remedies. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative study highlights the urgent need for international coordination to promote mutual learning about epidemic characteristics and effective control measures as well as to trigger early and timely responses in individual countries. Early release of official guidelines and timely clarification of rumors led by governments are necessary to guide the public to take rational action.","output":"Cross-Country Comparison of Public Awareness, Rumors, and Behavioral Responses to the COVID-19 Epidemic: Infodemiology Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The methodology of Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) has been validated in both human and animal models. Herein is a discussion of our experience gained from the initial 130 patients enrolled in transgastric pre-NOTES and NOTES protocols at our institution. METHODS A retrospective review of our research database was performed for all patients enrolled in NOTES protocols. The infectious risk of a gastrotomy with and without a NOTES procedure was assessed in 100 patients. Eighty patients completed a true NOTES protocol looking at staging, access, and insufflation with select patients evaluating the potential for bacterial contamination of the abdominal compartment. RESULTS A total of 130 patients have completed pre-NOTES and NOTES protocols at our institution. We observed no clinically significant contamination of the abdomen secondary to transgastric procedures in 100 patients. Diagnostic transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy (DTEP) was completed in 20 patients with pancreatic head masses and found to have a 95% concordance with laparoscopic exploration for assessment of peritoneal metastases. Blind endoscopic gastrotomy and DTEP were evaluated in 40 patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures (LSRYGB) and were found to be safe, reliable, and without a clinically significant risk of contamination. Endoscopic peritoneal insufflation was successfully established and correlated with standard laparoscopic insufflation in 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS Transgastric NOTES is a safe alternative approach to accessing the peritoneal cavity in humans. The risk of bacterial contamination secondary to peroral and transgastric access is clinically insignificant.

Lipids play roles in energy metabolism, intracellular and extracellular signal traffic, and transport of fat-soluble vitamins. Also, they form the structure of the cell membrane. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with lipids since its genetic material contains lipid-enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA). Previous studies have shown that total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels are lower in patients with severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared to patients with non-severe COVID-19. Na(+)/H(+) Exchanger (NHE) is an important antiport that keeps the intracellular pH value within physiological limits. When the intracellular pH falls, NHE is activated and pumps H(+) ions outward. However, prolonged NHE activation causes cell damage and atherosclerosis. Prolonged NHE activation may increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19. In COVID-19, increased angiotensin II (Ang II) due to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) dysfunction stimulates NHE. Lipids are in close association with the NHE pump. Prolonged NHE activity increases the influx of H(+) ions and free fatty acid (FFA) inward. Ang II also causes increased low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) levels by inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Thus, intracellular atheroma plaque formation is accelerated. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 may replicate more rapidly as intracellular cholesterol increases. SARS-CoV-2 swiftly infects the cell whose intracellular pH decreases with NHE activation and FFA movement. Novel treatment regimens based on NHE and lipids should be explored for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Strong relationship between cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein receptor, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, and SARS-COV-2: this association may be the cause of death in the patient with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is on the rampage claiming over 297000 lives globally.

Some individuals are affected psychologically more severely and will need additional care. However, the current health system is so fragmented and focused on caring for those infected that management of mental illness has been neglected. An integrated approach is needed to strengthen the health system, service providers and research to not only manage the current mental health problems related to COVID but develop robust strategies to overcome more long-term impact of the pandemic. A series of recommendations are outlined in this paper to help policy makers, service providers and other stakeholders, and research and research funders to strengthen existing mental health systems, develop new ones, and at the same time advance research to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID19. The recommendations refer to low, middle and high resource settings as capabilities vary greatly between countries and within countries. DISCUSSION: The recommendations for policy makers are focused on strengthening leadership and governance, finance mechanisms, and developing programme and policies that especially include the most vulnerable populations. Service provision should focus on accessible and equitable evidence-based community care models commensurate with the existing mental health capacity to deliver care, train existing primary care staff to cater to increased mental health needs, implement prevention and promotion programmes tailored to local needs, and support civil societies and employers to address the increased burden of mental illness. Researchers and research funders should focus on research to develop robust information systems that can be enhanced further by linking with other data sources to run predictive models using artificial intelligence, understand neurobiological mechanisms and community-based interventions to address the pandemic driven mental health problems in an integrated manner and use innovative digital solutions.

However, it remains unclear if the disparity in mortality is due to gender differences in high-risk characteristics. Objective To study the clinical characteristics of a large and diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients stratified by gender and determine the outcomes after matching for age and other high-risk characteristics. Design Retrospective cohort between January 20, 2020, and April 15, 2020 Setting TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network consisting of multiple healthcare organizations (HCOs) predominantly in the United States Participants and Exposure A cohort of male and female patients > 10 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19 identified with real-time analyses of electronic medical records of patients from participating HCOs. A 1:1 propensity score matching of cohorts was performed for age, race, nicotine use, and all possible confounding comorbidities. Main Outcome Risk of mortality, hospitalization and mechanical ventilation within 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 Results A total of 5980 males and 7730 females diagnosed with COVID-19 were identified. Males were significantly older than females (54.9 (18.3) vs. 50.9 (18.4), p-value <0.0001). There were significant differences in patient characteristics, but after propensity matching, both groups (N=5350 each group) were balanced. Males had a significantly higher risk for mortality both before (Risk Ratio (RR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.4) and after matching (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7). Similarly, the risk of hospitalization (RR 1.3, 95%CI 1.2-1.4) and mechanical ventilation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) was significantly higher in males even after matching. On subanalysis, males age > 50 had higher mortality than matched females of similar age (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8), whereas the risk of mortality in matched groups < 40 years was similar (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.4-2.4). Conclusion In conclusion, males are more severely affected and have higher mortality from COVID-19. This gender-specific risk is especially more pronounced in advanced age. Gender disparity in poor outcomes can only be partially explained by differences in high-risk behavior and comorbidities.

The data were gathered in April?September 2020 through a survey (CAWI) among citizens of Poznan, Poland (n=502), and Kutaisi, Georgia (n=504), and were analyzed with structural equation modeling. The findings show that the intensity of digital communication tools usage for participation in the city branding and the perceived usefulness of social media contribute to the lasting relationships between citizens and local authorities in both countries. The novelty of this research concerns comparing two countries with different levels of development. Georgia is a developing economy in Europe and is in the process of modernizing the local governance across the cities. Poland, however, is a mature economy with a post-transformation heritage, where its cities benefit from considerable experience in building and developing citizen participation policies. Furthermore, the research was conducted amid the COVID-19 pandemic and evidenced the growing popularity of digital tools adoption by citizens in city matters. This study contributes to understanding the impact of digital tools on the relationship between citizens and local authorities in terms of city brand management. Citizens' participation in the city branding process via various digital communication tools increased citizen commitment towards long-lasting collaboration with local authorities. Moreover, citizens' perception of social media usefulness positively influences their desire to engage in the city branding process online, supporting the trust-building and collaboration between citizens and local authorities. Points for practitioners The intensiveness of digital tools usage ? governments should identify the tools already trusted and popular among their audience and employ those tools to a greater extent to maximize the chances of feedback, high citizen participation, and commitment.Citizens? perception of social media ? such characteristics as ease of use, transparency, ease of communication with the municipality, and safety encourage citizens to get involved in the city brand management process.

This paper analyzes patient online reviews (PORs) to identify emerging and fading topics and sentiment trends in PRWs during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Text data were collected, including 55,612 PORs of 3430 doctors from three popular PRWs in the United States (RateMDs, HealthGrades, and Vitals) from March 01 to June 27, 2020. An improved latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling (topic coherence-based LDA [TCLDA]), manual annotation, and sentiment analysis tool were applied to extract a suitable number of topics, generate corresponding keywords, assign topic names, and determine trends in the extracted topics and specific emotions. RESULTS: According to the coherence value and manual annotation, the identified taxonomy includes 30 topics across high-rank and low-rank disease categories. The emerging topics in PRWs focus mainly on themes such as treatment experience, policy implementation regarding epidemic control measures, individuals' attitudes toward the pandemic, and mental health across high-rank diseases. In contrast, the treatment process and experience during COVID-19, awareness and COVID-19 control measures, and COVID-19 deaths, fear, and stress were the most popular themes for low-rank diseases. Panic buying and daily life impact, treatment processes, and bedside manner were the fading themes across high-rank diseases. In contrast, provider attitude toward patients during the pandemic, detection at public transportation, passenger, travel bans and warnings, and materials supplies and society support during COVID-19 were the most fading themes across low-rank diseases. Regarding sentiment analysis, negative emotions (fear, anger, and sadness) prevail during the early wave of the COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Mining topic dynamics and sentiment trends in PRWs may provide valuable knowledge of patients' opinions during the COVID-19 crisis. Policymakers should consider these PORs and develop global healthcare policies and surveillance systems through monitoring PRWs. The findings of this study identify research gaps in the areas of e-health and text mining and offer future research directions.","output":"Mining topic and sentiment dynamics in physician rating websites during the early wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: Machine learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Backgrounds and Aims: The Northern Ireland Youth Wellbeing Survey (NIYWS) was commissioned by the Health and Social Care Board (NI) with the aim of providing reliable prevalence estimates of the mental health problems of children and young people aged 2-19 years.

However, how neural systems compute anticipatory utility remains unclear. We analyzed the brain activity of human participants as they performed a task involving choosing whether to receive information predictive of future pleasant outcomes. Using a computational model, we show three brain regions orchestrate anticipatory utility. Specifically, ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracks the value of anticipatory utility, dopaminergic midbrain correlates with information that enhances anticipation, while sustained hippocampal activity mediates a functional coupling between these regions. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified neural underpinning for anticipation's influence over decision-making and unify a range of phenomena associated with risk and time-delay preference.","output":"The value of what's to come: Neural mechanisms coupling prediction error and the utility of anticipation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We posit current infection control guidelines generally protect HCP from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare setting. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, we use viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCP at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States between 25 March - 27 December, 2020. We obtain limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combine epidemiological information with healthcare-associated viral sequences and with viral sequences collected in the broader community to infer the most likely source of infection in HCP. RESULTS: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 95 HCP and 137 possible patient contact sequences. The majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker (55/95; 57.9%) and were genetically similar to viruses circulating concurrently in the community. We found 10.5% of infections could be traced to a coworker (10/95). Strikingly, only 4.2% of HCP infections could be traced to a patient source (4/95). CONCLUSIONS: Infections among HCP add further strain to the healthcare system and put patients, HCP, and communities at risk. We found no evidence for healthcare-associated transmission in the majority of HCP infections evaluated here. Though we cannot rule out the possibility of cryptic healthcare-associated transmission, it appears that HCP most commonly becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2 via community exposure. This emphasizes the ongoing importance of mask-wearing, physical distancing, robust testing programs, and rapid distribution of vaccines.","output":"Viral sequencing reveals US healthcare personnel rarely become infected with SARS-CoV-2 through patient contact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To explore the relationship between sleep time, sleep quality, and emotional and cognitive function in the elderly. METHODS: A total of 150 elderly patients over 65 years old who were admitted to our hospital from February 2019 to April 2021 were divided into a normal cognitive function group (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score: illiteracy, >17; primary school, >20; and middle school and above, >24; N = 86) and cognitive impairment group (MMSE score: illiteracy, 17; primary school, 20; and middle school or above, 24; N = 64). The sleep quality was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and anxiety and depression were evaluated by Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), respectively. The cognitive function between the two groups was compared via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, visual spatial execution, and attention. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between sleep quality, sleep time, and emotional and cognitive function. RESULTS: In the comparison of sleep quality between the two groups, the total score of PSQI, sleep quality, falling asleep time, sleep time, and sleep efficiency of patients with cognitive impairment were higher than those of patients with normal cognitive function (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the scores of hypnotic use and daytime dysfunction between the two groups, but the scores of nocturnal sleep disorders and ESS in the cognitive impairment group were significantly higher than those in the normal group (P > 0.05). Compared between the two groups, the MoCA score, visual spatial execution, and attention in the cognitive impairment group were significantly lower than those in the normal group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The delayed recall in the cognitive impairment group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in orientation, naming, language, and abstract ability between the two groups (P > 0.05). The scores of HAMA and HAMD in the cognitive impairment group were significantly higher than those in the normal group. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between sleep therapy, sleep time, and the score of cognitive scale. The results showed that PSQI was negatively correlated with MoCA and MMSE, and ESS was negatively correlated with MoCA and MMSE. Pearson correlation analysis results indicated that PSQI was positively correlated with HAMA and HAMD, while ESS was negatively correlated with HAMA and HAMD. CONCLUSION: The sleep quality and sleep time of elderly patients are positively correlated with their cognitive function. The worse the sleep quality is, the worse their cognitive function is and the more serious their anxiety and depression are.

METHODS: The model was based on a V-Net architecture (IE-Vnet) and a multivariate (MR scans: T1, T2, FLAIR, SPACE) training dataset (D1, 179 consecutive patients with peripheral vestibulocochlear syndromes). Ground-truth TFS masks were generated in a semi-manual, atlas-assisted approach. IE-Vnet model segmentation performance, generalizability, and robustness to domain shift were evaluated on four heterogenous test datasets (D2-D5, n = 4  20 ears). RESULTS: The IE-Vnet model predicted TFS masks with consistently high congruence to the ground-truth in all test datasets (Dice overlap coefficient: 0.9  0.02, Hausdorff maximum surface distance: 0.93  0.71 mm, mean surface distance: 0.022  0.005 mm) without significant difference concerning side (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p>0.05), or dataset (Kruskal-Wallis test, p>0.05; post-hoc Mann-Whitney U, FDR-corrected, all p>0.2).

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in the Rheumatology Unit of Hospital Tuanku Jaa'far. All data entered through MyRA Touch App from April 2018 till April 2020 was analysed. Results: There were a total of 562 patients who entered the data in the App, 87.9% were women. The ethnic compositions of the study subjects comprised of Indians (36.7%) followed by the Malays (34.7%),Chinese (26.3%) and other ethnics (2.3%). About half of patients (59.8%) were in the 51-70 age group whereas 22.9%,1.8% and 15.5% were in the 31-50,18-30 and above 70 age groups respectively. The majority of our patients (96%) were literate. A total of 54.3% of them received secondary education, 27% primary, 12.2% tertiary and 6.6% did not receive any formal education. There was a high level of correlation between DAS28 ESR/CRP performed by patient and DAS28 ESR/CRP assessed by physician, (r=0.808 for DAS28 ESR and r=0.804 for DAS28 CRP). RAPID3 also showed high level of correlation with CDAI and DAS28 CRP assessed by patient (r=0.700 and r=0.718 respectively). There was a moderate correlation between DAS28 ESR/CRP done by physician with RAPID3 (r=0.656 and r=0.696 respectively).RAPID3 demonstrated little correlation with inflammatory markers ESR and CRP (r=0.141 and r=0.171 respectively). Conclusion: PROs via DAS 28 (ESR/CRP) and RAPID3 showed moderate to high correlation with disease activity assessed by physician. We can empower patients to perform their own disease assessment by using the MyRA Touch App before seeing their physician and the information provided in the App, can help to reduced consultation time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine is very much encouraged. By using the MyRA Touch, patients can assess their own tender and swollen joint count on a homunculus, evaluate their own physical function, health and pain using the RAPID3 parameters.

For this study, rHA of influenza virus B/Colorado/06/2017 was incorporated into synthetic virosomes, and adjuvant liposomes were formed with QS-21 from Saponaria quillaja, with or without the synthetic TLR4 agonist 3D - (6-acyl) PHAD. These components were concentrated and co-formulated into trehalose with dye. Dermal delivery was achieved using an economical 37-point stainless steel microneedle array, designed for automated fill/finish by microfluidic dispensers used for mass production of immunodiagnostics. Vaccine and adjuvant are deposited to form a sugar glass in a pocket on the side of each of the tips, allowing skin penetration to be performed directly by the rigid steel structure. In this study, Sprague Dawley rats (n = 6 per group) were vaccinated by VaxiPatches containing 0.3 g of rHA, 0.5 g QS-21 and 0.2 g 3D - (6-acyl) PHAD and dye, resulting in antigen-specific IgG titers 100-fold higher than 4.5 g of FluBlok (p = 0.001) delivered intramuscularly. Similarly, hemagglutination inhibition titers in these animals were 14-fold higher than FluBlok controls (p = 0.01).

Case report We present the case of a 46-year-old Caucasian male patient hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the Academic Emergency Hospital Sibiu, Romania with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from nasopharyngeal swabs, that during the disease course developed persistent hiccup associated with the administration of cortisone therapy, dexamethasone. A decision to stop the treatment with cortisone preparations was made, with the disappearance of the hiccup after 36 hours. Conclusions From our experience, other cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection that we managed during these months of the pandemic, with mild or severe forms of the disease, showed hiccup under treatment with dexamethasone, an event also described in other medical conditions under the same treatment and improved at its cessation or when replaced by methylprednisolone.","output":"Association of hiccup and SARS-CoV-2 infection with the administration of dexamethasone: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United States faces an opioid crisis with an unprecedented and increasing death rate from opioid overdose. Successfully reducing the rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose will require the engagement of frontline clinicians to prescribe opioids more safely and to build their capacity to treat patients with OUD using evidence-based approaches. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for patients, clinicians and health systems and has been associated with increasing risks of overdoses and deaths. Herein, we review a multidisciplinary project designed to implement and evaluate clinic-based interventions in Oregon, USA, to improve pain management, opioid prescribing and treatment of OUD. The intervention, called Improving PaIn aNd OPiOId MaNagemenT in Primary Care (PINPOINT), combines practice facilitation, academic detailing and education through the Oregon ECHO Network. Implementation of PINPOINT has occurred across the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network and has involved 49 clinic sites to date. To evaluate the impact of the intervention, the research team created the Provider Results of Opioid Management and Prescribing Training (PROMPT), a dataset that links information from the state prescription drug monitoring program, all-payer claims database, emergency medical services, vital records and substance use disorder treatment system. The PROMPT dataset will allow evaluation of the impact of the intervention at both the clinician and clinic levels. Due to the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, elements of both implementation and evaluation required significant adaptations to continue to meet the original project goals.","output":"COVID-19-related adaptations to the implementation and evaluation of a clinic-based intervention designed to improve opioid safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel of Coronavirus (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has quickly spread in China and exported to around the world including economically developed countries and it has hit Indonesia as well.

It is not clear whether the increased use of telemedicine will persist after the pandemic has resolved. The aims of this study were to assess the use of telemedicine by Israeli pediatricians before and during the first lockdown phase of the pandemic, and to elucidate how they foresee telemedicine as a medium of medical practice in the post-pandemic era. METHODS: A web-based survey was distributed among Israeli pediatricians in May 2020, soon after the end of first lockdown was announced. The survey assessed the frequency of telemedicine use as well as its influence on clinical decision making before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown, using two hypothetical clinical scenarios. The same scenarios were also used to assess how the pediatricians foresaw telemedicine in the post-pandemic period. In addition, administrative data from Maccabi on telemedicine use before, during and after the first lockdown were retrieved and analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-nine pediatricians responded to the survey (response rate = 40%). The percentage of respondents who reported daily use of text messages, pictures and videoconferencing increased from 24, 15 and 1% before COVID-19 to 40, 40 and 12% during the lockdown, respectively (p < 0.05). After the pandemic, projected use of text messages and pictures/videoclips was expected to decrease to 27 and 26% of respondents, respectively (p < 0.05), but pictures/videoclips were expected to increase from 15% of respondents before to 26% of respondents after (p < 0.05). The reported high likelihood of treating suspected pneumonia or prescribing antibiotics for suspected otitis media via telemedicine was expected to decrease from 20% of respondents during the COVID-19 lockdown to 6%% of respondents after (p < 0.05), and from 14% of respondents during the lockdown to 3% of respondents after, respectively. (p < 0.05). Maccabi administrative data indicated that during the lockdown, there was an increase in phone visits and a decrease in in-person visits compared to the pre-lockdown levels of use. One month after the end of the first lock-down there was a partial return to baseline levels of in-person visits and a sustained increase in phone visits. Phone visits accounted for 0% of pediatrician visits before the first lockdown, 17% of them during the lockdown, and 19% of them 1 month after the lockdown relaxation. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that use of telemedicine technologies by primary care pediatricians increased substantially during the first COVID-19 lockdown. The study also found that pediatricians expected that use levels will recede after the pandemic. As the pandemic continues and evolves, it will be important to continue to monitor the level of telemedicine use as well as expectations regarding post-pandemic use levels.","output":"The future of telemedicine visits after COVID-19: perceptions of primary care pediatricians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly malignant brain cancer. We now demonstrate that loss of function of the endosomal GTPase Rab35 in human brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) increases glioblastoma growth and decreases animal survival following BTIC implantation in mouse brains. Mechanistically, we identify that the GTPase Arf5 interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab35, DENND1/connecdenn, and allosterically enhances its GEF activity toward Rab35. Knockdown of either Rab35 or Arf5 increases cell migration, invasiveness, and self-renewal in culture and enhances the growth and invasiveness of BTIC-initiated brain tumors in mice. RNAseq of the tumors reveals up-regulation of the tumor-promoting transcription factor SPOCD1, and disruption of the Arf5/Rab35 axis in glioblastoma cells leads to strong activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, with resulting enhancement of SPOCD1 levels. These discoveries reveal an unexpected cascade between an Arf and a Rab and indicate a role for the cascade, and thus endosomal trafficking, in brain tumors.","output":"An Arf/Rab cascade controls the growth and invasiveness of glioblastoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed the importance of efficient and accommodating online educational experiences.

Based on this, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) has recently developed a digital health tool dedicated to patients with hematologic malignancies: the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this web-based platform are to generate relevant data to better understand quality of life, symptoms, and medication adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era; to develop a prospective real-life registry on outcomes of patients with hematologic cancer, with or without a diagnosis of COVID-19; and to facilitate patient-centered care in routine practice. METHODS: The platform consists of physician- and patient-secure portals and enables electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessments with real-time graphical presentation to physicians of individual patient symptoms and quality-of-life outcomes. Automated alerts are sent to treating hematologists based on the following predetermined criteria: presence of clinically important problems and symptoms, problems with adherence to therapy, and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. The platform also allows physicians to set up video consultations. Clinical information regarding disease and treatment as well as clinical and survival outcomes are also prospectively collected. RESULTS: Recruitment of participants started in December 2020. As of April 2021, a total of 116 patients have been enrolled in this study. Use of this platform may help to improve patient-physician communication and help hematologists in the early recognition of clinically important problems and symptoms of their patients. More than 20 community and university-based hospitals have currently agreed to participate. In addition to patient-reported outcome data, the prospective collection of disease- and treatment-related information, as well as data on possible COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19 vaccination, will allow the development of a large database to also identify subgroups of patients at risk of poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Data generated via this platform will help to answer clinically relevant questions for patients with hematologic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era.

Multiple tendencies in interwar thinking converge in Mayo's book, making it a veritable archive of major, minor and emergent forces, including those shaping the phenomenon of 'international health' post-Versailles. Mother India provides a unique opportunity to explore how progressive principles of international public health tend to obscure a 'minor' and forgettable yet disturbing truth: the discourse on life and health can 'safely' harbour an alternative politics and poetics of enmity. Spotlighting the way international health interventions, centrally shaped by USA, operated across multiple levels of governance, the essay locates the significant detail of Mayo's representation of India as 'world-menace'. Propelled by the logic of enmity, her shaming portrait of a dysgenic Hindu India justifying emergency international intervention resonates with a strand of interwar conservatism given theoretical expression in the writings of Mayo's contemporary, Carl Schmitt. Schmitt's animosity towards political liberalism helps identify Mother India's vision of imperial sovereignty as a curious antiliberal, American iteration of the logic of enmity in extra-European space and in the 'humane' domain of health. Biologising the discourse of juridical-political maturity at a time when Indian nationalism's organised challenge to Empire could not be gainsaid, Mother India urges a re-imagination of the political field as a battlefield where 'the enemy', construed as a problem of health, will kill. Building a case for continued imperial domination in the name of global health and immunity, the book's humiliating representation of colonial bodily habits, habitations and contagions aimed to undermine liberal imperialism, internationalism and Indian nationalism, all increasingly vocal after World War I.","output":"Nations must be defended: public health, enmity and immunity in Katherine Mayo's Mother India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We tend to overlook immigrant families in policy and program discussions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, yet they are some of the most vulnerable to the effects of this continuing crisis.

Results analyzed for this paper focused on responses to questions asked about COVID-19-related financial and familial stress, and coping resources and constraints that providers were observing with their immigrant clients. Guided by the Family Adjustment and Adaptation Response Model (Patterson, 1988), we identified a pile-up of financial and relationship stressors including employment, housing, and family relationship strains, and resource access constraints. We found that job loss in already financially vulnerable immigrant families was particularly impactful. Housing insecurity soon followed. Immigrant families also faced significant constraints to resource access including lack of documentation, fear of making a mistake, language barriers, and lack of technology skills. We identified family and community resources that families used to meet demands, coping strategies, and glimmers of resilience.

Methods: We applied an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach to elicit the impact of NPIs on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate R0 in Germany. Effectiveness was defined as the product of efficacy and compliance. A discrete, deterministic SEIR model with time step of 1 day, a latency period of 1.8 days, duration of infectiousness of 5 days, and a share of the total population of 15% assumed to be protected by immunity was developed in order to estimate the impact of selected NPI measures on the course of the pandemic. The model was populated with the Delphi-panel results and varied in sensitivity analyses. Results: Efficacy and compliance estimates for the three most effective NPIs were as follows: test and isolate 49% (efficacy)/78% (compliance), keeping distance 42%/74%, personal protection masks (cloth masks or other face masks) 33%/79%. Applying all NPI effectiveness estimates to the SEIR model resulted in a valid replication of reported occurrence of the German SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A combination of four NPIs at consented compliance rates might curb the CoViD-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Employing an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach can support SARS-CoV-2 modelling.

Preclinical and clinical studies are required to investigate if itraconazole is effective for the treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: Due to the initial absence of preclinical models, the effect of itraconazole was explored in a clinical, proof-of-concept, open-label, single-center study, in which hospitalized COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to standard of care with or without itraconazole. Primary outcome was the cumulative score of the clinical status until day 15 based on the 7-point ordinal scale of the World Health Organization. In parallel, itraconazole was evaluated in a newly established hamster model of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, as soon as the model was validated. FINDINGS: In the hamster acute infection model, itraconazole did not reduce viral load in lungs, stools or ileum, despite adequate plasma and lung drug concentrations. In the transmission model, itraconazole failed to prevent viral transmission. The clinical trial was prematurely discontinued after evaluation of the preclinical studies and because an interim analysis showed no signal for a more favorable outcome with itraconazole: mean cumulative score of the clinical status 49 vs 47, ratio of geometric means 1.01 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.19) for itraconazole vs standard of care. INTERPRETATION: Despite in vitro activity, itraconazole was not effective in a preclinical COVID-19 hamster model. This prompted the premature termination of the proof-of-concept clinical study.

The rise of new variants of concern (VOCs) represents a difficult challenge due to the loss vaccine and natural immunity, and increased transmissibility. All circulating VOCs contain mutations in the spike glycoprotein, which mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes, via its receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In an attempt to understand the effect of RBD mutations in circulating VOCs, a lot of attention has been given to the RBD-ACE2 interaction. However, this type of analysis is limited, since it ignores more indirect effects, such as the conformational dynamics of the RBD itself. Observing that some VOCs mutations occur in residues that are not in direct contact with ACE2, we hypothesized that they could affect RBD conformational dynamics. To test this, we performed long atomistic (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the structural dynamics of wt RBD, and that of three circulating VOCs (alpha, beta, and delta). Our results show that in solution, wt RBD presents two distinct conformations: an open conformation where it is free to bind ACE2; and a closed conformation, where the RBM ridge blocks the binding surface. The alpha and beta variants significantly impact the open/closed equilibrium, shifting it towards the open conformation by roughly 20%. This shift likely increases ACE2 binding affinity. Simulations of the currently predominant delta variant RBD were extreme in this regard, in that a closed conformation was never observed. Instead, the system alternated between the before mentioned open conformation and an alternative reversed one, with a significantly changed orientation of the RBM ridge flanking the RBD. This alternate conformation could potentially provide a fitness advantage not only due to increased availability for ACE2 binding, but also by aiding antibody escape through epitope occlusion. These results support the hypothesis that VOCs, and particularly the delta variant, impact RBD conformational dynamics in a direction that simultaneously promotes efficient binding to ACE2 and antibody escape.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variants impact RBD conformational dynamics and ACE2 accessibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE As the landscape in ophthalmology and related commissioning continues to change, there is a pressing need to re-evaluate the current scope of practice of hospital optometrists working within secondary care in the UK. We aim to establish if the skills or services delivered by optometrists have changed to meet varying demands, and to better understand what changes in practice may have arisen as a result of COVID-19. METHOD A survey developed from that used in 2015 was disseminated to 129 optometry Hospital Eye Service (HES) leads in September 2020, including questions on department workforce; core services; extended roles; procedures undertaken within extended roles; level of autonomy; arrangements for prescribing; training and accreditation, and service changes in response to COVID-19. RESULTS Ninety responses were received (70% response rate) from within England (76%), Scotland (22%) and Northern Ireland (2%). Whole time equivalents within units ranged from 0.4-79.2 (median of 2.5). In comparison to the 2015 survey, there was an increase in the proportion of units delivering extended roles, with glaucoma (88%) remaining the most common extended role, and new areas of practice in uveitis (21%) and vitreoretinal (13%) services. There was increased use of independent prescribing (67%) in comparison to 18% in 2015 and there was an increase in optometrists delivering laser interventions. In response to COVID-19, optometrists were increasingly delivering telephone consultations and there were new collaborations between primary and secondary care. CONCLUSIONS Optometrists' scope of practice continues to develop in the HES with an increased variety of roles and an apparent increase in the number of units employing optometrists, often working in roles historically performed by medical practitioners.

In this work we argue that the learners perception of the level of usability of a system is a valuable metric that gives an insight into the learners engagement and motivation to learn. Little attention has been paid to this metric. In this paper we explore why this is important and valuable. We present a case study which uses the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire to measure the users perception of usability as an indirect (proxy) measure of engagement. A between-subject experiment was conducted with 41 learners with dyslexia. The intervention group used the adaptive version of the e-learning system that matched the material to the needs of the learner. The control group used a standard version. At the end, learning gain and SUS scores were assessed. The correlation between learning performance and the perceived level of usability was positive and moderate (0.517, p < 0.05) among participants in the intervention group. However, learning performance and perceived level of usability were unrelated in the control group (? 0.364, p > 0.05). From this, and other work, it appears that using a learners assessment of the usability of a system is an effective way to measure their attitude to their learning. It reflects their perception of its suitability to their needs and this, in turn, is likely to affect their engagement and motivation. As such, this provides an effective instrument to judge whether adaptation based on learner needs has been successful.","output":"Perceived Level of Usability as an Evaluation Metric in Adaptive E-learning: A Case Study with Dyslexic Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In developing contexts such as India, children in adversity form a high-risk group, one that cannot be subsumed under the general category of children, who are generally considered as a vulnerable group in disaster and crisis situations.

In most studies, associations between chronic pain and suicidality are robust, even after adjusting for the effect of sociodemographics and psychiatric comorbidity, and particularly for depressive conditions. A number of specific conditions that can modulate suicidality risk in patients with chronic pain have been investigated, but there is a need for their more specific characterization. Numerous recent studies have shown that demoralization and meaning in life (MiL) constructs affect suicidality as risk and protective factors, respectively. These constructs have been mainly investigated in patients with somatic illness and in community-dwelling individuals who may present with SI or SB independently of a psychiatric diagnosis of depression. However, a paucity of studies investigated them in suicidal patients affected by chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between demoralization and MiL on SI risk in patients with chronic pain. The secondary objectives are (1) to test whether demoralization can occur independently of depression in patients with chronic pain and SI, (2) to examine whether the expected association between demoralization and SI may be explained by a sole dimension of demoralization: hopelessness, (3) to examine whether the presence of MiL, but not the search for MiL, is associated with less SI, and (4) to explore whether previously described MiL profiles (ie, high presence-high search, high presence-low search, moderate presence-moderate search, low presence-low search, and low presence-high search) emerge in our cohort. METHODS: This project is a single-center, observational, case-control studythe Demoralization and Meaning in Life (DEMiL) studyconducted by the Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, and the Service of Liaison Psychiatry and Crisis Intervention at the Geneva University Hospitals. Self- and hetero-administered questionnaires were conducted among patients and controls, matched by age and gender. The Ethics Committee of the Canton of Geneva approved the scientific utilization of collected data (project No. 2017-02138; decision dated January 25, 2018). Data have been analyzed with SPSS, version 23.0, software (IBM Corp). RESULTS: From March 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019, 70 patients and 70 controls were enrolled. Statistical analyses are still in progress and are expected to be finalized in November 2020. To date, we did not observe any unfavorable event for which a causal relationship with the collection of health-related personal data could be ruled out. Results of this study are expected to form the basis for possible prevention and psychotherapeutic interventions oriented toward demoralization and MiL constructs for suicidal patients with chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: The interest in exploring demoralization and MiL in chronic pain patients with SI arises from the common clinical observation that experiencing chronic pain often requires a revision of ones life goals and expectations. Hence, the impact of chronic pain is not limited to patients biopsychosocial functioning, but it affects the existential domain as well. The major clinical implications in suicidal patients with chronic pain consist in trying to (1) delineate a more precise and individualized suicide risk profile, (2) improve detection and prevention strategies by investigating SI also in individuals who do not present with a clinically diagnosed depression, and (3) enhance the panel of interventions by broadening supportive or psychotherapeutic actions, taking into consideration the existential condition of a person who suffers and strives to deal with his or her suffering.

The final aim is to provide a synthesis of the timeliest evidence upon which clinical and non-clinical decision-makers can rely to make choices about technology in the case of further pandemic waves. Methods: A review of reviews was performed alongside a review of the studies run during the first pandemic wave. PsycInfo, CINAHL, and PubMed-online were the databases inspected for relevant papers published from January 2010. Results: The search identified 420 articles, 30 of which were reviews and nine of which were new studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies were first sorted according to the target population, then summarized thematically in a narrative synthesis. The studies targeting technologies for PWD were categorized as follows: monitoring and security purposes, sustaining daily life, and therapeutic interventions. Each category showed potential benefits. Differently, the interventions for caregivers were classified as informative, psycho-education programs, psychosocial-supportive, therapeutic, and cognitive/physical training. Benefits to mental health, skills learning, and social aspects emerged. Conclusions: The evidence shows that technology is well-accepted and can support PWD and caregivers to bypass physical and environmental problems both during regular times and during future pandemic waves.

In the model, the contact and infection of individuals at the micro scale where an agent represents a person provide insights for the interactions of agents at the meso scale where an agent refers to hundreds of individuals. Four cities with frequent population movements in China are taken as an example and actual data on traffic patterns and demographic parameters are adopted. The scenarios for dynamic propagation of infectious disease with no external measures are compared versus the scenarios with vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions. The model predicts that the peak of infections will decline by 67.37% with 80% vaccination rate, compared to a drop of 89.56% when isolation and quarantine measures are also in place. The results highlight the importance of controlling the source of infection by isolation and quarantine throughout the epidemic. We also study the effect when cities implement inconsistent public health interventions, which is common in practical situations.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are commonly immunosuppressed with immunomodulators, biologics, and steroids. Therefore, IBD patients have been considered as a risk population for COVID-19. Yet, emerging epidemiologic data may indicate otherwise. It is still unclear, however, how COVID-19 infection affects IBD patients and how seroconversion against the virus might take place depending upon disease states and treatments. We describe a single center cohort of pediatric IBD patients with COVID-19, a subset of whom were tested for seroconversion subsequent to the laboratory test supported infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: The electronic medical records of pediatric IBD patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab based PCR testing were included in the study. The clinical course of IBD, concurrent medications, COVID-19 related symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing date, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing date and result were examined. A total of 13 pediatric IBD patients at Texas Childrens Hospital tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patient demographics and specifics of IBD disease and management are detailed in table 1. Management was not altered in any of these patients in response to the positive COVID-19 test. Seven (53.8%) had symptoms including fever, sore throat, fatigue, loss of taste, dizziness, loss of smell, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea; six (46.2%) were asymptomatic. No patients required hospitalization attributed to COVID-19. Of the 13 patients, 6 (46.2%) have been already tested for seroconversion. Four (67.7%) had elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG of whom 3 patients (50%) had acute and resolved symptoms; one (16.7%) had an ambiguous serology (reactive total IgG and IgM but negative IgG and IgM individually), and one (16.7%) had nonreactive antibody titers. Seroconversion was tested between 0.4, or 4 to 13.7 weeks after initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. The close antibody testing at 0.4 weeks had the ambiguous results. Serologic testing for the additional cases is pending. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a cohort of pediatric IBD patients with COVID-19 ranging from 1 week to 4 months after infection whose disease course has not been significantly affected. A large proportion of patients tested for seroconversion were found to mount a detectable IgG based immune response in spite of their medical immunosuppression. More research needs to be performed to evaluate the importance of seroconversion with relation to disease course andCOVID-19 reinfection in pediatric IBD patients.

Early detection and evaluation of their associated risk of spreading within the population are pivotal. METHODS: Between April 2020 and February 2021, the UK Lighthouse Labs Network at Alderley Park tested more than eight million nose and throat swab samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, via PCR. The assay targeted three genomic regions of the virus: N, Orf1ab and S. Whole-genome next-generation sequencing was used to confirm positive PCR results. Positive results were mapped using the postal district origin of samples to allow real-time tracking of the spread of a new variant through the UK. FINDINGS: In mid-November 2020, the assay identified an increasing number of S gene negative, N and Orf1ab positive samples. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that the loss of S gene detection was due to the appearance of a SARS-CoV-2 lineage (B.1.1.7) designated as Variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01. By the beginning of January 2021, the new SARS-CoV-2 VOC comprised 70% of daily positive samples tested at Alderley Park and 98% by the end of February 2021. INTERPRETATION: The timeline view identified the rapid spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant across England during the first three weeks of December. Coupling high-throughput diagnostics and molecular surveillance was pivotal to the early detection of the spread of this variant. The availability of real-time tracking of an emerging variant is an important new tool to inform decision-making authorities for risk mitigation.

In humans, disease is primarily caused by influenza A and B viruses, while influenza C virus causes mild disease mostly in children. Influenza D is an emerging virus found in cattle and pigs. To mitigate the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza, rapid and accurate diagnostic tests need to be deployed. However, the high genetic diversity displayed by influenza viruses presents a challenge to the development of a robust diagnostic test. Nucleic acid-based tests are more accurate than rapid antigen tests for influenza and are therefore better candidates to be used in both diagnostic and surveillance applications. Here, we review various nucleic acid-based techniques that have been applied towards the detection of influenza viruses in order to evaluate their utility as both diagnostic and surveillance tools. We discuss both traditional as well as novel methods to detect influenza viruses by covering techniques that require nucleic acid amplification or direct detection of viral RNA as well as comparing advantages and limitations for each method. There has been substantial progress in the development of nucleic acid-based sensing techniques for the detection of influenza virus. However, there is still an urgent need for a rapid and reliable influenza diagnostic test that can be used at point-of-care in order to enhance responsiveness to both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks.","output":"Nucleic Acid-Based Sensing Techniques for Diagnostics and Surveillance of Influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kidney transplantation at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging.

Pneumatic dilation, botulinum toxin injection, and previous myotomy increase the difficulty of subsequent Heller myotomy, but their impact on POEM remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare patients who had undergone prior treatment for their achalasia to those undergoing POEM as an initial therapy. METHODS AND PROCEDURES All patients undergoing POEM were entered into a prospective database from August 2012 to October 2014. Data collected included demographics, dysphagia and symptom survey scores, operative time, clips required for mucosotomy closure, perioperative complications and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Forty-five patients underwent POEM during the study period. Fifteen (30%) had undergone previous treatment (seven Botox injection, five pneumatic dilation and three Heller myotomy). Primary POEM patients were younger than those who had had prior treatment (mean age 46  17 vs. 64  12 years, p < 0.001), but gender, body mass index and ASA class were not significantly different. There were no conversions to Heller myotomy or perioperative complications in either group. Operative time for primary POEM was 103  27 versus 102  29 min following prior treatment (p = 0.84). Mucosotomy closure required a median 7 (4-16) and 8 (5-16) clips, respectively (p = 0.08). Length of stay was 1 day in each group. Median dysphagia scores decreased from 4 (0-5) to 1 (0-4) following primary POEM and 4 (0-5) to 0 (0-4) in the prior treatment group (p = 0.45) during a median follow-up of 10 months (5-17 months). All patients in each group expressed satisfaction with their procedure and would undergo the procedure again given the benefit of hindsight. CONCLUSION Per-oral endoscopic myotomy is a safe and effective treatment for achalasia which improves dysphagia and disease-specific quality of life.

In South Africa (SA), a nationwide lockdown was implemented at midnight on 26 March to prepare for the predicted surge and slow the spread of the virus. OBJECTIVES: To compare the volume and type of presentations of trauma secondary to interpersonal violence and road traffic collisions (RTCs) during two 5-month periods, from February to June 2019 and 2020, in the emergency department (ED) of an academic tertiary hospital in Gauteng Province, SA. In 2020, February - June included the lockdown period. METHODS: An observational retrospective audit of the patient register at the Helen Joseph Hospital ED was conducted, comparing the number of trauma presentations secondary to interpersonal violence (assaults with gunshot wounds, general assaults including mob assaults, assaults with stab wounds) and RTC presentations between February and June 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: A total of 4 300 trauma presentations secondary to interpersonal violence and RTCs were noted in the 5-month period February - June 2019, as opposed to 3 239 presentations in February - June 2020 (25% decline). A 40% decline in the number of RTCs, from 1 704 in February - June 2019 to 1 026 in the corresponding period for 2020, was noted and found to be statistically significant (p=0.03). Declines in the volume of trauma cases secondary to interpersonal violence and of overall trauma cases were only directional in favour of 2020, but not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of trauma presentations secondary to interpersonal violence and RTCs in the Helen Joseph Hospital ED decreased during the lockdown period.

We used a phylodynamics approach to better understand this sub-epidemic by analyzing 270 HIV-1 polymerase (pol) sequences collected from persons diagnosed with HIV/AIDS between 1995 and 2019. Using network analyses at a 1.5% genetic distance threshold (d), we found a large 154-member outbreak cluster composed mostly of persons who inject drugs (PWID) that were predominantly men. At d = 0.5%, which was used to identify more recent transmission, the large cluster dissociated into three clusters of 18, 12, and 7 members, respectively, five dyads, and 107 singletons. Phylogenetic analysis of the Bulgarian sequences with publicly available global sequences showed that CRF01_AE likely originated from multiple Asian countries, with Vietnam as the likely source of the outbreak cluster between 1988 and 1990. Our findings indicate that CRF01_AE was introduced into Bulgaria multiple times since 1988, and infections then rapidly spread among PWID locally with bridging to other risk groups and countries. CRF01_AE continues to spread in Bulgaria as evidenced by the more recent large clusters identified at d = 0.5%, highlighting the importance of public health prevention efforts in the PWID communities.","output":"Molecular Epidemiological Analysis of the Origin and Transmission Dynamics of the HIV-1 CRF01_AE Sub-Epidemic in Bulgaria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adult day centers (ADCs) are nonresidential settings that support the health and social needs of vulnerable older adults.

Development of an aneurysm typically occurs during adulthood, while formation and growth are associated with risk factors such as age, hypertension, pre-existing familial conditions, and smoking. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most common presentation due to aneurysm rupture, represents a serious medical condition often leading to severe neurological deficit or death. Recent technological advances in imaging modalities, along with increased understanding of natural history and prevalence of aneurysms, have increased detection of asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). Studies reporting on the risk of rupture and outcomes have provided much insight, but the debate remains of how and when unruptured aneurysms should be managed. Treatment methods include two major intervention options: clipping of the aneurysm and endovascular methods such as coiling, stent-assisted coiling, and flow diversion stents. The studies reviewed here support the generalized notion that endovascular treatment of UIA provides a safe and effective alternative to surgical treatment. The risks associated with endovascular repair are lower and incur shorter hospital stays for appropriately selected patients. The endovascular treatment option should be considered based on factors such as aneurysm size, location, patient medical history, and operator experience.","output":"Intracranial aneurysms: review of current treatment options and outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The electrical and optical properties of Ag/pCGaN contacts have been investigated as a function of the annealing temperature, oxygen concentration, and annealing time.

We found that the participation of oxygen improves the formation of ohmic contacts. Oxygen might remove the H in MgCH complexes to activate the Mg acceptors and enhance Ga out-diffusion to form an AgCGa solid solution.

Twenty positive nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens with low to high viral load were selected and pooled individually with four and nine negative NP. RESULTS: In NP specimens, the sensitivity of pools of 5 and 10 were 90 and 85%, compared to individual sample testing, respectively. The RT-qPCR sensitivity of pools of 5 and 10 against individual testing were not significantly different (p > 0.05).

RESULTS: We included 16 case series and 12 case reports describing a total of 223 pregnant women and 201 infants. Four newborns born to mothers affected by COVID-19 were reported to have laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within 48 hours after birth. However, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction tests of the breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluids, and cord blood and maternal vaginal secretions were all negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the reported cases. Fetal death was reported in two cases, and 48 of 185 newborns (25.9%) were born prematurely. Infants born small for gestational age and low birth weight (< 2,500 g) accounted for 8.3% and 15.6% of reported cases, respectively. Birth asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome were observed in 1.8% and 6.4% of neonates, respectively.

Individuals with COPD typically experience a progressive, debilitating decline in lung function as well as systemic manifestations of the disease. Multimorbidity, is common in COPD patients and increases the risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Central to the genesis of multimorbidity in COPD patients is a self-perpetuating, abnormal immune and inflammatory response driven by factors including ageing, pollutant inhalation (including smoking) and infection. As many patients with COPD have multiple concurrent chronic conditions, which require an integrative management approach, there is a need to greater understand the shared disease mechanisms contributing to multimorbidity. The intercellular transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has recently been proposed as an important method of local and distal cell-to-cell communication mediating both homeostatic and pathological conditions. EVs have been identified in many biological fluids and provide a stable capsule for the transfer of cargo including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Of these cargo, microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short 17-24 nucleotide non-coding RNA molecules, have been amongst the most extensively studied. There is evidence to support that miRNA are selectively packaged into EVs and can regulate recipient cell gene expression including major pathways involved in inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis. Furthermore changes in EV cargo including miRNA have been reported in many chronic diseases and in response to risk factors including respiratory infections, noxious stimuli and ageing. In this review, we discuss the potential of EVs and EV-associated miRNA to modulate shared pathological processes in chronic diseases. Further delineating these may lead to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for patients with COPD and multimorbidities.","output":"The Role of Extracellular Vesicles as a Shared Disease Mechanism Contributing to Multimorbidity in Patients With COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Correlated activation of cortical neurons often occurs in the brain and repetitive correlated neuronal firing could cause long-term modifications of synaptic efficacy and intrinsic excitability. We found that repetitive optogenetic activation of neuronal populations in the mouse cortex caused enhancement of optogenetically evoked firing of local coactivated neurons as well as distant cortical neurons in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. This global enhancement of evoked responses required coactivation of a sufficiently large population of neurons either within one cortical area or distributed in several areas. Enhancement of neuronal firing was saturable after repeated episodes of coactivation, diminished by inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors, and accompanied by elevated excitatory postsynaptic potentials, all consistent with activity-induced synaptic potentiation. Chemogenetic inhibition of neuronal activity of the thalamus decreased the enhancement effect, suggesting thalamic involvement.

Currently, COVID-19 pandemic is a life-threatening unpredictable condition accompanied with a large number of uncertainties. The present study has mainly aimed to assess mental health and the relevant social factors during this pandemic in Fars province. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 922 participants in Fars province, Iran, using internet-based data collection technique. All the included participants filled out the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Moreover, demographic variables and some social factors were evaluated by asking some questions. All the participants were ensured of the confidentiality of the collected data, and willingly completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the participants, there were 629 women (68.2%) and 293 men (31.2%). The mean age of the participants was 36.98  11.08 years old. Four hundred twenty-five subjects (46.1%) obtained GHQ-28 scores above the cut-off point, and accordingly, they were suspected of having poor mental health statuses. Women, in comparison to men (OR = 2.034, 95%:1.62-3.28), and individuals aged < 50 years old, in comparison to those aged > 50 years old (OR: 4.01 95%:2.15-7.50), have poorer mental health statuses. Trusting on media, health authorities, and cooperation with policy makers, as well as having uncertainty on information about Coronavirus pandemic were also shown to be associated with poor mental health condition (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that the number of those people with suspected poor mental health in Fars province significantly increased compared to a previous study using the same questionnaire. Furthermore, the participants who had less trust in media and policymakers were more prone to mental health problems. Therefore, it can be concluded that supporting people in these life-threatening pandemic crises is of great importance, so the policy makers and media must present reliable and valid information to people as soon as possible.","output":"Mental health status during COVID-19 pandemic in Fars Province, Iran: timely measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are large between- and within-country variations in COVID-19 death rates. Some very low death rate settings such as Eastern Asia, Central Europe, the Balkans and Africa have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented foods whose intake is associated with the activation of the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) anti-oxidant transcription factor. There are many Nrf2-interacting nutrients (berberine, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, quercetin, resveratrol, sulforaphane) that all act similarly to reduce insulin resistance, endothelial damage, lung injury and cytokine storm. They also act on the same mechanisms (mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin, PPAR:Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, NFB: Nuclear factor kappa B, ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases and eIF2:Elongation initiation factor 2). They may as a result be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, acting through the endoplasmic reticulum stress or ACE-Angiotensin-II-AT(1)R axis (AT(1)R) pathway. Many Nrf2-interacting nutrients are also interacting with TRPA1 and/or TRPV1. Interestingly, geographical areas with very low COVID-19 mortality are those with the lowest prevalence of obesity (Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia). It is tempting to propose that Nrf2-interacting foods and nutrients can re-balance insulin resistance and have a significant effect on COVID-19 severity. It is therefore possible that the intake of these foods may restore an optimal natural balance for the Nrf2 pathway and may be of interest in the mitigation of COVID-19 severity.","output":"Nrf2-interacting nutrients and COVID-19: time for research to develop adaptation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the importance of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for preventing COVID-19 transmission, the aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the use of PPE from the perspective of the nurses caring for COVID-19 patients.

Clinical and experimental evidence have shown that the multifunctional inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 plays a significant role in epilepsy. However, the role of IL-6 in neuronal networks remains unclear. In this study, we modelled seizure-like activity in hPSC-derived cortical neurons using kainic acid (KA) and explored the effects of IL-6 and its counterpart, hyper-IL-6 (H-IL-6), a fusion protein consisting of IL-6 and its soluble receptor, IL-6R. In the seizure-like model, functionally mature neuronal networks responded to KA induction with an increased bursting phenotype at the single electrode level, while network level bursts decreased. The IL-6 receptors, IL6R and gp130, were expressed in hPSC-derived cortical neurons, and the gene expression of IL6R increased during maturation. Furthermore, the expression of IL-6R increased not only after IL-6 and H-IL-6 treatment but also after KA treatment. Stimulation with IL-6 or H-IL-6 was not toxic to the neurons and cytokine pretreatment did not independently modulate neuronal network activity or KA-induced seizures. Furthermore, the increased expression of IL-6R in response to IL-6, H-IL-6 and KA implies that neurons can respond through both classical and trans-signaling pathways. Acute treatment with IL-6 and H-IL-6 did not alter functional activity, suggesting that IL-6 does not affect the induction or modulation of newly induced seizures in healthy cultures.

Therefore, many elective diagnostic and surgical procedures are being suspended or significantly delayed. Moreover, patients might find it difficult to refer to physicians and delay the diagnostic and even the therapeutic procedures because of emotional or logistic problems. The effect of diagnostic and therapeutic delay on survival in patients affected by gastrointestinal malignancies is still unclear. METHODS We carried out a review of the available literature, in order to determine whether the delay in performing diagnosis and curative-intent surgical procedures affects the oncological outcomes in patients with oesophageal, gastric, colorectal cancers, and colorectal liver metastasis. RESULTS The findings indicate that for oesophageal, gastric and colon cancers delaying surgery up to 2 months after the end of the staging process does not worsen the oncological outcomes. Oesophageal cancer should undergo surgery within 7-8 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Rectal cancers should undergo surgery within 31 days after the diagnostic process and within 12 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy should start within 4 weeks after surgery, especially in gastric cancer; a delay up to 42 days may be allowed for oesophageal cancer undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Gastrointestinal malignancies can be safely managed taking into account that reasonable delays of planned treatments appear a generally safe approach, not having a significant impact on long-term oncological outcome.","output":"Could diagnostic and therapeutic delay affect the prognosis of gastrointestinal primary malignancies in the COVID-19 pandemic era?

We have previously demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by primary human airway epithelial cells (AEC) deliver miRNA let-7b-5p to P. aeruginosa where it suppresses biofilm formation and increases sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. In this study we used RNA-seq to characterize the small RNA (sRNA) content of EVs secreted by AEC and demonstrate transfer of multiple distinct RNA fragments from EVs to P. aeruginosa. Bioinformatic predictions reveal that several sRNAs may target all three subunits of the fluoroquinolone efflux pump MexHI-OpmD, an effect predicted to increase antibiotic sensitivity to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Exposure of P. aeruginosa to EVs resulted in a significant reduction in the protein levels of MexH (?48%), MexI (?50%) and OpmD (?35%). Moreover, EVs reduced planktonic growth of P. aeruginosa in the presence of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin by 20%. A mexGHI-opmD deletion mutant of P. aeruginosa phenocopied this increased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. Finally, we found that a fragment of an 18S rRNA external transcribed spacer that was transferred to P. aeruginosa by EVs was sufficient to reduce planktonic growth of P. aeruginosa in the presence of ciprofloxacin, to reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of P. aeruginosa for ciprofloxacin by over 50%, and to significantly reduce protein levels of MexH and OpmD. In conclusion, an rRNA fragment secreted by AEC in EVs increases the ciprofloxacin sensitivity of P. aeruginosa by targeting and down-regulating the fluoroquinolone efflux pump MexHI-OpmD. A combination of rRNA fragments and ciprofloxacin packaged in nanoparticles or EVs may benefit patients with antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa infections. Author Summary According to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are a significant global threat to human health. Thus, development of new approaches to eliminate antibiotic resistant infections is required. In this study, we report that lung epithelial cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that fuse with and deliver small rRNAs to P. aeruginosa, and that the rRNAs increase the sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin by reducing protein levels of the drug efflux pump MexHI-OpmD. We identified one rRNA fragment that by itself significantly reduced the protein levels of MexH and OpmD and increased the ability of ciprofloxacin to kill P. aeruginosa. We propose that developing synthetic vesicles containing a combination of the rRNA that inhibits antibiotic efflux pumps and ciprofloxacin would benefit patients with antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa infections.","output":"An rRNA fragment in extracellular vesicles secreted by human airway epithelial cells increases the fluoroquinolone sensitivity of P. aeruginosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak heavily attacked Italy, putting a strain for an extended time on the National healthcare system.

This retrospective comparative study intended to investigate the impact of the lockdown imposed in Italy, in two different periods, during the COVID-19 outbreak on acute orthopedic trauma, in order to identify significant issues for improvement and future preparation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data on total trauma access to a single University hospital DEA (Department of Emergency and Acceptance) in Rome during two periods of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Italy: from March 9th, 2020 to May 4th, 2020(Phase 1), from May 10th, 2020 to June 30th, 2020(Phase 2) and then comparing them with the analogous period in 2019. We recorded demographic data; the characteristics of the lesion, including the anatomical area, fracture, sprain, dislocation, contusion, laceration, whether the lesion site was exposed or closed, where the trauma occurred and polytrauma. We also reported the waiting time in the emergency room and the mode of transport. RESULT: The study sample was composed of 1655 patients, 894 (54%) males and 761 (46%) females. The overall number of admissions in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) was 995; then it was 204 during Phase 1 and increased again to 456 during Phase 2. The average age of the Phase 1 group was 51.9  24.8 years, signicantly higher than that of the 2019 group (41.4  25.7) and Phase 2 group (42.2  22.5 years) (p<0.0001). In particular, elderly patients (>=65 years) were the most commonly involved in the Phase 1 group, while in the pre-COVID-19 period and in Phase 2 they were middle-aged adults (15-44 years) (p<0.0001). The injury occurred at home in 66.2% of cases in the Phase 1 group, in 32.3% of cases in the Phase 2 group and in 32.3% of patients in the 2019 group. Concerning the injury type, in all groups, the most frequent injury was a fracture (45.1% in 2019; 62.7% in Phase 1; 50% Phase2) (p<0.0001). The most injured anatomical section during Phase 1 was the upper limb (43.1%), while in the pre-COVID-19 group and in Phase 2 group the most frequent injury location was the lower limb (48.3% and 40.8% respectively). CONCLUSION: Despite the decrease of overall acute trauma referral rates during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, the incidence of fractures in elderly people remained constant, indicating that not all trauma presentations would inevitably decrease during such circumstances.","output":"The Effect of Shelter-In-Place on Orthopedic Trauma Volumes in Italy During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The socialism-to-market transition is over but has left its marks on the transitioning economies.

In writing this paper, to access information, the keywords of Coronavirus, COVID-19, burn, strategy, care, and SARS were used. Due to the emergence of COVID disease, searches in Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SID, Magiran, Springer, and Elsevier databases were performed without time limit. Research articles were purposefully selected and approved to be investigated based on the criteria for entering the research. A total of 14 articles had a full text related to the research scope. The researchers used qualitative content analysis to analyze the data. Data analysis was conducted as a comprehensive review of articles, qualitative conclusions, and results. RESULTS: In this study, 14 articles related to burn care strategies in the COVID-19 epidemic were selected. Their results were reviewed in two areas of staff care strategies and burn patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings indicate that appropriate prevention and protection strategies and measures should be followed to prevent the transmission of the COVID-19 virus to burn care professionals. In addition, burn patient care strategies were proposed in two levels of minor and moderate to severe burns, so that patients with burns receive adequate burn care during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION: Implementation of staff and burn patient care strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to treat burn patients and prevent the spread of the COVID virus.","output":"Burn care strategy in the covid-19 pandemic: a narrative review study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The objective of this research is to develop a convolutional neural network model ?COVID-Screen-Net? for multi-class classification of chest X-ray images into three classes viz COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, and normal The model performs the automatic feature extraction from X-ray images and accurately identifies the features responsible for distinguishing the X-ray images of different classes It plots these features on the GradCam The authors optimized the number of convolution and activation layers according to the size of the dataset They also fine-tuned the hyperparameters to minimize the computation time and to enhance the efficiency of the model The performance of the model has been evaluated on the anonymous chest X-ray images collected from hospitals and the dataset available on the web The model attains an average accuracy of 97 71% and a maximum recall of 100% The comparative analysis shows that the ?COVID-Screen-Net? outperforms the existing systems for screening of COVID-19 The effectiveness of the model is validated by the radiology experts on the real-time dataset Therefore, it may prove a useful tool for quick and low-cost mass screening of patients of COVID-19 This tool may reduce the burden on health experts in the present situation of the Global Pandemic The copyright of this tool is registered in the names of authors under the laws of Intellectual Property Rights in India with the registration number ?SW-13625/2020?","output":"A deep learning model for mass screening of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children have mild severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confirmed disease (COVID-19) compared to adults and the immunological mechanisms underlying this difference remain unclear.

We find clinically mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is characterised by reduced circulating subsets of monocytes (classical, intermediate, non-classical), dendritic cells and natural killer cells during the acute phase. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-infected adults show reduced proportions of non-classical monocytes only. We also observe increased proportions of CD63+ activated neutrophils during the acute phase to SARS-CoV-2 in infected children. Children and adults exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but negative on PCR testing display increased proportions of low-density neutrophils that we observe up to 7 weeks post exposure.

OBJECTIVES to analyze the effectiveness of the measurement of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV2 (IgM and IgG) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to analyze the rate of SARS-CoV2 seroprevalence in the population. METHODS 11 relevant studies, published before June 5, 2020, were included in this meta-analysis. These studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE and Scopus databases. The final selected studies were analyzed using STATA version 14. Publication bias was examined using both Egger's test and Funnel plots. Moreover, the I2 statistic has been used to evaluate and verify heterogeneity. RESULTS The 11 relevant studies selected for the present meta-analysis cover a total of 996 infection cases. According to the results, the average rate of positive cases for IgM (AU/mL) was 2.10 (95% CI: 1.65-2.55; I2=92.2%), and the sensitivity in individuals with positive IgM test was 63% (95% CI: 47-79; I2=94.9%). In addition, the average rate of positive cases for IgG (AU/mL) was 67.44 (95% CI: 28.79-106.09; I2=99.4%), and the sensitivity in individuals with positive IgG test was 79% (95% CI: 67-90; I2=89.5%). CONCLUSIONS According to this analysis, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies may assist early detection of SARS-CoV2 infection. Whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 confer protective immunity warrants further studies.","output":"Seroprevalence of Immunoglobulin M and G Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Virus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused temporary yet significant changes in young childrens learning environments around the world. In Turkey and many other countries where young children are commonly taken care of at home, a notable pandemic-related change was the increased presence of the father at home. This study utilized this unusual situation to examine the contributions of mothers and fathers in language learning. A two-part online survey was administered to the parents of an 8- to 36- month-old, and we analyzed data from 128 families at Time 1 (Mage = 21.91) and 52 families at Time 2 (Mage = 25.09). As a proxy of the parental language input, we asked the parents to write a story about a picture as if they were telling a bedtime story to their child.

Aims: To explore service users' and their partners' experiences of maternity services in the North of England during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Respondents (n=606) completed a co-produced survey during August 2020. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Findings: Five major categories were identified: valuing support from health professionals, feeling lost in and let down by the system, the impact of restrictions to partners and others, virtual contact is not the same as in-person contact, and the need for emotional and psychological wellbeing support. Conclusion: The changes implemented may have compromised mental health and wellbeing in a critical period of vulnerability. Bringing stakeholders together can maximise learning from the emergency measures, to better inform future service provision. Work is needed to better hear from minoritised groups and ensure they are not further marginalised by changes.

Although the structures and evolutionary origins of viral fusion proteins vary widely, all fusion proteins use the same physical principles and topology to drive membrane fusion. First, exposure of a hydrophobic fusion anchor allows them to insert into the host-cell membrane. Conserved hydrophobic residues in the fusion anchor penetrate part way into the outer bilayer leaflet of the host-cell membrane. The fusion protein then folds back on itself, directing the C-terminal viral transmembrane anchor toward the fusion loop. This fold-back forces the host-cell membrane (held by the fusion loop) and the viral membrane (held by the C-terminal transmembrane anchor) against one another until they fuse. In West Nile virus and other flaviviruses this fold-back in the fusion protein, E, is triggered by the reduced pH of an endosome, is accompanied by the assembly of E monomers into trimers, and occurs by domain rearrangement rather than by an extensive refolding of secondary structure. The rearrangement releases a large amount of energy, which is used to exert a bending force on the apposed viral and cellular membranes, propelling them toward each other and, eventually, causing them to fuse. The conserved regions of E that are responsible for driving membrane fusion are attractive targets for antiviral therapies.","output":"Molecular Mechanisms of Flaviviral Membrane Fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We assessed the impact of implementing a virtual emergency room (VER) in easing emergency room (ER) visits in patients suspected of having COVID-19.

Patients could choose to either visiting ER or using the VER (implemented in March 2021). Medical records were revised for demographic and clinical data. The primary outcome was the number of visits. Results: A total of 32,822 visits were evaluated. HR was more than three times less in the VER group with <10% VER clients going to ER. The trend and volume of use of the emergency sector in the periods did not show a statistically significant difference, despite the higher number of cases in the second period.

There remains a significant unmet need for patients with hematological malignancies requiring specialized procedures and treatments, like cellular therapy to treat or cure their disease. For instance, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is approved for relapsed/refractory (after two or more lines of therapy) diffuse large B cell lymphoma and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in the second relapse in patients younger than 25 years of age. Similarly, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be a lifesaving procedure for many patients, such as those with acute myeloid leukemia with high-risk cytogenetics. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrust upon the hematologists and transplant specialists' unique challenges with the implementation and management of cellular therapy. One of the significant concerns regarding this immunocompromised patient population is the significant risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its highly contagious nature. Experts have recommended that if medically indicated, especially in high-risk disease (where chemotherapy is unlikely to work), these lifesaving procedures should not be delayed even during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, proceeding with CAR-T cell therapy and HSCT during the pandemic is a considerable task and requires dedication from the transplant team and buy-in from the patients and their family or support system. Open conversations should be held with the patients about the risks involved in undergoing cellular therapies during current times and the associated future uncertainties.","output":"Challenges of Cellular Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Instructors in medical and health fields have long used experiential learning activities to complement traditional methods of teaching The following details a scenario developed for a health communication course that simulates a plague outbreak and requires students to draw from best practice related to crisis and emergency risk communication, patientCprovider communication, and health promotion targeting behavior change Sorted into a variety of stakeholder groups, students win the game by accomplishing two objectives: (1) assembling puzzle pieces to unlock a cure, and (2) demonstrating effective communication capacities throughout the scenario so that the public accepts the cure The experience of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has served as a means to reflect on what works and what needs to be modified in this scenario ? 2021 National Communication Association","output":"Pandemic pedagogy: Experiential learning illustrating risk and health communication principles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study takes an affiliative coping theory perspective to examine whether working adults reactivated dormant ties with individuals they had not contacted for at least 3 years to cope with stressors experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stressors originating in the workplace (job insecurity and remote work) and in the family (stressful familial social ties) were examined in a sample of 232 working adults in the southeastern United States. Individuals were more likely to reactivate their dormant ties when their job was insecure, and the magnitude of the reactivations was greater among individuals experiencing stressful social ties with family members than those not experiencing those stressors. We also found that there was a significant interaction between remote work and having a stressful tie within the household in dormant tie reactivation. Although previous theory has focused mostly on the benefits of frequent, active social relationships for coping, our results suggest that reactivating dormant ties might be a coping mechanism as well. Our study also suggests that workplace dormant tie research should broaden its focus beyond exchanged instrumental support to consider emotional support that might be transferred during reactivation.

Their activity in stored red blood cells (RBCs) is affected by both storage time and the donor's characteristics. However, apart from their abundancy in the membrane proteome, not much is known about their topology, activity, and networking during the storage of RBCs from beta-thalassemia trait donors (Thal+). For this purpose, RBC units from fourteen Thal+ donors were fractionated and studied for proteasome activity distribution and interactome through fluorometric and correlation analyses against units of sex- and aged-matched controls. In all the samples examined, we observed a time-dependent translocation and/or activation of the proteasome in the membrane and a tight connection of activity with the oxidative burden of cells. Proteasomes were more active in the Thal+ membranes and supernatants, while the early storage networking of 20S core particles and activities showed a higher degree of connectivity with chaperones, calpains, and peroxiredoxins, which were nonetheless present in all interactomes. Moreover, the Thal+ interactomes were specially enriched in kinases, metabolic enzymes, and proteins differentially expressed in Thal+ membrane, including arginase-1, piezo-1, and phospholipid scramblase. Overall, it seems that Thal+ erythrocytes maintain a considerable \\"proteo-vigilance\\" during storage, which is closely connected to their distinct antioxidant dynamics and membrane protein profile.","output":"Red Blood Cell Proteasome in Beta-Thalassemia Trait: Topology of Activity and Networking in Blood Bank Conditions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Proinflammatory mechanisms are implicated in pain states. Recent research indicates that osteoarthritis (OA) patients with signs of central sensitization exhibit elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). METHODS The current prospective cohort study, including 15 OA patients, primarily aimed to evaluate associations between alterations in CSF IP-10, Flt-1, MCP-1 and pain sensitization following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Participants provided CSF and blood samples for analysis of ten proinflammatory mediators, and underwent detailed clinical examination and quantitative sensory testing, immediately preoperative and 18-months after surgery. RESULTS Neurophysiological measures of pain showed markedly reduced pain sensitivity long-term postoperative. Increases in remote site pressure pain detection thresholds (PPDTs) and decreased temporal summation indicated partial resolution of previous central sensitization. Compared to preoperative, CSF concentrations of IP-10 were increased (P=0.041), whereas neither Flt-1 (P=0.112) nor MCP-1 levels changed (P=0.650). Compared to preoperative, plasma concentrations of IP-10 were increased (P=0.006), whereas interleukin (IL)-8 was decreased (P=0.023). Subjects who exhibited increases in arm PPDTs above median showed greater increases in CSF IP-10 compared to those with PPDT increases below median (P=0.028). Analyses of plasma IP-10 and IL-8 indicated higher levels of peripheral inflammation were linked to decreased pressure pain thresholds (unadjusted =-0.79, P=0.006, and =-118.1, P=0.014, respectively). CONCLUSIONS THA leads to long-term decreases in pain sensitivity, indicative of resolution of sensitization processes. Changes in CSF and plasma levels of IP-10, and plasma IL-8, may be associated with altered pain phenotype.","output":"Decreased Pain Sensitivity and Alterations of Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma Inflammatory Mediators After Total Hip Arthroplasty in Patients with Disabling Osteoarthritis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To reflect upon the concrete implications of the COVID-19 outbreak regarding ongoing health service and nursing management research (NMR) and to identify possible research priorities for the current and post-pandemic era.

Non pharmaceutical control interventions include government actions, public reactions, and other measures. The methodology consists of an empirical model, taking into consideration the generic framework of the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) EpidemicCMacroeconomic Model, and incorporates the effect of interventions through a multivalued parameter, a stepwise constant varying during different phases of the interventions designed to capture their impact on the model. The model is mathematically consistent and presents various simulation results using best-estimated parameter values. The model can be easily updated later in response to real-world alterations, for example, the easing of restrictions.

Practicability was defined as the correct use of the self-test and the correct interpretation of the result. The correct use of self-test was conditioned by the presence of the control band after 15-min of migration. The correct interpretation of the tests was defined by the percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results coded by the numbers and verified by trained observers. A total of 167 participants (52.7% female; median age, 35.8 years; 82% with post-graduate level) were enrolled, including 83 and 84 for usability and test results interpretation substudies, respectively. All participants (100%; 95% CI: 95.6-100) correctly used the self-test. However, 12 (14.5%; 95% CI: 8.5-23.6) asked for verbal help.

METHODS: We used pseudonymised data on 902 813 individuals employed by 191 National Health Service trusts to explore demographic and occupational risk factors for sickness absence ascribed to COVID-19 (n=92 880). We estimated ORs by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: With adjustment for employing trust, demographic characteristics and previous frequency of sickness absence, risk relative to administrative/clerical occupations was highest in additional clinical services (care assistants and other occupations directly supporting those in clinical roles) (OR 2.31 (2.25 to 2.37)), registered nursing and midwifery professionals (OR 2.28 (2.23 to 2.34)) and allied health professionals (OR 1.94 (1.88 to 2.01)) and intermediate in doctors and dentists (OR 1.55 (1.50 to 1.61)). Differences in risk were higher after the employing trust had started to care for documented patients with COVID-19, and were reduced, but not eliminated, following additional adjustment for exposure to infected patients or materials, assessed by a job-exposure matrix. For prolonged COVID-19 sickness absence (episodes lasting >14 days), the variation in risk by staff group was somewhat greater. CONCLUSIONS: After allowance for possible bias and confounding by non-occupational exposures, we estimated that relative risks for COVID-19 among most patient-facing occupations were between 1.5 and 2.5. The highest risks were in those working in additional clinical services, nursing and midwifery and in allied health professions. Better protective measures for these staff groups should be a priority. COVID-19 may meet criteria for compensation as an occupational disease in some healthcare occupations.

DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of 5 databases, and screening of eligible articles, from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We focused on quantitative and mixed-method studies that evaluated adolescent mental health literacy, appropriate package of services and provider competencies in mental health services, and that targeted depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder among adolescents (10-19 years). This included adolescents exposed to interventions or strategies within mental health services. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes for Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. Data were extracted and grouped based on WHO quality Standards. RESULTS: Of the 20 104 studies identified, 20 articles were included. The majority of studies came from high-income countries, with one from a low-income country. Most of the studies did not conceptualise quality. Results found that an online decision aid was evaluated to increase adolescent mental health literacy. Studies that targeted an appropriate package of services evaluated the quality of engagement between the therapist and adolescent, patient-centred communication, mental health service use, linkages to mental health services, health facility culture and intensive community treatment. Provider competencies focused on studies that evaluated confidence in managing and referring adolescents, collaboration between health facility levels, evidence-based practices and technology use.

We evaluated the potential for the pandemic to either mitigate or amplify widely acknowledged, pre-existing threats to freshwater fish biodiversity (i.e., invasive species, pollution, fragmentation, flow alteration, habitat loss and alteration, climate change, exploitation). Indeed, we identified examples spanning the extremes of positive and negative outcomes for almost all known threats. We also considered the pandemic's impact on freshwater fisheries demand, assessment, research, compliance monitoring, and management interventions (e.g., restoration), with disruptions being experienced in all domains. Importantly, we provide a forward-looking synthesis that considers the potential mechanisms and pathways by which the consequences of the pandemic may positively and negatively impact freshwater fishes over the longer term. We conclude with a candid assessment of the current management and policy responses and the extent to which they ensure freshwater fish populations and biodiversity are conserved for human and aquatic ecosystem benefits in perpetuity.","output":"A global perspective on the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on freshwater fish biodiversity.

We applied a precision public health strategy to syndromic surveillance for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Uganda by combining spatiotemporal analytics with genomic sequencing to detect and characterize viral respiratory pathogens with epidemic potential. METHODS: Using a national surveillance network we identified patients with unexplained, influenza-negative SARI from 2010 to 2015. Spatiotemporal analyses were performed retrospectively to identify clusters of unexplained SARI. Within clusters, respiratory viruses were detected and characterized in naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples using a novel oligonucleotide probe capture (VirCapSeq-VERT) and high-throughput sequencing platform. Linkage to conventional epidemiologic strategies further characterized transmission dynamics of identified pathogens. RESULTS: Among 2901 unexplained SARI cases, 9 clusters were detected, accounting for 301 (10.4%) cases. Clusters were more likely to occur in urban areas and during biannual rainy seasons. Within detected clusters, we identified an unrecognized outbreak of measles-associated SARI; sequence analysis implicated cocirculation of endemic genotype B3 and genotype D4 likely imported from England. We also detected a likely nosocomial SARI cluster associated with a novel picobirnavirus most closely related to swine and dromedary viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Using a precision approach to public health surveillance, we detected and characterized the genomics of vaccine-preventable and zoonotic respiratory viruses associated with clusters of severe respiratory infections in Uganda. Future studies are needed to assess the feasibility, scalability, and impact of applying similar approaches during real-time public health surveillance in low-income settings.","output":"Precision Surveillance for Viral Respiratory Pathogens: Virome Capture Sequencing for the Detection and Genomic Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection in Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: South Africa has a high degree of inequality between population groups. The first wave of COVID-19 may have affected people in lower socioeconomic groups worse than the affluent. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in South Africa is not known. Methods: We tested 405 volunteers representing all socioeconomic strata from the workforce of a popular shopping and tourist complex in central Cape Town with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. We assessed the association between antibody positivity and COVID-19 symptom status, medical history, and sociodemographic variables. We tested 137 serum samples from healthy controls collected in Cape Town prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to confirm the specificity of the assay in the local population. Results: Of the 405 volunteers tested one month after the first peak of the epidemic in Cape Town, 96(23.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Of those who tested positive, 46(47.9%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the previous 6 months. Seropositivity was significantly associated with living in informal housing, residing in a subdistrict with low income-per household, and having a low-earning occupation. The specificity of the assay was 98.54%(95%CI 94.82%-99.82%) in the pre-COVID controls. Conclusions: There is a high background seroprevalence in Cape Town, particularly in people of lower socioeconomic status.

The contributions of the implementation of air pollution prevention and control policies and the COVID-19 pandemic to major air pollutant emission reductions were studied, and their impacts on the regional air quality under adverse meteorological conditions were simulated using an air quality model. The results showed that from the 'New Year Haze' in Dec 2016-Jan 2017 to the 'Pandemic Haze' in Jan-Feb 2020, the major air pollutant emissions in the region had dropped by approximately 50%, and the average concentration of PM2.5 was potentially reduced by more than 40% under adverse meteorological conditions. The most effective emission reduction measures included the clean heating project and raising the standards in key industrial sectors, such as the iron and steel industry, coal-fired boilers, and power plants, which contributed 67.1% and 53.4% of the emission reductions in SO2 and PM2.5, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic predominantly affected the mobile sources and light industry, which contributed 71.9% and 68.2% of the emission reductions in NOx and VOCs, respectively. The implementation of air pollution prevention and control policies contributed substantially to the improvement of regional air quality, which effectively reduced the intensity and extent of the heavy pollution process under unfavorable meteorological conditions. The regional average PM2.5 concentration was reduced by 26%, and the number of days experiencing heavy pollution decreased by 44%. Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the average PM2.5 concentration in the region was reduced by an additional 24%, and the duration and extent of heavy pollution decreased even further.","output":"[Contributors to Air Pollutant Emission Changes in Autumn and Winter in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previously, we reported the establishment of cells with persistent SARS-CoV infection after apoptotic events and showed that both JNK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are important for persistence by treatment with inhibitors at the early stages of SARS-CoV infection.

In this study, we investigated which signaling pathways play important roles in escape from apoptosis in cells infected with SARS-CoV. In persistently infected cells at 50 h.p.i., PI3K/Akt, JNK, p38 MAPK and Bcl-2 were phosphorylated and the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were increased. When surviving cells were treated with the JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, at 50 h.p.i., all cells died, suggesting that the JNK signaling pathway is necessary for maintenance of persistently infected cells. Among the signaling pathways in persistently infected cells, Akt and JNK were phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-nucleocapsid (N) protein-expressing Vero E6 cells using vaccinia viral vector (DIs), strongly suggesting that N protein-induced phosphorylation of Akt and JNK are necessary to establish persistence.

There is less evidence on effectiveness in real-world settings, especially for older people. Here, we aimed to estimate vaccine effectiveness in the context of the rapid NHS mass-vaccination programme in England, exploiting age-based vaccination eligibility thresholds to minimise and correct for selection bias. METHODS: We studied 170,226 individuals between the ages of 80 and 83 years from community settings outside care homes who received one dose of BNT162b2 mRNA between the 15 and 20 December 2020 and were scheduled a second dose 21 days later. We matched these vaccine recipients to slightly younger (aged 76C79 years) persons not yet eligible to receive the vaccine on gender, area of residence, area deprivation, health status, living arrangements, acute illness, and history of seasonal flu vaccination. We compared their rates of COVID-19 positivity and hospitalisation in the subsequent 45 days. We adjusted for the increasing concentration of COVID-19 positivity in the control population caused by the requirement to have no COVID-19 symptoms prior to vaccination. RESULTS: Emergency hospital admissions were 51.0% (95% confidence interval 19.9 to 69.5%) lower and positive COVID-19 tests were 55.2% (40.8 to 66.8%) lower for vaccinated individuals compared to matched controls 21 to 27 days after first vaccination. Emergency admissions were 75.6% (52.8 to 87.6%) lower, and positive COVID-19 tests were 70.1% (55.1 to 80.1%) lower 35 to 41 days after first vaccination when 79% of participants had received a second dose within 26 days of their first dose.

Methods: This multicenter observational study aimed to determine antibody kinetics among 60 seropositive KTRs and analyzed the effects of the third vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in 174 previously seronegative KTRs. We investigated whether mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dose reduction by 25-50% prior the third vaccination influences vaccination success. Results: 18 of 60 (30%) seropositive KTRs became seronegative in the serological assay within six months. Loss of antibodies was predicted by low initial antibody levels (<[]>206.8 BAU/ml), older age, and impaired graft function. A third vaccination in previously seronegative KTRs induced seroconversion in 56 of 174 (32.1%) KTRs with median antibody levels 119 (76-353) BAU/ml and median neutralizing capacity titer of 1:10 (0-1:40). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that initial antibody levels (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.76), graft function (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.39), time after transplantation (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07) and MMF trough levels (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88) correlated with seroconversion, p<0.05. After controlling for these confounders, the effect of MMF dose reduction was calculated using propensity score matching. KTRs in the MMF reduction group had significantly lower MMF serum concentrations prior to the third vaccination and were more likely to develop antibody levels <[]>35.2 BAU/ml than their matched KTRs (p=0.02). Conclusions: Temporary reduction in MMF dose might be a promising approach to improve the immune response in KTRs.","output":"Immune response to third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in seronegative kidney transplant recipients: possible improvement by mycophenolate mofetil reduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explore the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on premature birth rates in Denmark, a nationwide register-based prevalence proportion study was conducted on all 31 180 live singleton infants born in Denmark between 12 March and 14 April during 2015C2020.

The uncertainty created by COVID-19 makes it is difficult for various industries to deal with the pandemic. Since the pandemic, the supply chain's resilience has been discussed and examined in some studies. However, most existing works start from a single industry perspective or pay more attention to the disturbance caused by changes in the production side. Supply chain networks of different industries, mainly transport networks, are relatively limited under the epidemic's impact. In this paper, from the perspective of highway freight transport, a comprehensive competitiveness evaluation framework was proposed to reveal and the disruption and resilience of the supply chain under the outbreak based on nine indexes with five dimensions, including efficiency, capacity, activity, connectivity, and negotiability. Based on the availability of the data(Large-scale truck trajectory), we sorted out seven categories of Chinese industries(related to highway transport) and divided them into four categories respectively: (a) Slight disruption and worse resilience; (b) Slight disruption and remarkable resilience; (c) Serious disruption and worse resilience; (d) Serious disruption and remarkable resilience. The measurement results of supply chain network performance show that the industries (cold-chain, general products, and other industries) dominated by Efficiency - Negotiability - Connectivity are slightly disrupted (about 33%), forming a spatial diffusion with Wuhan(the city where the pandemic first broke out) as the disrupted center, spreading outward in a circle structure. Simultaneously, five urban agglomerations surrounding it have been impacted. By contrast, due to the strict isolation measures, the industries (building materials, construction, engineering, and high-value products industry) more vulnerable to be disrupted seriously (about 82%) tend to be the pattern of Capacity - Activity. However, a large-scale centralized disruption was observed in the Triangle of Central China urban agglomeration was presented, resulting in almost stagnation of industry development.

For use in mission-critical and safety-critical applications, however, it is important to be able to analyze what a neural network can and cannot do. For feed-forward neural networks with ReLU activation functions, although exact analysis is NP-complete, recently-proposed verification methods can sometimes succeed. The main practical problem with neural network verification is excessive analysis runtime. Even on small networks, tools that are theoretically complete can sometimes run for days without producing a result. In this paper, we work to address the runtime problem by improving upon a recently-proposed geometric path enumeration method. Through a series of optimizations, several of which are new algorithmic improvements, we demonstrate significant speed improvement of exact analysis on the well-studied ACAS Xu benchmarks, sometimes hundreds of times faster than the original implementation. On more difficult benchmark instances, our optimized approach is often the fastest, even outperforming inexact methods that leverage overapproximation and refinement.","output":"Improved Geometric Path Enumeration for Verifying ReLU Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Administration of ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener levcromakalim triggers headache in healthy volunteers and migraine attacks in migraine patients. Here, we investigated the effect of ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker glibenclamide on levcromakalim-induced headache in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study, 15 healthy volunteers aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to receive glibenclamide and levcromakalim (day 1), glibenclamide and placebo (day 2), and placebo and placebo (day 3) on three different days separated by at least 1 week. The primary endpoints were the difference in incidence of headache and the difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores (0-12 hours) between the days. RESULTS: Fifteen healthy volunteers completed the 3 days of the study. More participants (12/15, 80%) developed headache on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (5/15, 33%) (p = 0.01; mean difference 47%; 95% confidence interval 18-75%) and compared to the placebo-placebo day (1/15, 7%) (p = 0.001; mean difference 73%; 95% confidence interval 48-99%). We found no difference in headache incidence between glibenclamide-placebo day and placebo-placebo day (p = 0.12; mean difference 27%; 95% confidence interval 1.3-52%). The area under the curve for headache intensity was significantly larger on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (p = 0.003); and compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.001). We found no difference in the area under the curve between the glibenclamide-placebo day compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.07). The median time to onset for headache after levcromakalim infusion with glibenclamide pretreatment was delayed (180 min) compared to levcromakalim without pretreatment (30 min) from a previously published study. CONCLUSION: Glibenclamide administration did not cause headache, and glibenclamide pretreatment did not prevent levcromakalim-induced headache.

However, information on the rate of outbreak occurrences which helps to identify the type of workplaces that are more likely to experience an outbreak, or infection attack rates which estimates the potential extent of the virus transmission in an outbreak, has not yet been available to inform intervention strategies to limit transmission . Objectives: To link datasets on workplace settings and COVID-19 workplace outbreaks in England in order to: identify the geographical areas and workplace sectors with a high rate of outbreaks; and compare infection attack rates by workplace size and sector. Methods: We analysed Public Health England (PHE) HPZone data on COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces, covering the time period of 18 May - 12 October 2020. The workplaces analysed excluded care homes, hospitals and educational settings. We calculated the workplace outbreak rates by nine English regions, 151 Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs) and twelve industrial sectors, using National Population Database (NPD) data extracted in May 2019 on the total number of the relevant workplaces as the denominator. We also calculated the infection attack rates by enterprise size (small, medium, large) and industrial sector, using PHE Situations of Interest (SOI) data on the number of test-confirmed COVID-19 cases in a workplace outbreak as the numerator, and using NPD data on the number employed in that workplace as the denominator. Results: In total, 1,317 confirmed workplace outbreaks were identified from HPZone data, of which 1,305 were available for estimation of outbreak rates. The average outbreak rate was 66 per 100,000 workplaces. Of the nine geographical regions in England, the North West had the highest workplace outbreak rate (155/100,000 workplaces), based on 351 outbreaks. Of the UTLAs, the highest workplace outbreak rate was Blackburn with Darwen (387/100,000 workplaces). The industrial sector with the highest workplace outbreak rate was manufacturers and packers of food (1,672/100,000), based on 117 outbreaks: this was consistent across seven of the regions. In addition, high outbreak rates in warehouses were observed in the East Midlands and the North West. In total, 390 outbreaks were identified from SOI data and 264 of them allowed for estimation of attack rates. The overall median attack rate was 3.4% of the employed persons with confirmed COVID-19 at a workplace with an outbreak. Most of these outbreaks (162) had an attack rate less than 6%. However, in a small number of outbreaks (57) the attack rate was over 15%. The attack rates increased as the size of the enterprise decreased. The highest attack rate was for outbreaks in close contact services (median 16.5%), which was followed by outbreaks in restaurants and catering (median 10.2%), and in manufacturers and packers of non-food products (median 6.7%). Conclusions: Our linked dataset analysis approach allows early identification of geographical regions and industrial sectors with higher rates of COVID-19 workplace outbreaks as well as estimation of attack rates by enterprise size and sector. This can be used to inform interventions to limit transmission of the virus. Our approach to analysing the workplace outbreak data can also be applied to calculation of outbreak rates and attack rates in other types of settings such as care homes, hospitals and educational settings.","output":"COVID-19 outbreak rates and infection attack rates associated with the workplace: a descriptive epidemiological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cellular cyclophilins (Cyps) such as cyclophilin A (CypA) have emerged as key players at the virus-host interface. As host factors required for the replication of many unrelated viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and coronaviruses (CoVs), Cyps are attractive targets for antiviral therapy. However, a clear understanding of how these viruses exploit Cyps to promote their replication has yet to be elucidated. Recent findings suggest that CypA contributes to cloaking of viral replication intermediates, an evasion strategy that prevents detection of viral nucleic acid by innate immune sensors. Furthermore, Cyps are emerging to have roles in regulation of cellular antiviral signaling pathways. Recruitment of Cyps by viral proteins may interfere with their ability to regulate these signaling factors. Consistent with disruption of viral cloaking and innate immune evasion, treatment with Cyp inhibitors such as cyclosporine A (CsA) restores antiviral innate immunity and induces expression of a subset of antiviral genes that restrict viral infection, which may help to explain the broad antiviral spectrum of CsA. In this review, we provide an overview of the roles of CypA in viral cloaking and evasion of innate immunity, focusing on the underlying mechanisms and new perspectives for antiviral therapies.","output":"Emerging Roles of Cyclophilin A in Regulating Viral Cloaking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Misinformation is one of the greatest threats to global health.

In 2017-18, a survey was distributed to medical students and residents at two accredited medical schools. Participants noted preferred styles of learning regarding lecture duration, timing, location, format, third-party resources, learner types and USMLE Step 1 scores. The 'Learning Environment, Learning Processes, and Learning Outcomes' (LEPO) framework [5] was used to examine learner preferences, with responses compared using the Mann-Whitney U and two proportion z-tests. A total of 329 respondents completed the survey: 62.7% medical students and 37.3% residents. The majority of participants identified their learning style by Kolb [6] as converging (33.0%) or accommodating (39.2%). Students preferred lectures 30-40 minutes long (43.3%), during morning hours (54.2%), in their own homes (52.0%), via online lectures with simultaneous drawings (56.0%), and classroom/podcast lectures with PowerPoint? presentations (54.3%).

Nevertheless, data are lacking about the determinants of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the combined effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and AKI in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected data on patient demographics, comorbidities, chronic medications, vital signs, baseline laboratory test results and in-hospital treatment in patients with COVID-19 consecutively admitted to our Institution. Chronic kidney disease was defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or proteinuria at urinalysis within 180 days prior to hospital admission. AKI was defined according to KDIGO criteria. The primary and secondary outcomes were the development of AKI and death. RESULTS: Of 777 patients eligible for the study, acute kidney injury developed in 176 (22.6%). Of these, 79 (45%) showed an acute worsening of a preexisting CKD, and 21 (12%) required kidney replacement therapy. Independent associates of AKI were chronic kidney disease, C-reactive protein (CRP) and ventilation support. Among patients with acute kidney injury, 111 died (63%) and its occurrence increased the risk of death by 60% (HR 1.60 [95% IC 1.21C2.49] p = 0.002) independently of potential confounding factors including hypertension, preexisting kidney damage, and comorbidities.

Anecdotally, researchers have described delays and substantial inter-provincial variations in the timeliness of data access approvals and receipt of data. Currently, the reasons for these delays and variations in timeliness are not well understood. This paper provides a study protocol for (1) identifying the factors affecting access to administrative health data for research within select Canadian provinces, and (2) comparing factors across provinces to assess whether and how they contribute to inter-provincial variations in access to administrative health data for research. METHODS: A qualitative, multiple-case study research design will be used. Three cases will be included, representing three different provinces. For each case, data will be collected from documents and interviews. Specifically, interviews will be carried out with (1) research stakeholders, and (2) regulatory stakeholders (10 individuals/group * 2 groups/province * 3 provinces = 60). During within-case analysis, interview data for each stakeholder group will be analyzed separately using constant comparative analysis. Document analysis will occur iteratively, and will inform interview guide adaptation, and supplement interview data. Cross-case analysis will involve systematic comparison of findings across cases. DISCUSSION: This study represents the first in-depth examination of access to administrative health data in Canada. The main outcome will be an overarching mid-range theory explaining inter-provincial variations in access to administrative health data in Canada. This theory will be strengthened by the inclusion of the perspectives of both researchers and those involved in the regulation of data access.

However, participatory, evidence-informed decision-making processes to identify and weigh these factors are often not possible- especially, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While evidence-to-decision frameworks are not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, they can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered. OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges of decision-making on non-pharmacological interventions to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We employed the best fit framework synthesis technique and used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework as a starting point. First, we adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to case studies. Next, we conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide policymakers on the phasing out of applied lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we developed the WICID (WHO-INTEGRATE COVID-19) framework version 1.0. RESULTS: Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were analysed. The revised framework consists of 11+1 criteria, supported by 48 aspects, and embraces a complex systems perspective. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental human rights, acceptability and equity considerations, societal, environmental and economic implications, as well as implementation, resource and feasibility considerations.

The PERV envelope glycoprotein has also been proposed as a possible swine syncytin with a role in placental development. Despite the growing interest in PERVs, their envelope glycoproteins remain poorly characterized. Here, we successfully determined the postfusion crystal structure of the PERV core fusion ectodomain. The PERV fusion protein structure reveals a conserved class I viral fusion protein six-helix bundle. Biophysical experiments demonstrated that the thermodynamic stability of the PERV fusion protein secondary structure was the same at physiological and acidic pHs. A conserved surface analysis highlights the high degree of sequence conservation among retroviral fusogens in the chain reversal region that facilitates the large-scale conformational change required for membrane fusion. Further structural alignment of class I viral fusogens revealed a phylogenetic clustering that shows evolution into various lineages that correlate with virus mechanisms of cell entry.

Much effort has focused on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-type compartment models. These models consider host populations and measure change of each compartment. In this study, we propose an alternative patch dynamic modeling framework from pathogens' perspective. Each patch, the basic module of this modeling framework, has four standard mechanisms of pathogen population size change: birth (replication), death, inflow, and outflow. This framework naturally distinguishes between-host transmission process (inflow and outflow) and within-host infection process (replication) during the entire transmission-infection cycle. We demonstrate that the SIR-type model is actually a special cross-sectional and discretized case of our patch dynamics model in pathogens' viewpoint. In addition, this patch dynamics modeling framework is also an agent-based model from hosts' perspective by incorporating individual host's specific traits. We provide an operational standard to formulate this modular-designed patch dynamics model. Model parameterization is feasible with a wide range of sources, including genomics data, surveillance data, electronic health record, and from other emerging technologies such as multiomics.

This international qualitative study captured the global impact on vascular patient care during the first pandemic wave. METHODS: An online structured survey was used to collect regular unit-level data regarding the modification to a wide range of vascular services and treatment pathways on a global scale. RESULTS: The survey commenced on 23rd March 2020 worldwide. Over six weeks, 249 vascular units took part in 53 countries (465 individual responses). Overall, 65% of units stopped carotid surgery for anyone except patients with crescendo symptoms or offered surgery on a case-by-case basis, 25% only intervened for symptomatic aortic aneurysms cancelling all elective repairs. For patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease 60% of units moved to an endovascular-first strategy. For patients who had previously undergone endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, 31.8% of units stopped all postoperative surveillance. Of those units regularly engaging in multidisciplinary team meetings, 59.5% of units stopped regular meetings and 39.1% had not replaced them. Further, 20% of units did not have formal personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines in place and 25% reported insufficient PPE availability.

Aims: Evaluate the resources available and used to gather COVID-19 epidemiological data by Portuguese health authorities from the onset of the pandemic until December 2020. The analysis laid on two main topics: (a) work processes at the Public Health Unit (PHU) level and (b) registry forms for epidemiological reporting and control procedures. Recommendations on requirements to overcome problems related to data integration and interoperability in order to build robust decision-making support mechanisms will also be produced. Methods: For topic (a), we revised the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health (DGS) guidelines for data treatment. For topic (b), we analysed the forms used during first and second waves, while comparing them with DGS metadata provided to researchers. Results: On topic (a), we detected the use of two complementary and non-interoperable systems. Further, the workflow does not seem to promote data quality and facilitates the occurrence of communication problems between health professionals. On topic (b), we found 27 deleted questions, 6 new questions, 1 displaced question, and 1 text modification between the 2 form versions. Discussion: Both the workflow and data gathering methods are not the best suited for the generation of good quality data. They do not effectively support Public Health Professionals (PHP) nor provide the elements for posterior data analysis. The use of data by decision-making support mechanisms demands a careful planning of the data used to depict reality, and this condition is not met by the currently used forms. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"A Cautionary Tale on Using Covid-19 Data for Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heightened stress, school closures, loss of income, and social isolation resulting from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have increased the risk for child abuse and neglect (1). Using National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) data from January 6, 2019-September 6, 2020, CDC tabulated weekly numbers of emergency department (ED) visits related to child abuse and neglect and calculated the proportions of such visits per 100,000 ED visits, as well as the percentage of suspected or confirmed ED visits related to child abuse and neglect ending in hospitalization, overall and stratified by age group (0-4, 5-11, and 12-17 years). The total number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect began decreasing below the corresponding 2019 period during week 11 (March 15-March 22, 2020) for all age groups examined, coinciding with the declaration of a national emergency on March 13 (2); simultaneously, the proportion of these visits per 100,000 ED visits began increasing above the 2019 baseline for all age groups. Despite decreases in the weekly number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect, the weekly number of these visits resulting in hospitalization remained stable in 2020; however, the yearly percentage of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect resulting in hospitalization increased significantly among all age groups. Although the increased proportion of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect might be associated with a decrease in the overall number of ED visits, these findings also suggest that health care-seeking patterns have shifted during the pandemic. Hospitalizations for child abuse and neglect did not decrease in 2020, suggesting that injury severity did not decrease during the pandemic, despite decreased ED visits.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of oral semaglutide 14 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes from a healthcare payer perspective in Portugal. METHODS: In two separate analyses, outcomes were projected over patients lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (v9.0), discounted at 4% per annum. Clinical data were sourced from the PIONEER 2 trial and the NMA for the comparisons versus empagliflozin and dulaglutide, respectively. Patients were assumed to receive initial therapies until HbA1c exceeded 7.5%, then treatment-intensified to solely basal insulin therapy. Costs were accounted from a National Healthcare Service perspective in Portugal and expressed in 2021 euros (EUR). Utilities were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Oral semaglutide 14 mg was associated with improvements in life expectancy of 0.10 and 0.03 years, and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.11 and 0.03 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), versus empagliflozin 25 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg, respectively. Improved clinical outcomes were due to a reduced cumulative incidence and increased time to onset of diabetes-related complications with oral semaglutide. Total costs were projected to be EUR 2548 and EUR 814 higher with oral semaglutide versus empagliflozin and dulaglutide, with higher acquisition costs partially offset by cost savings from avoidance of diabetes-related complications. Oral semaglutide 14 mg was therefore associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of EUR 23,571 and EUR 23,927 per QALY gained versus empagliflozin 25 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 30,000 per QALY gained, oral semaglutide 14 mg was considered cost-effective versus empagliflozin 25 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Portugal.","output":"The long-term cost-effectiveness of oral semaglutide versus empagliflozin and dulaglutide in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Graves' disease is an autoimmune thyroid disease that is thought to develop following environmental exposure in patients with genetic predisposition. Our objective is to present the first report of Graves' disease onset immediately following recovery from mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a close temporal occurrence that should be studied further. Methods: We describe the clinical course and laboratory features, including thyroid function studies, antibody testing, and polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Results: A 21-year-old woman with prediabetes, obesity, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented to the emergency department reporting 3 days of tachycardia, palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. Laboratory investigation revealed a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 (0.30-5.00) mcIU/mL with a free thyroxine level of 3.8 (0.6-1.6) ng/dL, prompting endocrinology consultation. On physical examination, she had mild diffuse thyromegaly without tenderness and a history, which included hypothyroidism in her mother. Antibody testing results demonstrated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin and thyrotropin receptor antibody levels of 2.6 (<1.3) thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin index and 17 (0.00-1.75) IU/L, respectively. Sixteen days before presenting to the ED, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction test after reporting typical symptoms, including fever. Infectious symptoms resolved within 10 days. She achieved clinical and laboratory improvements with a combination of methimazole and beta blocker therapy. Conclusion: This case documents the occurrence of Graves' thyrotoxicosis following mild symptomatic COVID-19.

A total of 1523 patients with a current or past diagnosis of solid tumors and diagnosed with COVID-19 (confirmed with PCR) between 11 March and 20 May, 2020, were included. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Median age was 61 (range:18-94), and 752 (49%) were male. The most common types of cancers were breast (19.8%), prostate (10.9%), and colorectal cancer (10.8%). 65% of the patients had at least one comorbidity. At least one Covid-19 directed therapy was given in 73% of the patients.. Hospitalization rate of the patients was 56.6% and intensive care unit admission rate was 11.4%. 77 (5.1%) patients died within 30 days of diagnosis. The first multivariate model which included only the demographic and clinical characteristics showed older age, male gender, and presence of diabetes and receipt of cytotoxic therapy to be associated with increased 30-day mortality, while breast and prostate cancer diagnoses were associated with lower 30-day mortality.

The effect of physical restraints on outcomes of critically ill adults remains controversial as no randomized controlled trials have compared its safety and efficacy, and the association between physical restraint requirement and neurological outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has not been fully examined. The aim of this study was to examine the association between physical restraint requirement and neurological outcomes in patients with SAH. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study was conducted on patients with acute phase SAH treated for > 72 h in the intensive care unit from 2014 to 2020. Patients were divided into three groups based on the amount of time required for physical restraint during the first 24C72 h after admission: no, intermittent, and continuous use of physical restraint. Unfavorable neurologic outcome, assessed using the modified Rankin scale upon hospital discharge, has been considered as primary end point. RESULTS: Overall, 101 patients were included in the study, with 52 patients (51.5%) having unfavorable neurological outcomes. Among them, 46 patients (45.5%) did not use physical restraint, and 55 (54.5%) patients used physical restraint during the first 24C72 h after admission: 26 (25.7%) intermittent and 29 (28.7%) continuous. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that continuous use of physical restraint during the first 24C72 h after admission was significantly associated with unfavorable neurological outcomes in patients with SAH (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.05C13.06; p = 0.042) compared with no physical restraint. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous use of physical restraint during the first 24C72 h after admission was more significantly associated with unfavorable neurological outcomes than no physical restraint among patients with SAH during the acute phase.

The aim of this prospective study is to characterize the level of consciousness in patients undergoing PS using Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring. PATIENTS AND METHODS We enrolled consecutive patients with refractory symptoms requiring PS. We documented the level of sedation using Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) and BIS at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h during the first day of PS and examined their degree of association. Intravenous midazolam or propofol was titrated according to the sedation level. RESULTS Twenty patients on PS were recruited and had BIS continuous monitoring. Delirium was the most frequent reason for PS (n = 15, 75%). The median time of sedation was 24.5 h (interquartile range 6-46). The average time to achieve the desired sedation level was 6 h, and dose titration was required in 80% of the cases. At baseline, 14 (70%) patients were considered to be awake according to RSS (i.e., 1-3) and 19 (95%) were awake according to BIS (i.e., >60%). This proportion decreased to 31 and 56% at 4 h, 27% and 53 at 6 h, and 22 and 33% at 24 h. RS and BIS had moderate correlation (rho = -0.58 to -0.65); however, a small proportion of patients were found to be awake by BIS (i.e., 60%) despite clinical observation (i.e., RSS 4-6) indicating otherwise.

Some secondary metabolites induce autophagy and mediate autophagy-dependent healthspan- and lifespan-extending effects in suitable mouse models. Here, we identified isobacachalcone (ISO) as a non-toxic inducer of autophagic flux that acts on human and mouse cells in vitro, as well as mouse organs in vivo. Mechanistically, ISO inhibits AKT as well as, downstream of AKT, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), coupled to the activation of the pro-autophagic transcription factors EB (TFEB) and E3 (TFE3). Cells equipped with a constitutively active AKT mutant failed to activate autophagy. ISO also stimulated the AKT-repressible activation of all three arms of the unfolded stress response (UPR), including the PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Knockout of TFEB and/or TFE3 blunted the UPR, while knockout of PERK or replacement of eIF2 by a non-phosphorylable mutant reduced TFEB/TFE3 activation and autophagy induced by ISO. This points to crosstalk between the UPR and autophagy. Of note, the administration of ISO to mice improved the efficacy of immunogenic anticancer chemotherapy. This effect relied on an improved T lymphocyte-dependent anticancer immune response and was lost upon constitutive AKT activation in, or deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg5 from, the malignant cells.

In the present study, a WE43 Mg alloy with a plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO)-generated surface was investigated. Surface microstructure, hydrogen gas evolution in immersion tests and cytocompatibility were assessed. In addition, a novel in vitro immunological test using primary human lymphocytes was introduced. On PEO-treated WE43, a larger number of pores and microcracks, as well as increased roughness, were observed compared to untreated WE43. Hydrogen gas evolution after two weeks was reduced by 40.7% through PEO treatment, indicating a significantly reduced corrosion rate. In contrast to untreated WE43, PEO-treated WE43 exhibited excellent cytocompatibility. After incubation for three days, untreated WE43 killed over 90% of lymphocytes while more than 80% of the cells were still vital after incubation with the PEO-treated WE43. PEO-treated WE43 slightly stimulated the activation, proliferation and toxin (perforin and granzyme B) expression of CD8(+) T cells.

The need for dose adjustment following bariatric surgery was examined, as well as the potential for extrapolation to other drugs subjected to coinciding pharmacokinetic mechanisms. A total of 22 original articles and 32 different drugs were assessed. The majority of available data is based on Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) (18 of 22 studies), and hence, the overall interpretation is more or less limited to RYGBP. In the case of the majority of studied drugs, an increased absorption rate was observed early after RYGBP. The effect on systemic exposure allows for a low degree of extrapolation, including between drugs subjected to the same major metabolic and transporter pathways. On the basis of current understanding, predicting the pharmacokinetic change for a specific drug following RYGBP is challenging.

These goals were achieved by > 80% of students and PDs. Overall, 79% of students and 78% of PDs rated the vSIU excellent or very good. On multivariable ordinal logistic regression, duration  3 weeks and class size  4 students were associated with higher student ratings (p <0.05). Full-time electives, class size  4 students, and utilization of the SAU guidebook were associated with higher PD ratings (p <0.05). Although the majority of respondents found the vSIU less effective overall than in-person subinternships, 46% of students and 66% of PDs recommended incorporating virtual components into future electives. CONCLUSIONS: Amid a global pandemic, the vSIU was a successful nationwide initiative to provide virtual urological education to medical students. Though the vSIU should not replace in-person subinternships, the electives were highly rated and achieved the most important goals for students and PDs. The most successful courses were full-time, longer, had smaller class sizes and utilized the SAU Guidebook.","output":"National implementation of a virtual subinternship in urology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly affected healthcare delivery across the world. In this report, we aim to further characterize the changes in cardiac catheterization at our institution, specifically in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization between December 23, 2019 and April 12, 2020 at our institution. All patients with cardiac catheterizations for ACS, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) activation, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) were analyzed. Cardiac catheterization volume, as well as clinical and procedural characteristics of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, was compared before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Patients presenting with ACS and OHCA were similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities during both time periods. The mean monthly volume for ACS cases dropped by 26% during the pandemic, which was consistent among both unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and STEMI cases. OHCA volume decreased significantly as well (five cases per month before to zero cases during the pandemic, P = 0.01). Among patients with STEMI, initial markers of cardiac injury, door-to-balloon time, and all-cause mortality were similar in both time periods. Conclusions: With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in cardiac catheterization volume across the spectrum of ACS at our institution, which was consistent with reports from other centers across the globe.

Although hippocampus activity is believed to be affected by socioeconomic status (SES), limited knowledge exists on which SES indicators influence hippocampus function. Purpose: This study explored the separate and combined effects of three SES indicators, namely parental education, family income, and neighborhood income, on adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. As some of the effects of parental education may be through income, we also tested if the effect of parental education on hippocampus activation during our N-Back memory task is mediated by family or neighborhood income. Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study is a national multi-center investigation of American adolescents' brain development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of a total sample of 3067 9-10-year-old adolescents were used. The primary outcome was left- hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task (mean beta weight for N-Back run 1 2 back versus 0 back contrast in left hippocampus). The independent variable was parental education. Family income and neighborhood income were two possible mediators. Age, sex, and marital status were the covariates. To test mediation, we used hierarchical linear regression models first without and then with our mediators. Full mediation was defined according to Kenny. The Sobel test was used to confirm statistical mediation. Results: In the absence of family and neighborhood income in the model, higher parental educational attainment was associated with lower level of left hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. This effect was significant while age, sex, and marital status were controlled. The association between parental educational attainment and hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task was no more significant when we controlled for family and neighborhood income. Instead, family income was associated with hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. These findings suggested that family income fully mediates the effect of parental educational attainment on left hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. Conclusions: The effect of parental educational attainment on adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task is fully explained by family income. That means low family income is why adolescents with low-educated parents show highlighted hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. Given the central role of the hippocampus in learning and memory and as income is a modifiable factor by tax and economic policies, income-redistribution policies, fair taxation, and higher minimum wage may have implications for promotion of adolescent equality and social justice. There is a need to focus on family-level economic needs across all levels of neighborhood income.","output":"Family Income Mediates the Effect of Parental Education on Adolescents' Hippocampus Activation During an N-Back Memory Task"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The main aim of the study was to describe self-reported symptoms of COVID-19 and examine if long-term symptoms are associated with lifestyle factors or common chronic diseases among Swedish young adults. A secondary aim was to compare the prevalence of smoking and snuff use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study population includes 1644 participants aged 23-26 years from the Swedish population-based birth cohort BAMSE. From August to November 2020, the participants answered a web questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms, lifestyle and health. Information on tobacco use was compared against the previous study follow-up in 2016-2019. RESULTS: The prevalence of suspected COVID-19 symptoms was 45.3% (n=742), and 80 of these (10.8%) reported long-term symptoms (a4 weeks). There was no significant difference in sociodemographic or lifestyle factors in relation to the duration of suspected COVID-19 symptoms.

Hospitals become rapidly overwhelmed when patients requiring life-saving support outpace available capacities. We here describe methods used by a university hospital to forecast caseloads and time to peak incidence. METHODS: We developed a set of models to forecast incidence among the hospital catchment population and describe the COVID-19 patient hospital care-path. The first forecast utilized data from antecedent allopatric epidemics and parameterized the care path model according to expert opinion (static model). Once sufficient local data were available, trends for the time dependent effective reproduction number were fitted and the care-path was re-parameterized using hazards for real patient admission, referrals, and discharge (dynamic model). RESULTS: The static model, deployed before the epidemic, exaggerated the bed occupancy (general wards 116 forecasted vs 66 observed, ICU 47 forecasted vs 34 observed) and predicted the peak too late (general ward forecast April 9, observed April 8, ICU forecast April 19, observed April 8). After April 5, the dynamic model could be run daily and precision improved with increasing availability of empirical local data. CONCLUSIONS: The models provided data-based guidance in the preparation and allocation of critical resources of a university hospital well in advance of the epidemic surge, despite overestimating the service demand.

A huge number of new patients, a fast internal reorganization process and many other changes were suddenly established. These circumstances revealed the need to increase stocks of drugs, both for basic treatment as well as for specific SARS-CoV-2 infection management. At the same time, other problems (shortages, new and complex purchasing procedures, etc.) surfaced, so they could risk safety along the pharmacotherapeutic process. The main objective was to develop and implement all the necessary measures within the logistics circuit in order to ensure the availability of medicines for patients, as safely and effectively as possible, during the Coronavirus crisis. Firstly, two pharmacists were appointed to coordinate the whole process, and a preliminary analysis of the following aspects was carried out an estimation of needs to make an initial drug provisioning, a storage feasibility study and a global analysis of the logistics process to detect critical points. Three different circuits for medicines supply were established as some drugs were operated by Agencia Espa?ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) or Servicio Madrile?o de Salud (SERMAS), and others were under no restrictions. For stocks control, inventory was frequently reviewed and monitoring of prescription trends was implemented. For all new medicinal products, compliance with security standards was reviewed and relabeling was carried out if necessary. Criteria were defined for the storage of overstocks and it was placed an isolated area for quarantined drugs. Shortages inevitably occurred but their effects were partly mitigated by AEMPS and SERMAS. After all, we consider that the implemented procedure for logistics management may be reproducible, and the key points we have identified are the following: to enhance our quality management system, to develop an Action Plan for Healthcare Emergencies and to ensure the adequate training for all pharmacy staff.

The in silico prophage analysis of 164 genomes of B. subtilis strains revealed that 75.00% of them contained intact prophages that exist as integrated and/or plasmid forms. Comparative genomics revealed the rich diversity of the prophages distributed in 13 main clusters and four distinct singletons. The analysis of the putative prophage proteins indicated the involvement of prophages in encoding the proteins linked to the immunity, bacteriocin production, sporulation, arsenate, and arsenite resistance of the host, enhancing its adaptability to diverse environments. An induction study in 91 B. subtilis collections demonstrated that UV-light treatment was instrumental in producing infective phages in 18.68% of them, showing a wide range of host specificity. The high prevalence and inducibility potential of the prophages observed in this study implies that prophages may play vital roles in the B. subtilis host.","output":"Prevalence, Diversity and UV-Light Inducibility Potential of Prophages in Bacillus subtilis and Their Possible Roles in Host Properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current COVID-19 pandemic, evidence to justify the use of any specific antiviral drug with proven efficacy is not yet available.

It is necessary to define the hybridization properties of these latter probes in order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of oligonucleotide microarray-based mutational analysis of disease-related genes. Here, we compare and contrast the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide microarrays consisting of 25mer probes complementary to all possible single nucleotide substitutions and insertions, and one and two base deletions in the 9168 bp coding region of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene. Over 68 different dye-labeled single-stranded nucleic acid targets representing all ATM coding exons were applied to these microarrays. We assess hybridization specificity by comparing the relative hybridization signals from probes perfectly matched to ATM sequences to those containing mismatches. Probes complementary to two base substitutions displayed the highest average specificity followed by those complementary to single base substitutions, single base deletions and single base insertions. In all the cases, hybridization specificity was strongly influenced by sequence context and possible intra- and intermolecular probe and/or target structure. Furthermore, single nucleotide substitution probes displayed the most consistent hybridization specificity data followed by single base deletions, two base deletions and single nucleotide insertions. Overall, these studies provide valuable empirical data that can be used to more accurately model the hybridization properties of insertion and deletion probes and improve the design and interpretation of oligonucleotide microarray-based resequencing and mutational analysis.","output":"Comparisons of substitution, insertion and deletion probes for resequencing and mutational analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fabella is a sesamoid bone of knee that has potential biomechanical function. We aimed to examine the fabellar prevalence and parameters in Chinese population and test the hypothesis that fabellar presence and morphology were associated with meniscus tear or ligament injury. METHODS: A total of 1011 knee magnetic resonance imaging scans from 979 patients with knee pain were analyzed retrospectively. The exclusion criteria are postsurgical scans, difficulty in fabella discrimination, conditions not suitable for measurement, and unsatisfied image. The fabellar presence and its parameters (length, width and thickness) were documented. The association between fabellar presence and meniscus tear or ligament injury were assessed by chi-square test, in all knees and subgroups (age, gender, side, lesion part). The correlation of fabellar presence and parameters with advancing age was assessed by Spearman correlation analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to investigate whether factors related with meniscus tear or ligament injury. Diagnostic performance of risk factors was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of fabellae was 39.8% (402/1011 knees) and increased with the increasing age (r = 0.237, P < 0.001). The size of the fabellae differed according to genders, age, and presence of articulating grooves. Fabella presented more often in knees with medial meniscus (MM) tears (66.7% vs 33.8%; P < 0.001) with a multivariate OR of 2.960 (95% CI, 1.853-3.903). The association remained in all tear parts (anterior, middle, and posterior), and in younger (age < 50 years) and older patients (age  50 years). Age, fabellar length, width, length/thickness ratio and width/thickness ratio yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.604-0.766 to predict an MM tear. In combination with age, fabellar width and length/thickness ratio, the AUC was improved 0.791 (95% CI, 0.744-0.837), with a sensitivity of 73.0% and a specificity of 74.6%. CONCLUSION: The presence of fabellae, increased fabellar length and width as well as flatter fabellar morphology, are significantly associated with an increased risk for MM tear. These findings might aid clinicians in identifying patients at risk for a MM tear and informing them.","output":"The prevalence and parameters of fabella and its association with medial meniscal tear in China: a retrospective study of 1011 knees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Inappropriate use of antibiotics has been acknowledged as a significant contributor to the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Physician prescribing of antibiotics has been identified as a factor in the inappropriate use of antibiotics. One methodology that is used in an attempt to alter physician prescribing behaviours is audit and feedback. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of Irish General Practitioners (GPs) towards the national introduction of postal feedback on their antibiotic prescribing behaviours beginning in 2019. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive methodology was used. SemiCstructured interviews were conducted with GPs in receipt of postal audit and feedback. METHOD: GPs working in Ireland and in receipt of postal audit and feedback on their antibiotic prescribing behaviours participated in phone-based interviews. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The collected data was then analysed using an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twelve GPs participated in the study (female = 5). Three themes were identified from the analysis. The themes identified were the reliability and validity of the feedback received, feedback on antibiotic prescribing is useful but limited and feedback needs to be easily digestible. CONCLUSION: While the postal audit and feedback were broadly welcomed by the participants, the themes identified a perceived limitation in the quality of the feedback data, the perception of a likely low public health impact of the feedback and difficulties with efficiently processing the audit and feedback information. These findings can help refine future audit and feedback interventions on antibiotic prescribing.

Since oncogene expression could often modulate sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, we wanted to examine if N-myc expression status would determine virotherapy efficacy to high-risk NB. We showed that induction of exogenous N-myc in a non-N-myc-amplified cell line background (TET-21N) increased susceptibility to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (mutant VSVM51) and alleviated the type I IFN-induced antiviral state. Cells with basal N-myc, on the other hand, were less susceptible to virus-induced oncolysis and established a robust IFN-mediated antiviral state. The same effects were also observed in NB cell lines with and without N-myc amplification. Microarray analysis showed that N-myc overexpression in TET-21N cells downregulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with known antiviral functions. Furthermore, virus infection caused significant changes in global gene expression in TET-21N cells overexpressing N-myc. Such changes involved ISGs with various functions. Therefore, the present study showed that augmented susceptibility to VSVM51 by N-myc at least involves downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions and alleviation of the IFN-stimulated antiviral state.

This renewed interest follows the re-emergence of communicable diseases, largely thought to have disappeared and therefore irrelevant to modern day practitioners. The 2003 SARS outbreak particularly presented propitious circumstances for reconsidering this issue. This study seeks to characterize the views of individuals on the nature and limits of this duty. The authors employed qualitative methods to gather lay and expert perspectives. Individual interviews were conducted with 67 participants consisting of HCPs, spiritual leaders, regulators, and members of the public from the greater Toronto area. Participants views were analyzed and organized according to three main themes, constituting a framework that combines micro-, meso-, and macro-level structures and processes: the scope of obligations of HCPs, the roles of health care institutions, and the broader social context, respectively. Our data suggest that the duty to care must be placed in a wider context to include considerations that transcend individual provider obligations. It thus follows, based on our data, that the duty to care cannot be left to personal choice or an appeal to morality based on an ethic derived entirely from individual obligations. The micro-meso-macro analytical framework that we have developed can guide the articulation of accepted norms of duty to care during epidemics and the development of policy for public health crises. It can also enhance the focus of our current expectations of HCPs duty during epidemics.

Indeed, these molecules were originally employed in the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria, and later in the management of various autoimmune rheumatic and dermatologic diseases. Initially, some promising results for the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating COVID-19 patients were reported by a few in vitro and in vivo studies. However, current evidence is not yet sufficiently solid to warrant its use as a therapy for this disease. Additionally, the therapeutic effects of HCQ are not without many side effects, which range from mild gastrointestinal effects to life-threatening cardiovascular and neurological effects.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: The therapeutic effects of LHQW in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been fully elucidated. A retrospective study was conducted in patients with COVID-19 to evaluate the influence of LHQW on laboratory results related to the disease, and to provide evidence for the clinical practice of TCM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected 248 patients who met the moderate type COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, and received treatment in Tongji Hospital. Patients were divided into control (158 cases, standard treatment) and LHQW treatment (90 cases, standard treatment combined with LHQW) groups according to the different treatments administered. All laboratory data were obtained after 5-7 days' treatment. RESULTS: In this study, the average patient age was 58.95 years and 131 patients were male. The two groups were comparable in demographic characteristics, symptoms, and treatment. Compared with in the control group, D-dimer and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly lower in the LHQW treatment group (2.47  4.67 vs. 1.68  3.61; 44.47  30.24 vs. 35.39  27.43; both P < 0.05).

For example, IFN-gamma polymorphisms, allotypes of the leukocyte IgG (FcgammaR) receptors and certain haplotypes of surfactant genes were linked in pilot studies to otitis media susceptibility. The pattern of gene expression during an episode of otitis media is also being elucidated with the overall goal of providing clues as to which of these modulated genes are polymorphic and thus potentially capable of affecting otitis media susceptibility. Mucin and cathepsin protease genes were shown to exhibit these characteristics.

It was reported that HCQ induced psychiatric symptoms in a few patients with autoimmune diseases, but it is still uncertain whether HCQ poses a risk to mental health. Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24 h and 10 days and enhanced depressive behavior at 24 h. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta and corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Most of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential.

Despite the lack of robust evidence one potential treatment for COVID-19 associated severe hypoxaemia is inhaled pulmonary vasodilator (IPVD) therapy, using either nitric oxide (iNO) or prostaglandins. We describe the implementation of, and outcomes from, a protocol using IPVDs in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 associated respiratory failure receiving maximal conventional support. METHODS Prospectively collected data from adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a large teaching hospital were analysed for the period 14th March 2020 - 11th February 2021. An IPVD was considered if the PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio was less than 13.3kPa despite maximal conventional therapy. Nitric oxide was commenced at 20ppm and titrated to response. If oxygenation improved Iloprost nebulisers were commenced and iNO weaned. The primary outcome was percentage changes in PF ratio and Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient. RESULTS Fifty-nine patients received IPVD therapy during the study period. The median PF ratio before IPVD therapy was commenced was 11.33kPa (9.93-12.91). Patients receiving an IPVD had a lower PF ratio (14.37 vs. 16.37kPa, p = 0.002) and higher APACHE-II score (17 vs. 13, p = 0.028) at ICU admission. At 72 hours after initiating an IPVD the median improvement in PF ratio was 33.9% (-4.3-84.1). At 72 hours changes in PF ratio (70.8 vs. -4.1%, p < 0.001) and reduction in A-a gradient (44.7 vs. 14.8%, p < 0.001) differed significantly between survivors (n = 33) and non-survivors (n = 26). CONCLUSIONS The response to IPVDs in patients with COVID-19 associated acute hypoxic respiratory failure differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors. Both iNO and prostaglandins may offer therapeutic options for patients with severe refractory hypoxaemia due to COVID-19.

The complexity of periodontal tissue and the local inflammatory microenvironment poses great challenges to tissue repair. Recently, stem cells have been considered a promising strategy to treat tissue damage and inflammation because of their remarkable properties, including stemness, proliferation, migration, multilineage differentiation, and immunomodulation. Several varieties of stem cells can potentially be applied to periodontal regeneration, including dental mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs), nonodontogenic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In particular, these stem cells possess extensive immunoregulatory capacities. In periodontitis, these cells can exert anti-inflammatory effects and regenerate the periodontium. Stem cells derived from infected tissue possess typical stem cell characteristics with lower immunogenicity and immunosuppression. Several studies have demonstrated that these cells can also regenerate the periodontium. Furthermore, the interaction of stem cells with the surrounding infected microenvironment is critical to periodontal tissue repair. Though the immunomodulatory capabilities of stem cells are not entirely clarified, they show promise for therapeutic application in periodontitis. Here, we summarize the potential of stem cells for periodontium regeneration in periodontitis and focus on their characteristics and immunomodulatory properties as well as challenges and perspectives.","output":"Immunomodulatory Properties of Stem Cells in Periodontitis: Current Status and Future Prospective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rich structure that we observe in molecular clouds is due to the interplay between strong magnetic fields and supersonic (turbulent) velocity fluctuations.

In an experimental rabbit model, we evaluated the effect of Mw on the UF and UF efficiency of glucose polymers with low polydispersity. METHODS A crossover trial in female New Zealand White rabbits (2.20 - 2.65 kg) with surgically implanted peritoneal catheters evaluated two glucose polymers at nominal concentrations of 7.5 g/dL: a 6K polymer (Mw: 6.4 kDa; polydispersity: 2.3) and a 19K polymer (Mw: 18.8 kDa; polydispersity: 2.0). Rabbits were randomized to receive either the 6K (n = 11) or the 19K (n = 12) solution during the first exchange (40 mL/kg body weight). The alternative solution was evaluated in a second exchange 3 days later. During each 4-hour dwell, the UF and total glucose polymer CHO absorbed were determined. RESULTS The UF was higher for the 6K (p < 0.0001) than for the 19K polymer (mean  standard deviation: 73.6  30.8 mL vs. 43.0  20.2 mL), as was the amount of CHO absorbed (42.5%  9.8% vs. 35.7%  11.0%, p = 0.021). In spite of higher CHO absorption, an approximately 50% higher (p = 0.029) UF efficiency was achieved with the 6K polymer (28.3  18.8 mL/g) than with the 19K polymer (19.0  11.3 mL/g). The results were independent of the order of the experimental exchanges. CONCLUSIONS Glucose polymers with low polydispersity are effective osmotic agents in a rabbit model. The low-Mw polymer was more effective at generating UF and had a higher UF efficiency, but those results came at the expense of the polymer being more readily absorbed from the peritoneal cavity.","output":"Ultrafiltration characteristics of glucose polymers with low polydispersity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of December 14, 2020, children and adolescents aged <18 years have accounted for 10.2% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported in the United States.* Mitigation strategies to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among persons of all ages, are important for pandemic control. Characterization of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents can inform efforts by parents, school and program administrators, and public health officials to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To assess school, community, and close contact exposures associated with pediatric COVID-19, a case-control study was conducted to compare exposures reported by parents or guardians of children and adolescents aged <18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (case-patients) with exposures reported among those who received negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results (control participants). Among 397 children and adolescents investigated, in-person school or child care attendance &#8804;14 days before the SARS-CoV-2 test was reported for 62% of case-patients and 68% of control participants and was not associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-1.3). Among 236 children aged &#8805;2 years who attended child care or school during the 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 testing, parents of 64% of case-patients and 76% of control participants reported that their child and all staff members wore masks inside the facility (aOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8). In the 2 weeks preceding SARS-CoV-2 testing, case-patients were more likely to have had close contact with a person with known COVID-19 (aOR = 3.2, 95% CI = 2.0-5.0), have attended gatherings? with persons outside their household, including social functions (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.5) or activities with other children (aOR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.3-8.4), or have had visitors in the home (aOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-2.9) than were control participants.

In the information era, search engines widely collect public attention, implying potential individual actions, and freely provide open, timelier, and large-scope search query data for helping explore regional phenomena and problems. In this paper, we endeavor to explore the possibility of adopting such data to depict population migration. Based on the search query from Baidu search engine, three migration attention indexes (MAIs) are constructed to capture public migration attention in cyber space. Taking three major urban agglomerations in China as case study, we conduct the correlation analysis among the cyber MAIs and population migration in geographical space. Results have shown that external-MAI and local-MAI can positively reflect the population migration inner regions and across regions from a holistic lens and that intercity-MAI can be a helpful supplement for the delineation of specific population flow.

METHODS: We used data from a trial evaluating a C-reactive protein (CRP) point of care guided approach to managing COPD exacerbations in primary care. We used regression analyses to identify baseline clinical features, including CRP value in those randomized to testing, associated with bacterial, viral or mixed infections, defined by the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens in sputum, detected by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. RESULTS: Of 386 participants with baseline sputum samples, 79 (20.5%), 123 (31.9%), and 91 (23.6%) had bacterial, viral/atypical, and mixed bacterial/viral/atypical pathogens identified, respectively. Increasing sputum purulence assessed by color chart was associated with increased odds of finding bacterial and mixed (bacterial and viral/atypical) pathogens in sputum (area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for bacterial pathogens =0.739 (95% CI: 0.670, 0.808)). Elevated CRP was associated with increased odds of finding bacterial pathogens and mixed pathogens but did not significantly increase the AUROC for predicting bacterial pathogens over sputum color alone (AUROC for combination of sputum color and CRP = 0.776 (95% CI: 0.708, 0.843), p for comparison of models = 0.053).

However, without more accurate case numbers, reliable risk analyses are impossible. Methods: We combine data from three sources - a national seroprevalence study (the SARS-CoV-2 KIDS study), the German statutory notification system and a nationwide registry on children and adolescents hospitalized with either SARS-CoV-2 or Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS-TS) - in order to provide reliable estimates on childrens hospitalization, intensive care admission and death due to COVID-19 and PIMS-TS. Results: While the overall hospitalization rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 35.9 per 10,000 children, ICU admission rate was 1.7 per 10,000 and case fatality was 0.09 per 10,000. Children without comorbidities were found to be significantly less likely to suffer from a severe or fatal disease course. The lowest risk was observed in children aged 5-11 without comorbidities.

METHODS: This study was conducted to determine the rates, risk factors, and molecular genotypes of colonizing Staphylococcus aureus in adult patients presenting to an inner-city academic emergency department. Participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess hospital and community risks for infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Nasal swabs were analyzed by PCR/ESI-MS to identify and genotype S. aureus and CoNS. RESULTS: Of 200 patients evaluated, 59 were colonized with S. aureus; 27 of these were methicillin-resistant strains. Twenty-four of the 59 S. aureus carriers were co-colonized with a CoNS and 140 of the 200 patients were colonized exclusively with CoNS. The molecular genotypes of the 59 S. aureus strains were diverse; 21 unique molecular genotypes belonging to seven major clonal complexes were identified. Eighty-five of 200 patients carried strains with high-level mupirocin resistance. Of these eighty-five participants, 4 were colonized exclusively with S. aureus, 16 were co-colonized with S. aureus and CoNS, and 65 were colonized exclusively with CoNS.

Further, studies comparing cardiac biomarker levels in survivors versus nonsurvivors were included. A total of 14 studies (3,175 patients) were utilized for the final analysis. Cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 was associated with higher risk of mortality (risk ratio [RR]:7.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.69 to 13.01; I2=58%), ICU admission (RR: 4.06; 95% CI: 1.50 to 10.97; I2a?=a?61%), mechanical ventilation (RR: 5.53; 95% CI: 3.09 to 9.91; I2a?=a?0%), and developing coagulopathy (RR: 3.86; 95% CI:2.81 to 5.32; I2a?=a?0%).

Its causes are capillary endothelial cell dysfunction, associated carditis, low oxygenization, and increased sympathetic tone, which all worsen myocardial stiffness and microvascular dysfunction (MD). They lead to severe myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmia, acute congestive heart failure, and a significant rise in death cases. During COVID-19, no specific cardiological treatment is started. As adjuvant therapy, anxiolytics in COVID-19 are widely used, but not in all anxious patients who had been infected with coronavirus. Anxiolytics can be useful to moderate MD and immunosuppressive effect of anxiety. The favorable effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in the treatment of myocardial ischemia and heart failure had previously been proven, and also their anti-inflammatory effects had been suspected; however, they have not yet been used in COVID-19 cases. TMZ promotes glucose-mediated ATP production, which requires less oxygen, which explains its advantageous cardiac effects. Since it lowers serum and myocardial tissue proinflammatory cytokine levels and inhibits myocardial macrophage infiltration, it was suspected that TMZ might represent a novel therapeutic agent to prevent and treat sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction. CoQ10 plays an important role in cellular ATP production; however, its concentration is decreased in cardiovascular diseases and in influenza patients. Due to its anti-inflammatory effect, CoQ10 has been suspected to have a key therapeutic target in influenza infection.

Logistic regression models were used to examine the outcomes of climate change opinions and COVID-19 perceptions and prevention behaviors (perceived COVID-19 risk, mask wearing, social distancing, and vaccine intentions). Covariates included political ideology, conspiracy beliefs, and trust in scientific information about COVID-19. In the multivariable models of COVID-19 perceptions and prevention behaviors, climate change opinions were also included as a covariate. In these models, climate change attitudes were significantly associated with perceived risk of COVID-19, always wearing masks, decreased time spent with others due to COVID-19, and intending to get COVID-19 vaccine. In adjusted models, the odds of wearing a mask increased 41% (CI: 1.11-1.78) for every 1-point increase on the climate attitude scale and decreased 13% (CI: 0.79-0.96) if the participant distrusted COVID-19 information.

Yet, despite their importance, metacognitive skills may not be well-captured by measures of general intelligence. These skills have instead been the focus of decades of research in the psychology of human judgment and decision-making. This literature provides well-validated tests of metacognitive awareness and demonstrates that the capacity to use analysis and deliberation to evaluate intuitive responses is an important source of individual differences in decision-making. Research in network neuroscience further elucidates the topology and dynamics of brain networks that enable metacognitive awareness, providing key targets for intervention. As such, we further discuss emerging scientific interventions to enhance metacognitive skills (e.g., based on mindfulness meditation, and physical activity and aerobic fitness), and how such interventions may catalyze the virtuous cycle to improve collective intelligence, societal problem-solving, and global wellbeing.","output":"Beyond IQ: The Importance of Metacognition for the Promotion of Global Wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report updates the 2019C20 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States (MMWR Recomm Rep 2019;68[No. RR-3]).

Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) are expected to be available. Most influenza vaccines available for the 2020C21 season will be quadrivalent, with the exception of MF59-adjuvanted IIV, which is expected to be available in both quadrivalent and trivalent formulations. Updates to the recommendations described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP held on October 23, 2019; February 26, 2020; and June 24, 2020. Primary updates to this report include the following two items. First, the composition of 2020C21 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B/Victoria lineage components. Second, recent licensures of two new influenza vaccines, Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent and Fluad Quadrivalent, are discussed. Both new vaccines are licensed for persons aged 65 years. Additional changes include updated discussion of contraindications and precautions to influenza vaccination and the accompanying Table, updated discussion concerning use of LAIV4 in the setting of influenza antiviral medication use, and updated recommendations concerning vaccination of persons with egg allergy who receive either cell cultureCbased IIV4 (ccIIV4) or RIV4. The 2020C21 influenza season will coincide with the continued or recurrent circulation of SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus associated with coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). Influenza vaccination of persons aged 6 months to reduce prevalence of illness caused by influenza will reduce symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19. Prevention of and reduction in the severity of influenza illness and reduction of outpatient illnesses, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions through influenza vaccination also could alleviate stress on the U.S. health care system.

The qualitative study aims to explore the lived experiences, beliefs, feelings, and challenges faced by Pakistani migrant physicians working in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An exploratory phenomenological approach was used to collate data on experiences expressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purposive and snowball sampling was used to target participants, which were doctors of Pakistani origin involved in the direct care and management of COVID-19 patients in different NHS hospitals of the United Kingdom. Semi-structured, in-depth telephonic interviews were conducted with study participants in May 2020. Data analysis was done parallel with data collection by using an inductive qualitative approach. RESULTS: We recruited ten frontline physicians. Four theme categories emerged from the data analysis: 1) Working across borders and cultures, 2) Role of beliefs for coping with stress and fear, 3) Passion and profession, and 4) Scaffolding the Pakistani health system. Overall, the results show that the participants received limited professional support, in terms of counseling and psychological rehabilitation. Instead, they had to use self-management strategies to cope with the situation. CONCLUSION: The intensive work exhausted participants physically and emotionally. They were holding a lot of grief and hurt inside, but still, healthcare professionals showed the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Although currently coping with their emotional problems, comprehensive professional support should be made available to cater to the wellbeing of frontline physicians.

We developed the School-Age Health, Activity, Resilience, Anthropometry and Neurocognitive (SAHARAN) toolbox to measure growth, cognitive and physical function in rural Zimbabwe. Methods: The SAHARAN toolbox was developed using a stepwise approach, with tool selection based on COSMIN principles. Growth was measured with anthropometry, skinfold thicknesses and bioimpedance analysis to obtain lean mass index (LMI) and phase angle. Cognition was assessed using a fine motor finger tapping task, school achievement test (SAT), and the Kaufmann Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-2) to determine the mental processing index (MPI). Physical function combined grip strength, broad jump and the 20m shuttle run test to produce a total physical score (TPS). A detailed caregiver questionnaire was performed in parallel. Results: 80 Zimbabwean children with mean (SD) age 7.6 (0.2) years had mean height-for-age (HAZ) and weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ) of -0.63 (0.81) and -0.55 (0.85), respectively. For growth measures, LMI and total skinfold thicknesses were highly related to both WAZ and BMI Z-score, but not to HAZ. For physical function, TPS was associated with unit rises in HAZ (1.29, 95%CI 0.75,1.82, p<0.001), and LMI (0.50, 95%CI 0.16,0.83, p=0.004), but not skinfold thicknesses. For cognition, the SAT was highly associated with unit increases in the MPI (0.9 marks, 95%CI 0.4,1.3, p<0.001) and a child socioemotional questionnaire (8.2 marks, 95%CI 2.9,13.5, p=0.003). Phase angle was associated with 3.5 seconds quicker time to complete the finger tapping task (95%CI 0.6,6.4, p=0.02). No child outcomes were associated with socioeconomic status, nurturing, discipline, food and water insecurity, or household adversity. Conclusions: We found clear associations between growth, height-adjusted lean mass and physical function, but not cognitive function, in a cohort of Zimbabwean children.

NEP's role in degradation of diverse classes of peptides such as amyloid beta, natriuretic peptide, substance P, angiotensin, endothelins, etc., is associated with pathologies of alzheimer's, kidney and heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and certain malignancies. Hence the functional inhibition of NEP in the above systems can be a good therapeutic target. In the present study, in-silico drug repurposing approach was used to identify NEP inhibitors. Molecular docking was carried out using GLIDE tool and 2934 drugs from the ZINC12 database were screened using high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) followed by standard precision (SP), and extra precision (XP) docking. Based on the XP docking score and ligand interaction, the top 8 hits were subjected to free ligand binding energy calculation, to filter out 4 hits (ZINC000000001427, ZINC000001533877, ZINC000000601283, and ZINC000003831594). Further, induced fit docking-standard precision (IFD-SP) and molecular dynamics (MD) studies were performed. The results obtained from MD +studies suggest that ZINC000000601283-NEP and ZINC000003831594-NEP complexes were most stable for 20ns simulation period as compared to ZINC000001533877-NEP and ZINC000000001427-NEP complexes. Interestingly, ZINC000000601283 and ZINC000003831594 showed similarity in binding with reported NEP inhibitor sacubitrilat. Findings from this study suggest that ZINC000000601283 and ZINC000003831594 may act as NEP inhibitors. In future studies, the role of ZINC000000601283 and ZINC000003831594 in NEP inhibition should be tested in biological systems to evaluate therapeutic effect in NEP associated pathological conditions.","output":"Repurposing of existing FDA approved drugs for Neprilysin inhibition: an in-silico study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this project was to develop a set of patient-reported outcome measures for adolescents and adults who meet criteria for a psychotic disorder. METHODS A research team and an international consensus working group, including service users, clinicians, and researchers, worked together in an iterative process by using a modified Delphi consensus technique that included videoconferencing calls, online surveys, and focus groups. The research team conducted systematic literature searches to identify outcomes, outcome measures, and risk adjustment factors. After identifying outcomes important to service users, the consensus working group selected outcome measures, risk adjustment factors, and the final set of outcome measures. International stakeholder groups consisting of >100 professionals and service users reviewed and commented on the final set. RESULTS The consensus working group identified four outcome domains: symptoms, recovery, functioning, and treatment. The domains encompassed 14 outcomes of importance to service users. The research team identified 131 measures from the literature. The consensus working group selected nine measures in an outcome set that takes approximately 35 minutes to complete. CONCLUSIONS A set of patient-reported outcome measures for use in routine clinical practice was identified. The set is free to service users, is available in at least two languages, and reflects outcomes important to users.

In this study, we hypothesized that diffusion of inhaled anesthetics from airway lumen to smooth muscle would yield significant bronchodilation in vivo, and systemic recirculation would not be necessary to reduce lung resistance (R(L)) and elastance (E(L)) during sustained bronchoconstriction. To test this hypothesis, we designed a delivery system for precise timing of inhaled volatile anesthetics during the course of a positive pressure breath. We compared changes in R(L), E(L), and anatomic dead space (V(D)) in canines (N = 5) during pharmacologically induced bronchoconstriction with intravenous methacholine, and following treatments with: (1) targeted anesthetic delivery to V(D) and (2) continuous anesthetic delivery throughout inspiration. Both sevoflurane and isoflurane were used during each delivery regimen. Compared to continuous delivery, targeted delivery resulted in significantly lower doses of delivered anesthetic and decreased end-expiratory concentrations. However, we did not detect significant reductions in R(L) or E(L) for either anesthetic delivery regimen. This lack of response may have resulted from an insufficient dose of the anesthetic to cause bronchodilation, or from the preferential distribution of air flow with inhaled anesthetic delivery to less constricted, unobstructed regions of the lung, thereby enhancing airway heterogeneity and increasing apparent R(L) and E(L).","output":"Targeted Versus Continuous Delivery of Volatile Anesthetics During Cholinergic Bronchoconstriction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The growth and development of tumors are closely related to the initiation and amplification of the inflammatory response. Various inflammatory biomarkers had attained growing attention for nearly two decades and were discovered strongly associated with cancer patients prognosis, indicating that systemic inflammatory response is possibly essential to cancer progression. However, little was known about the sensitive biomarkers associated with the detection, persistence, treatment, and prognosis of GBM. Hence, the retrospective research endeavored to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative inflammatory biomarkers in patients with GBM who initially received standardized treatment. METHODS: The 232 glioblastoma patients eligible who were admitted to Qilu Hospitals in Shandong Province from January 2014 to January 2018 were collected for this analysis. Inflammatory markers, including the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), systemic immune response index (SIRI), neutrophilClymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and albumin/globulin ratio (AGR), were designed. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the KaplanCMeier method, and we calculated the area under the ROC curve to determine the AUC value. Besides, we used the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the relationship between variables and PFS and OS. The statistical differences between variables and PFS and OS were tested through the log-rank test. What is more, the LR method was used to perform Cox multiple regression analysis. The results were represented by hazard ratio (HR), 95% CI, any 2-tailed P < 0.01 was accepted as statistically different. RESULTS: The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model presented that SII  659.1 was an independent risk factor affecting OS (HR = 2.238, 95% CI = 1.471C3.406, P < 0.001) and postoperative PFS (HR = 2.000, 95% CI = 1.472C2.716, P < 0.001) in GBM patients. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of the SII < 659.1 group was 70.8%, 26.9%, and 14.1%, respectively, while the 1- and 3-year OS of the SII  659.1 group was 37.5% and 11.5% (P < 0.001). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year PFS of the SII < 659.1 group was 36.3%, 19.6%, and 13%, respectively, while the 1-year PFS of the SII  659.1 group was 11.3% (P < 0.001). Results of patients clinical and pathological characteristics paraded that in comparison to the lower SII group, the higher SII group had significantly inferior Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores (P < 0.001) and more frequent cystic changes of the tumors (P < 0.001), whereas the values of SIRI, NLR, PLR, MLR, and AGR were low.

In approximately 20% it is followed by a second stage heralded by elevation of pro-inflammatory markers such as ferritin, IL-6, CRP, LDH and D-dimers. We hypothesized that those with few abnormalities would have a low risk for progression to respiratory insufficiency and hence could be monitored at home without treatment. METHODS: Inclusion criteria included Covid infection, age >21, Oxygen saturation >90%. To be observed without treatment, patients could have no more than 1 of the following: CRP > 10 mg/dL, high LDH, ferritin > 500 ng/ml, D-dimer > 1 mg/L, IL-6 > 10 pg/ml, absolute lymphocyte count <1,000, Oxygen saturation <94%, or CT chest evidence of pneumonia. Primary endpoint was progression to respiratory failure and secondary endpoints was 28-day survival. RESULTS: Of 208 entered, 132 were low-risk and hence were monitored without therapy.

An automatic feces detection and trait recognition system based on a visual sensor could greatly alleviate the burden on medical inspectors and overcome many sanitation problems, such as infections. Unfortunately, the lack of digital medical images acquired with camera sensors due to patient privacy has obstructed the development of fecal examinations. In general, the computing power of an automatic fecal diagnosis machine or a mobile computer-aided diagnosis device is not always enough to run a deep network. Thus, a light-weight practical framework is proposed, which consists of three stages: illumination normalization, feces detection, and trait recognition. Illumination normalization effectively suppresses the illumination variances that degrade the recognition accuracy. Neither the shape nor the location is fixed, so shape-based and location-based object detection methods do not work well in this task. Meanwhile, this leads to a difficulty in labeling the images for training convolutional neural networks (CNN) in detection. Our segmentation scheme is free from training and labeling. The feces object is accurately detected with a well-designed threshold-based segmentation scheme on the selected color component to reduce the background disturbance. Finally, the preprocessed images are categorized into five classes with a light-weight shallow CNN, which is suitable for feces trait examinations in real hospital environments.

Previous studies suggest that NLPHL histological variants represent progression forms of NLPHL and THRLBCL transformation in aggressive disease. Since molecular studies of both lymphomas are limited due to the low number of tumor cells, the present study aimed to learn if a better understanding of these lymphomas is possible via detailed measurements of nuclear and cell size features in 2D and 3D sections. Whereas no significant differences were visible in 2D analyses, a slightly increased nuclear volume and a significantly enlarged cell size were noted in 3D measurements of the tumor cells of THRLBCL in comparison to typical NLPHL cases. Interestingly, not only was the size of the tumor cells increased in THRLBCL but also the nuclear volume of concomitant T cells in the reactive infiltrate when compared with typical NLPHL. Particularly CD8+ T cells had frequent contacts to tumor cells of THRLBCL. However, the nuclear volume of B cells was comparable in all cases. These results clearly demonstrate that 3D tissue analyses are superior to conventional 2D analyses of histological sections. Furthermore, the results point to a strong activation of T cells in THRLBCL, representing a cytotoxic response against the tumor cells with unclear effectiveness, resulting in enhanced swelling of the tumor cell bodies and limiting proliferative potential.

The classic Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of clonal haematopoietic disorders, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and myelofibrosis (MF), whose shared and diverse phenotypic signatures are caused by a dysregulated JAK/STAT signal transduction because of acquired somatic mutations. It has been demonstrated that autoimmune diseases and MPN can be associated (Kristinsson et al., Haematologica. 2010 Jul;95(7):1216-20.), suggesting a common background of immune dysregulation (Barosi, Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2014 Dec;9(4):331-9). SARS-CoV-2 infection displays extreme inter-individual clinical variability, ranging from silent infection to lethal disease. It has been described that at least 10% of patients with life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia have neutralizing autoantibodies (AAbs) against type I IFNs, that precede SARS-CoV-2 infection (Bastard et al., Science. 2020 Oct 23;370(6515):eabd4585). In this study we searched for AAbs against type I IFNs in a cohort of MPN patients to evaluate the prevalence of these AAbs in the MPN population and to check for clinical correlations, including severity of COVID-19. Methods. Plasma samples from consecutively referred MPN patients were prospectively collected between November 2020 and June 2021 and frozen at -30C immediately after collection. Levels of AAbs against type I IFN subtypes including IFNs alpha, beta and omega were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a neutralization assay, as previously reported (Bastard et al., Science. 2020 Oct 23;370(6515):eabd4585; Moreews et al., Sci Immunol. 2021 May 25;6(59):eabh1516). Results. We included a total of 219 MPN patients (101 ET, 76 PV, 36 MF and 6 MPN unclassificable). Neutralizing AAbs to type I IFNs were detected in 29 patients (13.2%, 95%CI: 9.1% - 18.5%). Comparing patients with and without AAbs we observed a significant difference in terms of distribution of MPN diagnosis (P = 0.029) and driver mutations (P = 0.019), while we did not observe a difference in terms of age, sex, and treatment (Table 1). Overall, 29 patients (13%) got SARS-CoV-2 infection and 8 of them (28%) required hospitalization due to severe COVID-19. AAbs against type I IFNs were detected in 4 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. A higher rate of hospitalization for severe COVID-19 was observed in patients with AAbs to type I IFNs (2 of 4 patients, 50%) compared to those without these AAbs (6 of 25 patients, 24%), although the difference did not reach a statistical significance (P = 0.300). Conclusions. In this study, we detected a prevalence of AAbs against type I IFNs which is much higher in our MPN cohort (13%) than in the general population (2-3%). We also found a correlation between the presence of AAbs to type I IFNs and both the hematological diagnosis and the driver mutation. Despite a comparable prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection between MPN patients with or without AAbs to type I IFNs, we observed a different rate of hospitalization due to severe COVID-19 which is almost twice in those with AAbs against type I IFNs compared to those without these AAbs. However, this difference did not reach a statistical significance, probably because of the low number of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the subgroup of patients with AAbs against type I IFNs. Thus, further studies to analyse the prevalence of AAbs against type I IFNs in patients with MPN, their association with other forms of auto-immunity and severe COVID-19 are warranted.

Recently, indocyanine green and near-infrared imaging have been used to aid in sentinel node biopsy. The present study aimed to determine the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green SPY Elite navigation and to critically evaluate the technique compared with the standard modalities. METHODS A retrospective review of 90 consecutive cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Two cohorts were formed: group A, which had sentinel lymph node biopsy performed with blue dye and radioisotope; and group B, which had sentinel lymph node biopsy performed with radioisotope and indocyanine green SPY Elite navigation. The cohorts were compared to assess for differences in localization rates, sensitivity and specificity of sentinel node identification, and length of surgery. RESULTS The sentinel lymph node localization rate was 79.4 percent using the blue dye method, 98.0 percent using the indocyanine green fluorescence method, and 97.8 percent using the radioisotope/handheld gamma probe method. Indocyanine green fluorescence detected more sentinel lymph nodes than the vital dye method alone (p = 0.020). A trend toward a reduction in length of surgery was noted in the SPY Elite cohort. CONCLUSIONS Sentinel lymph node mapping and localization in cutaneous melanoma with the indocyanine green SPY Elite navigation system is technically feasible and may offer several advantages over current modalities, including higher sensitivity and specificity, decreased number of lymph nodes sampled, decreased operative time, and potentially lower false-negative rates.

For the first time at our dental school, theoretical knowledge was imparted to students via asynchronous online screencasts and discussed via synchronous video meetings only. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of distance education as a new teaching format for theoretical knowledge within the preclinical course in Operative Dentistry (sixth semester of the undergraduate dental curriculum in Germany). METHODS: The phantom course comprised distance education (first phase, 11 weeks) and subsequent on-site practical demonstrations and training (second phase, 10 weeks). All theoretical knowledge was taught via online screencasts during distance education (except for the first week, 3 screencasts were uploaded per week resulting in a total of 30 screencasts). Until the end of the term, all students (N=33) were able to view the screencasts for an unlimited number of times. Theoretical knowledge was assessed in a summative examination after practical on-site teaching. Acceptance and effectiveness of the new curriculum and distance education were also measured based on an evaluation survey and students' self-perceived learning outcome, which was compared to the outcome from the two pre-COVID-19 terms. RESULTS: Each screencast was viewed by a mean of 24 (SD 3.3) students and accessed a mean of 5.6 (SD 1.2) times per user (ie, by students who accessed the respective screencast at least once). During distance education, the number of accesses showed a linear trend over time. During the practical training phase, screencast views declined and increased again prior to the examination. Screencasts covering topics in Cariology, Restorative Dentistry, and Preventive Dentistry were viewed by more students than screencasts covering topics in Endodontology or Periodontology (both P=.047). Examination items in Periodontology showed inferior results compared to the other topics (P<.001). Within the different topics, students' self-perceived learning outcome did not differ from that during the pre-COVID-19 terms. Although most students agreed that the presented screencasts contributed to their learning outcome, pre-COVID-19 term students more strongly felt that lectures significantly contributed to their learning outcome (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Screencasts showed high acceptance and effectiveness among the students but were not used as a learning tool by all students. However, students who viewed the screencasts accessed each screencast more frequently than they could have attended a conventional lecture. Screencast views were mostly due to intrinsic motivation.","output":"Remote Teaching in a Preclinical Phantom Course in Operative Dentistry During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the association of pre-morbid functional status [Barthel Index (BI)] and frailty [modified Frailty Index (mFI)] with in-hospital mortality and a risk scoring system developed for COVID-19 in patients 75 years diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective bicentric observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data on consecutive patients aged 75 years admitted with COVID-19 at 2 Italian tertiary care centers were collected from February 22 to May 30, 2020. METHODS: Overall, 221 consecutive patients with COVID-19 aged 75 years were admitted to 2 hospitals in the study period and were included in the analysis. Clinical, functional (BI), frailty (mFI), laboratory, and imaging data were collected. Mortality risk on admission was assessed with the COVID-19 Mortality Risk Score (COVID-19 MRS), a dedicated score developed for hospital triage. RESULTS: Ninety-seven (43.9%) patients died. BI, frailty, age, dementia, respiratory rate, Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio, creatinine, and platelet count were associated with mortality. Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) indicated that the predictivity of age was modest and the combination of BI, mFI, and COVID-19 MRS yielded the highest prediction accuracy (AUC(COVID-19MRS+BI+mFI) vs AUC(Age): 0.87 vs 0.59; difference: +0.28, lower boundCupper bound: 0.17-0.34, P < .001).

Origins of asthma are suggested to be placed in early life with heterogeneous clinical presentation, severity and pathophysiology. Exacerbations of asthma disease can be triggered by many factors, including viral respiratory tract infections. Rhinovirus (RV) induced respiratory infections are the predominant cause of the common cold and also play a crucial role in asthma development and exacerbations. Rhinovirus mainly replicates in epithelial cells lining the upper and lower respiratory tract. Type III interferons, also known as interferon-lambda (IFN), are potent immune mediators of resolution of infectious diseases but they are known to be involved in autoimmune diseases as well. The protective role of type III IFNs in antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiprotozoal functions is of major importance for our innate immune system. The IFN receptor (IFNR) is expressed in selected types of cells like epithelial cells, thus orchestrating a specific immune response at the site of viruses and bacteria entry into the body. In asthma, IFN restricts the development of TH2 cells, which are induced in the airways of asthmatic patients. Several studies described type III IFNs as the predominant type of interferon increased after infection caused by respiratory viruses. It efficiently reduces viral replication, viral spread into the lungs and viral transmission from infected to naive individuals. Several reports showed that bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects have a deficient response of type III interferon after RV infection ex vivo. Toll like Receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed on infectious agents, and induce the development of antiviral and antibacterial immunity. We recently discovered that activation of TLR7/8 resulted in enhanced IFN receptor mRNA expression in PBMCs of healthy and asthmatic children, opening new therapeutic frontiers for rhinovirus-induced asthma. This article reviews the recent advances of the literature on the regulated expression of type III Interferons and their receptor in association with rhinovirus infection in asthmatic subjects.","output":"Regulation and Function of Interferon-Lambda (IFN) and Its Receptor in Asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Y chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes found in males of animals of different taxa, including insects and mammals. Among all chromosomes, the Y chromosome is characterized by a unique chromatin landscape undergoing dynamic evolutionary change. Being entirely heterochromatic, the Y chromosome as a rule preserves few functional genes, but is enriched in tandem repeats and transposons. Due to difficulties in the assembly of the highly repetitive Y chromosome sequence, deep analyses of Y chromosome evolution, structure, and functions are limited to a few species, one of them being Drosophila melanogaster. Despite Y chromosomes exhibiting high structural divergence between even closely related species, Y-linked genes have evolved convergently and are mainly associated with spermatogenesis-related activities. This indicates that male-specific selection is a dominant force shaping evolution of Y chromosomes across species. This review presents our analysis of current knowledge concerning Y chromosome functions, focusing on recent findings in Drosophila. Here we dissect the experimental and bioinformatics data about the Y chromosome accumulated to date in Drosophila species, providing comparative analysis with mammals, and discussing the relevance of our analysis to a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, including humans.","output":"Drosophila as a Model System for Studying of the Evolution and Functional Specialization of the Y Chromosome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Short read sequencing has been used extensively to decipher the genome diversity of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strains, but falls short to reveal individual genomes in mixed HCMV strain populations. Novel third-generation sequencing platforms offer an extended read length and promise to resolve how distant polymorphic sites along individual genomes are linked. In the present study, we established a long amplicon PacBio sequencing workflow to identify the absolute and relative quantities of unique HCMV haplotypes spanning over multiple hypervariable sites in mixtures. Initial validation of this approach was performed with defined HCMV DNA templates derived from cell-culture enriched viruses and was further tested for its suitability on patient samples carrying mixed HCMV infections. RESULTS: Total substitution and indel error rate of mapped reads ranged from 0.17 to 0.43% depending on the stringency of quality trimming. Artificial HCMV DNA mixtures were correctly determined down to 1% abundance of the minor DNA source when the total HCMV DNA input was 4  10(4) copies/ml. PCR products of up to 7.7 kb and a GC content < 55% were efficiently generated when DNA was directly isolated from patient samples. In a single sample, up to three distinct haplotypes were identified showing varying relative frequencies. Alignments of distinct haplotype sequences within patient samples showed uneven distribution of sequence diversity, interspersed by long identical stretches. Moreover, diversity estimation at single polymorphic regions as assessed by short amplicon sequencing may markedly underestimate the overall diversity of mixed haplotype populations. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative haplotype determination by long amplicon sequencing provides a novel approach for HCMV strain characterisation in mixed infected samples which can be scaled up to cover the majority of the genome by multi-amplicon panels. This will substantially improve our understanding of intra-host HCMV strain diversity and its dynamic behaviour.

Published studies demonstrating this effect based their findings on a limited range of vaccines or subset of populations, and did not include booster vaccine doses or immunity obtained due to covid-19 infection. Here we evaluate effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines, booster doses or previous infection against covid-19 infection, hospital admission or death for the whole population in the Czech Republic. MethodsData used in this study cover the whole population of the Czech Republic reported as infected and/or vaccinated between the first detected case on March 1, 2020 and November 20, 2021 (for reinfections), or December 26, 2020 and November 20, 2021 (for vaccinations), including hospital admissions and deaths. Vaccinations by all vaccines approved in the EU were included in this study. Anonymous, individual-level data including dates of vaccination, infection, hospital admission and death were provided by the the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic. The risks of reinfection, breakthrough infection after vaccination, hospital admission and death were calculated using hazard ratios from a Cox regression adjusted for sex, age, vaccine type and vaccination status. FindingsThe vaccine effectiveness against any PCR-confirmed infection declined from 87% (95% CI 86-87) at 0-2 months after the second dose to 53% (95% CI 52-54) at 7-8 months for Comirnaty, from 90% (95% CI 89-91) at 0-2 monthsto 65% (95% CI 63-67) at 7-8 months for Spikevax, and from 83% (95% CI 80-85) at 0-2 months to 55% at (95% CI 54-56) 5-6 months for the Vaxzevria. For Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine we found no significant decline but the estimates are less certain. The vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions and deaths decayed at a significantly lower rate with about 15%, resp. 10% decline during the first 6-8 months. The administration of a booster dose returns the protection to or above the estimates in the first two months after dose 2. In unvaccinated but previously SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals the protection against PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection declined from close to 97% (95% CI 97-97) after 2 months through 90% at 6 months down to 72% (95% CI 65-78) at 18 months. InterpretationOur results confirm the waning of vaccination-induced immunity against infection and a smaller decline in the protection against hospital admission and death. A booster dose is shown to restore the vaccine effectiveness back to the levels seen soon after the completion of the basic vaccination schedule. The post-infection immunity decreases over time, too.

Published studies also suggest a significant boosting in vaccine effectiveness against infection about one week after the third vaccine dose. However, these observations come from different and often limited data sets. Moreover, the existing studies do not compare the decline in vaccine effectiveness with a decline in infection-based immunity in unvaccinated individuals. Added value of this studyIn our study, we bring together data on infections, vaccinations (including booster doses), hospital admissions and deaths to estimate how the protection due to vaccination or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection declines with time, for the whole population of the Czech Republic. Our findings show an overall decrease in vaccine effectiveness over time and a large increase after the administration of a booster dose. At the same time we show a fairly stable and high post-infection immunity over the study period. We hope this evidence will contribute to a better understanding of the changing impact of vaccines and previous infection in complex, real-world environments, which is crucial for the development of more effective and more easily communicated public health policies. Implications of all the available evidenceOur results strongly support a timely and widespread application of booster vaccine doses since their application appears to restore the vaccine-induced protection to the levels attained soon after completing the original vaccination scheme, including the high protection against mild disease or asymptomatic infection.","output":"Real-life protection provided by vaccination, booster doses and previous infection against covid-19 infection, hospitalisation or death over time in the Czech Republic: a whole country retrospective view"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Workarounds in business processes and information systems (IS) have attracted research attention in recent years.

Despite a historical context of public health crises, data sharing agreements and transactional standards do not uniformly exist between institutions which hamper a foundational infrastructure to meet data sharing and integration needs for the advancement of public health. APPROACH: There is a growing need to apply population health knowledge with technological solutions to data transfer, integration, and reasoning, to improve health in a broader learning health system ecosystem. To achieve this, data must be combined from healthcare provider organizations, public health departments, and other settings. Public health entities are in a unique position to consume these data, however, most do not yet have the infrastructure required to integrate data sources and apply computable knowledge to combat this pandemic. OUTCOMES: Herein, we describe lessons learned and a framework to address these needs, which focus on: (a) identifying and filling technology gaps; (b) pursuing collaborative design of data sharing requirements and transmission mechanisms; (c) facilitating cross\\\\domain discussions involving legal and research compliance; and (d) establishing or participating in multi\\\\institutional convening or coordinating activities.

Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a reproducible, accurate, and simple method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease in serum. This work describes the SELDI-TOF MS analyses of sera of 60 PRRSV-positive and 60 PRRSV-negative, as measured by PCR, asymptomatic Large White piglets at weaning. Sera with comparable and low content of hemoglobin (< 4.52 g/mL) were fractionated in 6 different fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range 1C200 kDa were obtained with the CM10, IMAC30, and H50 surfaces. RESULTS: A total of 200 significant peaks (p < 0.05) were identified in the initial discovery phase of the study and 47 of them were confirmed in the validation phase. The majority of peaks (42) were up-regulated in PRRSV-positive piglets, while 5 were down-regulated.

METHODS: Data were from the 8th wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (2016/17), stratified by age (n = 1578 aged <65; n = 4026 aged 65+). Inverse probability weighting was used to estimate average effects of weekly in-person and remote social contact on depressive symptoms (score of 3+ on 8-item CES-D scale) and two measures of loneliness (sometimes/often feels lonely vs hardly ever/never; and top quintile of UCLA loneliness scale vs all others). We also estimated controlled direct effects of education, partner status, and wealth on loneliness and depressive symptoms under two scenarios: 1) universal infrequent (<weekly) in-person social contact; and 2) universal weekly remote social contact. RESULTS: Weekly in-person social contact was associated on average with reduced odds of loneliness, but associations with remote social contact were weak. Lower education raised odds of depressive symptoms and loneliness, but differences were attenuated with infrequent in-person contact. Respondents living alone experienced more depressive symptoms and loneliness than those living with a partner, and less wealth was associated with more depressive symptoms. With universal infrequent in-person contact, these differences narrowed among those aged under 65 but widened among those aged 65+.

Strength and balance interventions significantly reduce the risk of falls; however, patients seldom perform the dose of exercise that is required based on evidence. Health professionals play an important role in supporting older adults as they perform and progress in their exercises. Teleconferencing could enable health professionals to support patients more frequently, which is important in exercise behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the overall concept and acceptability of teleconferencing for the delivery of falls rehabilitation with health care professionals and older adults and to examine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of teleconferencing delivery with health care professionals and patients. METHODS: There were 2 stages to the research: patient and public involvement workshops and usability and feasibility testing. A total of 2 workshops were conducted, one with 5 health care professionals and the other with 8 older adults from a community strength and balance exercise group. For usability and feasibility testing, we tested teleconferencing both one-to-one and in small groups on a smartphone with one falls service and their patients for 3 weeks. Semistructured interviews and focus groups were used to explore acceptability, usability, and feasibility. Focus groups were conducted with the service that used teleconferencing with patients and 2 other services that received only a demonstration of how teleconferencing works. Qualitative data were analyzed using the framework approach. RESULTS: In the workshops, the health care professionals thought that teleconferencing provided an opportunity to save travel time. Older adults thought that it could enable increased support. Safety is of key importance, and delivery needs to be carefully considered. Both older adults and health care professionals felt that it was important that technology did not eliminate face-to-face contact. There were concerns from older adults about the intrusiveness of technology. For the usability and feasibility testing, 7 patients and 3 health care professionals participated, with interviews conducted with 6 patients and a focus group with the health care team. Two additional teams (8 health professionals) took part in a demonstration and focus group. Barriers and facilitators were identified, with 5 barriers around reliability due to poor connectivity, cost of connectivity, safety concerns linked to positioning of equipment and connectivity, intrusiveness of technology, and resistance to group teleconferencing. Two facilitators focused on the positive benefits of increased support and monitoring and positive solutions for future improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconferencing as a way of delivering fall prevention interventions can be acceptable to older adults, patients, and health care professionals if it works effectively.

Up to 35% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic; however, no recommendations exist for universal testing in hospitalized patients. We assessed the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst hospitalized patients at a tertiary care center during a time when there was a regional surge of cases. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was performed on inpatients at Georgetown University Hospital on 4/27/20, excluding those who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, tested within 72 hours or admitted to pediatric, psychiatric, labor & delivery or ICUs. Patients within the hospital were not cohorted based on COVID-19 status. Patient demographics and comorbidities were obtained from the EMR and analyzed for significance based on SARS-CoV-2 status. RESULTS: Hospital census on the testing date was 297; 204/297(68.7%) met inclusion criteria; 78/297(26.3%) were known COVID-19 patients. Within the study group 78/204 (38.2%) had known COVID-19, 21/204 (10.3%) were PUIs (4 of whom tested positive), 31/204 (15.1%) tested negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours and 74/204 (36.3%) met criteria for testing. The median age was 62 years (IQR, 53 to 70), 59%(n=122) were male, 56%(n= 115) were Black, and 90%(n=185) had at least one co-morbidity. 0/74 of those tested on 4/27/20 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and none were diagnosed with COVID-19 within 28 days. In adjusted analyses, patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 were more likely to be Black(OR=10.53 95% CI 3.02, 36.68, p=0.0002); male(OR=3.27 95% CI 1.26, 8.47, p=0.0143); reside in group/nursing homes(OR= 11.78 95%CI 3.03, 45.76, p=0.0004); have a history of prior stroke(OR= 6.25 95%CI 1.49, 26.12, p=0.012); but less likely to smoke(OR=0.10 95%CI 0.02, 0.48, p=0.0039), or have active malignancy (OR= 0.11 95%CI 0.01, 0.73, p=0.0223).

We followed more than 70,000 participants in an ongoing cohort study, the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Infected and non-infected cohort participants registered presence of 22 different symptoms in March 2021. One year after the initial infection, 13 of 22 symptoms were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on relative risks between infected and uninfected subjects. For instance, 17.4% of SARS-CoV-2 infected cohort participants reported fatigue that persist 12 months after infection, compared to new occurrence of fatigue that had lasted less than 12 months in 3.8% of non-infected subjects (excess risk 13.6%). The adjusted relative risk for fatigue was 4.8 (95 % CI 3.5 to 6.7). Two main underlying factors explained 50% of the variance in the 13 symptoms. Brain fog, poor memory, dizziness, heart palpitations, and fatigue had high loadings on the first factor, while shortness-of breath and cough had high loadings on the second factor. Lack of taste and smell showed low to moderate correlation to other symptoms. Anxiety, depression and mood swings were not strongly related to COVID-19.

Social determinants of health (SDH), such as stigmatization, incarceration, and poverty, have been associated with increased exposure to COVID-19 and increased deaths. While vaccines and booster shots are available, it will take time to reach herd immunity, and it is unclear how long newly developed vaccines provide protection and how effective they are against emerging variants. Therefore, prevention methods recommended by the Centers for Disease and Control (CDC)i.e., testing, hand-washing, social distancing, contact tracing, vaccination and booster shots, and quarantineare essential to reduce the rates of COVID-19 in marginalized communities. This project will adapt and test evidence-based HIV interventions along the prevention and treatment cascade to help address COVID-19 prevention needs. METHODS: The study aims to (1) optimize an adaptive intervention that will increase rates of testing and adherence to New Jersey State COVID-19 recommendations (testing, social distancing, quarantine, hospitalization, contact tracing, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and booster shots) among high-risk populations and (2) identify predictors of testing completion and adherence to New Jersey recommendations. This study follows Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) principles to conduct a Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) with 670 COVID-19 medically/socially vulnerable people. Participants will be recruited using a variety of strategies including advertisements on social media, posting fliers in public places, street outreach, facility-based, and snowball sampling. Participants complete a baseline survey and are randomized to receive navigation services or an electronic brochure. They then complete a follow-up 7 days after baseline and are randomized again to either continue with their original assignment or switch to the other intervention or critical dialog or brief counseling. Participants then complete a 5-week post-baseline follow-up. Guided by the COVID-19 Continuum of Prevention, Care, and Treatment, the analysis will explore the factors associated with COVID-19 testing within 7 days of the intervention. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the protocol of the first study to use SMART following CBPR to adapt evidence-based HIV prevention interventions to COVID-19. The findings will inform the development of an effective and scalable adaptive intervention to increase COVID-19 testing and adherence to public health recommendations, including vaccination and booster shots, among a marginalized and difficult-to-engage population.

IRT is a useful tool that has been used mainly as a diagnostic method for various stress-causing pathologies, though recent suggestions indicate that it can be used to assess the block quality of certain body regions. In the field of anaesthesiology, IRT has been applied to brachial and epidural blocks, while in algology, changes in surface blood circulation associated with sympathetic activity have been investigated. Thermography has also been employed to complement pain level scales based on the facial expressions of patients in critical condition, or after surgery. In addition, it has been used as a tool in research designed to evaluate different surgical procedures in human medicine, as in the case of surgical burrs for placing dental implants, where IRT helps assess the degree of heating associated with bone devascularisation, reduction in vascular perfusion as a consequence of stroke, and changes in the autonomous nervous system, or the degree of vascular changes in flaps applied to burn patients. In veterinary medicine, thermography has brought several benefits for animals in terms of evaluating lesions, diseases, and surgical procedures.

A reflective narration of activity development leads to a discussion of the effects of activity design on student-teacher and student-student interactions. The intersection between these interactions serves as a foundation for analyzing their impact on the classroom community.

Recently, the genome region including the gene vgll3 has gained attention as a locus with a large effect on Atlantic salmon maturation timing, and recent studies on the vgll3 locus in salmon have indicated that its effect might be mediated through body condition and accumulation of adipose tissue. However, the cellular and physiological pathways leading from vgll3 genotype to phenotype are still unknown. Standard metabolic rate is a potentially important trait for resource acquisition and assimilation and we hypothesized that this trait, being a proxy for the maintenance energy expenditure of an individual, could be an important link in the pathway from vgll3 genotype to maturation timing phenotype. As a first step to studying links between vgll3 and the metabolic phenotype of Atlantic salmon, we measured the standard metabolic rate of 150 first-year Atlantic salmon juveniles of both sexes, originating from 14 different families with either late-maturing or early-maturing vgll3 genotypes. No significant difference in mass-adjusted standard metabolic rate was detected between individuals with different vgll3 genotypes, indicating that juvenile salmon of different vgll3 genotypes have similar maintenance energy requirements in the experimental conditions used and that the effects of vgll3 on body condition and maturation are not strongly related to maintenance energy expenditure in either sex at this life stage.","output":"Standard metabolic rate does not associate with age-at-maturity genotype in juvenile Atlantic salmon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Renal transplantation is the most successful therapy to improve survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Living donors have been used as an alternative to reduce the stay on the waiting list. Laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy has become the standard procedure for renal transplantation. Minimally invasive surgery involves less postoperative pain with less analgesic requirements allowing shorter hospital stay for the donor. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed demographic and intraoperative data and surgical complications for 46 patients who underwent laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy between March 2001 and March 2011. RESULTS Mean donor age was 41 years. Mean operative time was 170  45 minutes. The average cold ischemic time was 40 minutes and warm ischemic time was 26 minutes. Twenty-one patients were donors for pediatric receptors. Fourty patients underwent left laparoscopic nephrectomy, the other 6 patients underwent right laparoscopic nephrectomy due to vascular anatomic variant. Right laparoscopic nephrectomy was converted in 1 case (2.2%) due to renal vein laceration without donor morbidity and without compromise of graft function. Renal function at the second day post donor nephrectomy was measured using serum creatinine averaged 1.2 mg/dL with a mean increase of 0.4 mg/dL from baseline, with normalization after 30 days. No patient required blood transfusion, and there were no immediate surgical complications, infections, or mortality. One patient developed an incisional hernia in relation to the site of kidney removal. The mean hospital stay was 5  1 days. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic nephrectomy in our experience is a safe technique without postoperative morbidity or mortality.

The aim of this study was three-folded: to assess the prevalence of childrens vaccination against COVID-19, to explore parents attitudes towards childrens vaccination, and to discover the factors associated with parents hesitancy towards childrens vaccination in several countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Methods: : This study utilized a cross-sectional descriptive design. A sample of 3744 parents from eight countries, namely, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia (KSA), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was conveniently approached and surveyed using Google forms. The participants have responded to a 42-item questionnaire pertaining to socio-demographics, children vaccination status, knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, and attitudes towards vaccinating children and the vaccine itself. Results: : The prevalence of vaccinated children against COVID-19 was 32% as indicated by the parents. Concerning parents attitudes towards vaccines safety, about one third of participants (32.5%) believe that all vaccines are not safe. In the regression analysis, childrens vaccination was significantly correlated with parents age, education, occupation, parents previous COVID-19 infection, and their vaccination status. Participants aged 50 years and those aged 40-50 years had an odds ratio of 17.9 (OR=17.9, CI: 11.16-28.97) and 13.2 (OR=13.2, CI: 8.42-20.88);respectively, for vaccinating their children compared to those aged 18-29 years. Parents who had COVID-19 vaccine were about five folds more likely to vaccinate their children compared with parents who did not receive the vaccine (OR=4.9, CI: 3.12-7.70). The prevalence of childrens vaccination in the participating Arab countries is still not promising.

Since the risk of tick-borne disease varies with the tick species, tick identification is vitally important in assessing threats. Standard taxonomic approaches are time-consuming and require skilled microscopy. Computer vision may provide a tenable solution to this problem. The emerging field of computer vision has many practical applications already, such as medical image analyses, facial recognition, and object detection. This tool may also help with the identification of ticks. To train a computer vision model, a substantial number of images are required. In the present study, tick images were obtained from a tick passive surveillance program that receives ticks from public individuals, partnering agencies, or veterinary clinics. We developed a computer vision method to identify common tick species and our results indicate that this tool could provide accurate, affordable, and real-time solutions for discriminating tick species. It provides an alternative to the present tick identification strategies. ABSTRACT: A wide range of pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites can be transmitted by ticks and can cause diseases, such as Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Landscape and climate changes are driving the geographic range expansion of important tick species. The morphological identification of ticks is critical for the assessment of disease risk; however, this process is time-consuming, costly, and requires qualified taxonomic specialists. To address this issue, we constructed a tick identification tool that can differentiate the most encountered human-biting ticks, Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor variabilis, and Ixodes scapularis, by implementing artificial intelligence methods with deep learning algorithms. Many convolutional neural network (CNN) models (such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception) have been used for image recognition purposes but it is still a very limited application in the use of tick identification. Here, we describe the modified CNN-based models which were trained using a large-scale molecularly verified dataset to identify tick species. The best CNN model achieved a 99.5% accuracy on the test set. These results demonstrate that a computer vision system is a potential alternative tool to help in prescreening ticks for identification, an earlier diagnosis of disease risk, and, as such, could be a valuable resource for health professionals.","output":"A Computer Vision-Based Approach for Tick Identification Using Deep Learning Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are widely used as gene silencing tools and typically consist of a duplex stem of 19C29 bp, a loop, and often a dinucleotide overhang at the 3 end. Like siRNAs, shRNAs show promise as potential therapeutic agents due to their high level of specificity and potency, although effective delivery to target tissues remains a challenge. Algorithms used to predict siRNA performance are frequently used to design shRNAs as well. However, the differences between these two kinds of RNAi mediators indicate that the factors affecting target gene silencing will not be the same for siRNAs and shRNAs. Stem and loop lengths, structures of the termini, the identity of nucleotides adjacent to and near the loop, and the position of the guide (antisense) strand all affect the efficacy of shRNAs. In addition, shRNAs with 19-bp or shorter stem lengths are processed and function differently than those with longer stems. In this review, we describe studies of targeting the hepatitis C virus that have provided guidelines for an optimal design for short (19 bp) shRNAs (sshRNAs) that are highly potent, stable in biological fluids, and have minimal immunostimulatory properties.","output":"Design of Synthetic shRNAs for Targeting Hepatitis C: A New Approach to Antiviral Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Happiness is the foundation of a better life and a goal that people pursue; however, happiness levels among university students are low. The purpose of this study is to explore the main factors influencing student happiness. A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted in China in 2020. Data on student happiness was collected using the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire, and students personal, familial, and social information were obtained using another questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the association between student happiness and these factors in terms of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 2186 valid questionnaires were obtained. Firstly, student happiness was found to be associated with personal factors. The results found that happiness was significantly associated with state of health, the adjusted OR (95% CI) = 3.41 (2.01C5.79) for healthy students compared to unhealthy students, and that happiness decreased with the students age (OR = 0.79 and 95% CI = 0.63C0.98). Secondly, the research suggested that happiness was associated with familial factors. Both frequent contact with family and a harmonious relationship with parents significantly enhanced happiness with ORs (95% CIs) 1.42 (1.17C1.71) and 2.32 (1.83C2.95), respectively. Thirdly, student happiness was associated with several social factors. Students who performed well academically, who went to sleep early, and who were in a loving relationship were found to be happier than those with poor academic performance, went to sleep late, and who were single, for which the ORs (95% CIs) were, respectively, 1.87 (1.51C2.32), 1.50 (1.24C1.81), and 1.32 (1.09C1.60).

By the end of March 2021, more than 136 million patients have been infected. Since the second and third waves of the COVID-19 outbreak are in full swing, investigating effective and timely solutions for patients check-ups and treatment is important. Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test is recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the test results are prone to be false negative in the early course of COVID-19 infection. To enhance the screening efficiency and accessibility, chest images captured via X-ray or computed tomography (CT) provide valuable information when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. With advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, AI-driven models training with lung scans emerge as quick diagnostic and screening tools for detecting COVID-19 infection in patients. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art AI-empowered methods for computational examination of COVID-19 patients with lung scans. In this regard, we searched for papers and preprints on bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv published for the period from January 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, using the keywords of COVID, lung scans, and AI. After the quality screening, 96 studies are included in this review. The reviewed studies were grouped into three categories based on their target application scenarios: automatic detection of coronavirus disease, infection segmentation, and severity assessment and prognosis prediction. The latest AI solutions to process and analyze chest images for COVID-19 treatment and their advantages and limitations are presented. In addition to reviewing the rapidly developing techniques, we also summarize publicly accessible lung scan image sets.

Due to barriers such as limited access to care, half of the women with PPD do not receive treatment. Therefore, it is critical to identify effective and scalable interventions. Traditional mindfulness programs have been effective in reducing depressive symptoms, however access remains a barrier. A self-paced mobile health (mHealth) mindfulness program may fit the lifestyle of busy mothers who are unable to attend in-person classes. However, little is known regarding the feasibility or efficacy of mHealth mindfulness interventions in postpartum women with depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of an mHealth mindfulness intervention within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health care system. Participants were identified through clinician referral and electronic health records via KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program and recruited by the study team. Inclusion criteria included the following: English-speaking, up to 6 months postpartum with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) score of 10 to 19, and no regular mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to use a mindfulness app, Headspace, 10 to 20 min/day for 6 weeks. Baseline and postintervention surveys captured data on patient-reported outcomes (depression and stress symptoms, sleep quality, and mindfulness). Semistructured interviews captured acceptability. Retention and adherence were used to assess feasibility. RESULTS: Of the 115 women who were contacted and met the eligibility criteria or declined participation before eligibility assessment, 27 (23%) were enrolled. In addition, 70% (19/27) completed the study. The mean age of participants was 31 years (SD 5.2), 30% (8/27) were non-Hispanic White, and, on average, participants were 12.3 weeks postpartum (SD 5.7). Of the women who completed the study, 100% (19/19) used the Headspace app at least once, and nearly half (9/19, 47%) used the app on 50% of the days during the 6-week intervention period. Of the 16 participants who completed the postintervention interview, 69% (11/16) reported that they were very or extremely satisfied with the app. Interviews indicated that women appreciated the variety of meditations and felt that the program led to reduced anxiety and improved sleep. Significant improvements in pre- and postintervention scores were observed for depressive symptoms (PHQ-8: ?3.8, P=.004), perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale: ?6.0, P=.005), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: ?2.1, P=.02, indicating less sleep disturbance). Improvements in mindfulness were also significant (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form: 10.9, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: An mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms is feasible and acceptable.

In the present study, we explored the structural aspect of HomA and HomB proteins using various computational, biophysical and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. Interestingly, the in-silico analysis revealed that HomA/B consists of 8 discontinuous N and C terminal ?-strands forming a small ?-barrel, along with a large surface-exposed globular domain. Further, biophysical experiments suggested that HomA and HomB are dimeric and most likely the cysteine residues present on surface-exposed loops participate in protein-protein interactions.

Recent research on delivery of psychological services in hospices in the United Kingdom (UK) on a national level, including inequalities or variation in practice, is limited. A nationwide survey will highlight any differences in provision and in doing so help focus future research and inform best practice both within the UK, and internationally. The specific objectives of this survey are to (1) chart the types of psychological support available to adult patients in hospices in the UK in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence model; (2) explore how services are organised; and (3) gather service perspectives on adequacy of care, and facilitators and barriers to appropriate practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey emailed to adult hospices in the UK in NovemberCDecember 2019. One staff member involved in the delivery and/or organisation of psychological support was invited to participate per hospice. Of 193 invited hospices, 116 took part. RESULTS: Sixteen percent rated their hospice psychological service as wholly adequate. The majority reported that services can access specialist professionals, but many relied on external referrals. Barriers to best practice included funding and staff capacity; facilitators included clear referral structures, audit and appropriate needs and outcome assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Access to psychological professionals has improved since the last survey 15 years ago, but the majority of responders felt their overall service was not wholly adequate. Basic emotional support is largely felt to be sufficient, but our results indicate a need for improvements in access to more specialist care. Partnerships with external mental health services may be key.

A content analysis approach was used for the material. The results show that the use of digital tools amongst the studied Norwegian coaches and boxing clubs varied in frequency and form during the spring of 2020 (COVID-19 shutdown). For them, the most frequent use of digital instruments was to communicate internally and externally about the COVID-19 situation, national rules and guidelines. The material demonstrated that online training strategies varied between different constellations of three specific factors: (1) synchronized (live-streamed) online training and unsynchronized online training (at home training videos and programmes), (2) publicly published online training that was only accessible through digital registration, and (3) free online training and online training that was only available to paying members. For the athletes in the material, the most frequent content was social media posts for self-promotion purposes.

We investigated the relationship between socioeconomic determinants of health obtained from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings and COVID-19 incidence and mortality at the county level in Georgia. METHODS: We analyzed data on COVID-19 incidence and case-fatality rates (CFRs) from the Georgia Department of Public Health from March 1 through August 31, 2020. We used repeated measures generalized linear mixed models to determine differences over time in Georgia counties among quartile health rankings of health outcomes, health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. RESULTS: COVID-19 incidence per 100 000 population increased across all quartile county groups for all health rankings (range, 23.1-51.6 in May to 688.4-1062.0 in August). COVID-19 CFRs per 100 000 population peaked in April and May (range, 3312-6835) for all health rankings, declined in June and July (range, 827-5202), and increased again in August (range, 1877-3310). Peak CFRs occurred later in counties with low health rankings for health behavior and clinical care and in counties with high health rankings for social and economic factors and physical environment. All interactions between the health ranking quartile variables and month were significant (P < .001). County-level Gini indices were associated with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 incidence (P < .001) but not CFRs. CONCLUSIONS: From March through August 2020, COVID-19 incidence rose in Georgia's counties independent of health rankings categorization. Differences in time to peak CFRs differed at the county level based upon key health rankings.

IL-6 is produced by immune cells and is instrumental in the up-regulation of acute phase reactants and helper T cell differentiation needed for B lymphocyte and antibody production. Inhibitors of IL-6 may result in down-regulation of immunoglobulin formation, predisposing patients to superinfections. Tocilizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 receptor and is used in the management of rheumatologic diseases. More recently, tocilizumab has been used to treat patients with COVID-19. Based on results of retrospective cohort studies, tocilizumab may shorten time to clinical improvement and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV);however, the relationship between tocilizumab and development of secondary infections is uncertain due to limited and conflicting data. Our study aims to evaluate the use of tocilizumab in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who develop bacterial superinfections with or without bronchopleural fistulas (BPF). MethodsWe conducted a retrospective observational case series utilizing data from 50 patients admitted to the intensive care units at Lankenau Medical Center and Paoli Hospital, two large academic suburban hospitals. All patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 between February and July 2020 and received tocilizumab. ResultsTwenty-three (46%) patients who received tocilizumab developed secondary bacterial infections. Isolated organisms are outlined in Figure 1. The most common pathogens were MSSA and MRSA. Two of these patients developed a BPF. Of the 50 patients, 90% required invasive mechanical ventilation and 10% required non-invasive ventilation. Nine patients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Illness severity ranged from mild to severe ARDS. ConclusionDespite its theoretical benefits, exposure to tocilizumab may predispose certain individuals to secondary infections, which may induce structural damage and cellular death. In our study, 46% of patients developed confirmed bacterial infection after receiving tocilizumab. Two of these patients went on to develop a BPF. The results of our study are in contrast to the results recently published in the NEJM, which reported that 8.1% of patients developed serious infection after receiving tocilizumab. The increased rate of bacterial superinfections noted in our study population may be in part due to illness severity, as all of our patients were critically ill and most of them required IMV. Additional randomized controlled trials of critically ill patients with COVID-19 are needed to determine if treatment with tocilizumab is directly correlated with the development of secondary bacterial infections.","output":"Tocilizumab: Trick or treat in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with several changes in maintenance of children's dental health.

Thus, we aimed to investigate the electrocardiographic and mortality effects of CQ and HCQ in a primary care population. Methods: We used Danish health care registers and electrocardiograms (ECGs) from primary care to define three studies. 1) A paired study of subjects with ECGs before and during use of CQ/HCQ, 2) a matched ECG study of subjects taking CQ/HCQ compared to controls, and 3) a mortality study on people taking HCQ matched to control. In both matched studies, we adjusted for connective tissue diseases, use of QT-prolonging drugs, and cardiac disease. We used the QTc interval as the marker for electrocardiographic safety. In the mortality study, cases were followed from first claimed prescription until 300 days after estimated completion of the last prescription. 95% confidence intervals follow estimates in parenthesis. Results: Use of CQ was associated with a 5.5 (0.7;10) ms increase in QTc in the paired study (n=10).

In the online connected world possibilities for such communication have grown further, in particular with the opportunity that social media presents. As a consequence, communication strategies have become a key plank of responses to crises ranging from epidemics to terrorism to natural disaster. Such strategies involve a range of innovative practices on social media. Whilst being able to bring about positive effects, they can also bring about a range of harmful unintended side effects. This include economic harms produced by incorrect information and a range of social harms that can be fuelled by myths and rumours, worsening negative phenomena such as stigmatisation and discrimination. Given the potential for such harms, one might expect that affected or potentially affected individuals would be able to challenge such measures before courts or administrative tribunals. As this paper demonstrates however this is not the case. More often than not seemingly applicable legal approaches are unlikely to be able to engage such methods. This is often because such measures represent activities that are purely expressive in nature and therefore not capable of imposing any binding legal or corporeal changes on individuals. Whilst some forms of soft law may pose requirements for public officials involved in such activities (e.g. codes of conduct or of professional ethics), they are not likely to offer potentially harmed individuals the chance to to challenge particular communication strategies before courts or legal tribunals. The result is that public authorities largely have a free reign to communicate how they wish and do not have to have to comply with a range of requirements (e.g. relating to form and substantive) content) that would in general apply to most forms of official administrative act.","output":"Crisis Communication in Public Health Emergencies: The Limits of Legal Control and the Risks for Harmful Outcomes in a Digital Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During viral pandemics, filtering facepiece (FFP) masks together with eye protection form the essential components of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers. There remain concerns regarding insufficient global supply and imperfect protection offered by currently available PPE strategies. A range of full-face snorkel masks were adapted to accept high grade medical respiratory filters using bespoke-designed 3D-printed connectors. We compared the protection offered by the snorkel to that of standard PPE using a placebo-controlled respirator filtering test as well as a fluorescent droplet deposition experiment. Out of the 56 subjects tested, 42 (75%) passed filtering testing with the snorkel mask compared to 31 (55%) with a FFP3 respirator mask (p = 0.003). Amongst the 43 subjects who were not excluded following a placebo control, 85% passed filtering testing with the snorkel versus to 68% with a FFP3 mask (p = 0.008). Following front and lateral spray of fluorescence liquid particles, the snorkel mask also provided superior protection against droplet deposition within the subject's face, when compared to a standard PPE combination of FFP3 masks and eye protection (3.19x108 versus 6.81x108 fluorescence units, p<0.001).

It has been engaged since decades in active learning, especially problem-and project-based learning. During the last ten years, ISAE-Supmeca has gained experience in leading or participating in several French and European educational research projects. This led to the set-up of an Educational Innovation Unit, at the interface of teachers and learners. Among other tasks and in collaboration with teachers, this unit coordinates and participates in several educational research projects, maps issues encountered in the learning process, assists teachers and proposes new educational tools. As well as all scientific and technical higher education institutions, ISAE-Supmeca has been impacted by the covid-19 pandemic situation. The experience of problem-and project-based learning helped the institution and its actors to quickly adapt to a full remote education (online), then to a partly remote education (blended for some modules), but it was not without any issues. So, a follow-up with surveys and analysis took place in order to map the main issues, the solutions adopted and the evolution of the situation. The main goal of this data collection and analysis is to formalize feedback, extract results and then have grounds to better implement the mid-or long-term adaptations, i.e. carry out a three-phase work: reaction, analysis and action.

To date, however, there has been no report describing the regulation of JE progression using immunomodulatory tools for developing therapeutic strategies. We tested whether blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway would regulate JE progression using murine JE model. METHODS: Infected wild-type and 4-1BB-knockout (KO) mice were examined daily for mortality and clinical signs, and neuroinflammation in the CNS was evaluated by infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes and cytokine expression. In addition, viral burden, JEV-specific T cell, and type I/II IFN (IFN-I/II) innate responses were analyzed. RESULTS: Blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway significantly increased resistance to JE and reduced viral burden in extraneural tissues and the CNS, rather than causing a detrimental effect. In addition, treatment with 4-1BB agonistic antibody exacerbated JE. Furthermore, JE amelioration and reduction of viral burden by blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway were associated with an increased frequency of IFN-II-producing NK and CD4(+) Th1 cells as well as increased infiltration of mature Ly-6C(hi) monocytes in the inflamed CNS. More interestingly, DCs and macrophages derived from 4-1BB KO mice showed potent and rapid IFN-I innate immune responses upon JEV infection, which was coupled to strong induction of PRRs (RIG-I, MDA5), transcription factors (IRF7), and antiviral ISG genes (ISG49, ISG54, ISG56). Further, the ablation of 4-1BB signaling enhanced IFN-I innate responses in neuron cells, which likely regulated viral spread in the CNS. Finally, we confirmed that blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway in myeloid cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) played a dominant role in ameliorating JE. In support of this finding, HSC-derived leukocytes played a dominant role in generating the IFN-I innate responses in the host. CONCLUSIONS: Blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway ameliorates JE via divergent enhancement of IFN-II-producing NK and CD4(+) Th1 cells and mature Ly-6C(hi) monocyte infiltration, as well as an IFN-I innate response of myeloid-derived cells. Therefore, regulation of the 4-1BB signaling pathway with antibodies or inhibitors could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of JE.","output":"Amelioration of Japanese encephalitis by blockage of 4-1BB signaling is coupled to divergent enhancement of type I/II IFN responses and Ly-6C(hi) monocyte differentiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens and produces economic loss within the poultry industry.

Clinical findings on COVID-19 show that many patients had dangerously low blood oxygen levels not long before conditions worsened. It is therefore recommended, especially for the vulnerable population, to regularly monitor the blood oxygen level for precaution. Recent works have investigated how ubiquitous smartphone cameras can be used to infer SpO$_2$. Most of these works are contact-based, requiring users to cover a phone's camera and its nearby light source with a finger to capture reemitted light from the illuminated tissue. Contact-based methods may lead to skin irritation and sanitary concerns, especially during a pandemic. In this paper, we propose a noncontact method for SpO$_2$ monitoring using hand videos acquired by smartphones. Considering the optical broadband nature of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color channels of the smartphone cameras, we exploit all three channels of RGB sensing to distill the SpO$_2$ information beyond the traditional ratio-of-ratios (RoR) method that uses only two wavelengths. To further facilitate an accurate SpO$_2$ prediction, we design adaptive narrow bandpass filters based on accurately estimated heart rate to obtain the most cardiac-related AC component for each color channel. Experimental results show that our proposed blood oxygen estimation method can reach a mean absolute error of 1.26% when a pulse oximeter is used as a reference, outperforming the traditional RoR method by 25%.","output":"A Multi-Channel Ratio-of-Ratios Method for Noncontact Hand Video Based SpO$_2$ Monitoring Using Smartphone Cameras"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 has disrupted the economies of global leaders viz America and china and is spreading globally The first epicenter of this epidemic is Wuhan (where outbreak of corona happened), the capital of Central China's Hubei Province, so, the role of chinas financial health at this stage plays a vital role in global economy and so the Americas being world leader COVID-19 is probably the biggest health epidemic since SARS in 2003, the world has been affected and due to its outreach presence globally its no longer epidemic but considered as a Pandemic by WHO Apart from the obvious health impacts and human costs, the economy has been hit quite hard too The impact is so strong the almost every country is at lockdown and so their trade and commerce This research paper is guided through the global economic scenario but mainly focused to the impact of pandemic on the Indian Economy, Present and Future This paper will help to understand how different sectors of Indian industries are reacting to this situation and taking measures to minimize the loss or risk in this dire situation ? 2020 SERSC","output":"The economic cost of COVID-19: A potential pandemic impact on Indian economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus pandemic has affected more than 20 million people so far. Elevated cytokines and suppressed immune responses have been hypothesized to set off a cytokine storm, contributing to ARDS, multiple-organ failure and, in the most severe cases, death. We aimed to quantify the differences in the circulating levels of major inflammatory and immunological markers between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS and preprint servers. Risk of bias was assessed for each study, using appropriate checklists. All studies were described qualitatively and a subset was included in the meta-analysis, using forest plots. RESULTS: Based on 23 studies, mean cytokine levels were significantly higher (IL-6: MD, 19.55 pg/mL; CI, 14.80, 24.30; IL-8: MD, 19.18 pg/mL; CI, 2.94, 35.43; IL-10: MD, 3.66 pg/mL; CI, 2.41, 4.92; IL-2R: MD, 521.36 U/mL; CI, 87.15, 955.57; and TNF-alpha: MD, 1.11 pg/mL; CI, 0.07, 2.15) and T-lymphocyte levels were significantly lower (CD4+ T cells: MD, -165.28 cells/L; CI, -207.58, -122.97; CD8+ T cells: MD, -106.51 cells/L; CI, -128.59, -84.43) among severe cases as compared to nonsevere ones. There was heterogeneity across studies due to small sample sizes and nonuniformity in outcome assessment and varied definitions of disease severity. The overall quality of studies was sub-optimal. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 is characterized by significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced T lymphocytes.

The results show that the development of digital technology contributes to enhancing the efficiency of food safety supervision.

However, whether the combination of geldanamycin and licochalcone A-induced apoptosis in epithelial ovarian cancer cells is mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species, leading to the activation of apoptotic caspase, has not been studied. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using the human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3, we investigated the promoting effect of licochalcone A on geldanamycin-induced apoptosis. RESULTS Geldanamycin induced changes in apoptosis-related protein levels, loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases, cleavage of PARP-1, formation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of glutathione (GSH). Licochalcone A enhanced geldanamycin-induced apoptosis-related protein activation, formation of reactive oxygen species, caspase activation and cell death. The combined effect was inhibited by the addition of oxidant scavengers. CONCLUSIONS Licochalcone A may potentiate the apoptotic effect of geldanamycin on ovarian carcinoma cell lines by the activation of the caspase-8- and Bid-dependent pathways and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.

EXPOSURES: Social distancing, measured by percentage change in visits to nonessential businesses; population density; and daily wet-bulb temperatures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Instantaneous reproduction number (R(t)), or cases generated by each incident case at a given time, estimated from daily case incidence data. RESULTS: The 211 counties contained 178 892 208 of 326 289 971 US residents (54.8%). Median (interquartile range) population density was 1022.7 (471.2-1846.0) people per square mile. The mean (SD) peak reduction in visits to nonessential business between April 6 and April 19, as the country was sheltering in place, was 68.7% (7.9%). Median (interquartile range) daily wet-bulb temperatures were 7.5 (3.8-12.8) C. Median (interquartile range) case incidence and fatality rates per 100 000 people were approximately 10 times higher for the top decile of densely populated counties (1185.2 [313.2-1891.2] cases; 43.7 [10.4-106.7] deaths) than for counties in the lowest density quartile (121.4 [87.8-175.4] cases; 4.2 [1.9-8.0] deaths). Mean (SD) R(t) in the first 2 weeks was 5.7 (2.5) in the top decile compared with 3.1 (1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to nonessential businesses was associated with a 45% decrease in R(t) (95% CI, 43%-49%). From a relative R(t) at 0 C of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.89-2.40), relative R(t) decreased to a minimum as temperatures warmed to 11 C, increased between 11 and 20 C (1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84) and then declined again at temperatures greater than 20 C.

The virus has mutated in three major directions, resulting in three groups to date. Analysis of the basic structure of the group of viruses was completed by April and shared across all continents. However, the virus continued to mutate independently in each country after the borders were closed. In particular, the virus mutated before the occurrence of the second and subsequent peaks. It seems that the mutations conferred higher infectivity to the virus, because of which the virus overcame previously effective protection and caused second waves of the disease. Currently, each country may possess such a unique, stronger variant. Some of them slowly entered other countries and caused epidemics. These viruses could also serve as sources of further mutations by exchanging parts of the genome, which could create variants with superior infectivity.","output":"Progressing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dairy and poultry sectors responded quickly to the initial adjustments in the quantity and nature of food products forced by the shuttering of the hospitality sector and the subsequent switch to buying food from grocery stores.

The aim of this study was to examine trends of emergency department (ED) use by older people during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years. METHODS: The study site is a 1000-bed university teaching hospital with annual ED new-patient attendance of > 50,000. All ED presentations of patients aged  70 years from March to August 2020, 2019 and 2018 inclusive (n = 13,989) were reviewed and compared for presenting complaint, Manchester Triage Score, and admission/discharge decision. RESULTS: There was a 16% reduction in presentations across the 6 months in 2020 compared to the average of 2018/2019. On average, 4 fewer people aged  70 years presented to the ED per day in 2020. Much of this was concentrated in March (33% fewer presentations) and April (31% fewer presentations), when the country was in lockdown, i.e. non-essential journeys were banned. There was a 20% reduction in patients presenting with stroke and cardiac complaints. In the 3 months following easing of restrictions, there was a 25% increase in falls and orthopaedic injuries when compared to 2018/2019. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant decline in the number of older people presenting to the ED for unscheduled care, including for potentially time-dependent illnesses such as stroke or cardiac complaints.

Previous studies have shown that there are drug-to-drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and antidepressants. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment method was needed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological therapy in clinical treatment. Computerized CBT (cCBT) was proven to be an effective alternative to CBT and does not require face-to-face therapy between a therapist and the patient, which suited the COVID-19 pandemic response. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the cCBT program we developed in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We customized a cCBT program focused on improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19, and then, we assessed its effectiveness. Screening was based on symptoms of depression or anxiety for patients who scored 7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD(17)) or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A total of 252 patients with COVID-19 at five sites were randomized into two groups: cCBT + treatment as usual (TAU; n=126) and TAU without cCBT (n=126). The cCBT + TAU group received the cCBT intervention program for 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the HAMD(17) and HAMA scores. The secondary outcome measures were the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Assessments were carried out pre- and postintervention. The patients symptoms of anxiety and depression in one of the centers were assessed again within 1 month after the postintervention assessment. RESULTS: The cCBT + TAU group displayed a significantly decreased score on the HAMD(17), HAMA, SDS, SAS, and AIS after the intervention compared to the TAU group (all P<.001). A mixed-effects repeated measures model revealed significant improvement in symptoms of depression (HAMD(17) and SDS scores, both P<.001), anxiety (HAMA and SAS scores, both P<.001), and insomnia (AIS score, P=.002) during the postintervention and follow-up periods in the cCBT + TAU group. Additionally, the improvement of insomnia among females (P=.14) and those with middle school education (P=.48) in the cCBT + TAU group showed no significant differences when compared to the TAU group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the cCBT program we developed was an effective nonpharmacological treatment for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among patients with COVID-19. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects of cCBT for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in patients with COVID-19.

This case-control study investigates hearing and speech perception both in quiet and with background noise 30-years after CBCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS One-hundred-and-one patients (Cases) who received CBCT for testicular cancer between 1980 and 1994 were assessed with pure-tone audiometry (.125 - 8 kHz) and speech perception tests including hearing in noise test (HINT). Self-reported hearing and tinnitus was scored by participants. Results were compared with 30 age-matched controls. RESULTS The median age of Cases and Controls was 60 (46 - 83) and 61 years (51 - 74), respectively. The median observation time for Cases was 30 years (22 - 37). Compared with Controls, Cases had 8 and 19 dB worse age-adjusted high-frequency hearing at 6 and 8 kHz, respectively (p <.05), while thresholds at lower frequencies did not differ. All but four Cases reached 100% speech perception with basic speech audiometry. There was no difference between Cases and Controls in speech perception neither in quiet nor with both speech and background noise from the front, although the within-group variance was greater among Cases. Cases scored slightly worse with speech from front and noise from either side. Self-reported hearing loss (both hearing loss in general and specifically with background noise), and tinnitus were about three times more common among Cases compared with Controls. CONCLUSIONS Cisplatin causes high-frequency hearing loss, but speech perception tests performed both in quiet and in background noise 30 years post-treatment indicate that the clinical relevance is limited for most patients. Few patients develop severe hearing loss that requires rehabilitation but it is important to identify these patients.

Such a tax system, with universal character, is deduced from the following guiding principles: (1) a single tax rate applies to all income types and levels; (2) the tax rate adjusts to satisfy budget projections; (3) government transfer only supplements the income of households with self-generated income below the poverty line; (4) deductions for basic living expenses, itemized investments and capital losses are allowed; (5) deductions cannot be applied to government transfer. A general framework emerges with three parameters that determine a minimum allowed tax deduction, a maximum allowed itemized deduction, and a maximum deduction defined by income percentage. An income distribution that mimics the United States, and a series of log-normal distributions are considered to quantitatively compare detailed characteristics of this tax system to progressive and flat tax systems.

Their usability and acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction capability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality, first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications.

Demographic data and discharge diagnosis were documented for every patient. RESULTS: Of the 1,307 patients who were hospitalized during the study period, 444 (35.5%) were males with a mean (SD) age of 66.1  16.6 years. There was a 47 and 46% reduction in all-cause respiratory morbidity compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, respectively. The mean incidence rate for respiratory diseases during the study period was 21.4 admissions per day, and this rate was significantly lower than the rate during the same period in 2018 (40.8 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.525; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.491C0.562; p < 0.001) or the rate during 2019 (39.9 admissions per day; IRR, 0.537; 95% CI, 0.502C0.574; p < 0.001). The greatest reductions (%) in the number of daily admissions in 2020 were observed for sleep apnoea (87% vs. 2018 and 84% vs. 2019) followed by admissions for asthma (76% vs. 2018 and 79% vs. 2019) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60% vs. 2018 and 51% vs. 2019), while the lowest reductions were detected in hospitalizations for pulmonary embolism (6% vs. 2018 and 23% vs. 2019) followed by tuberculosis (25% vs. both 2018 and 2019).

Demand increase, delays in expanding the system, and a series of moderate to severe droughts occurred in Brazil over the last eight years have contributed to bringing the power system to its current state of low storage levels and intense dispatch of the thermal plants. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 hit the country hard and brought an abrupt reduction in energy demand, with persistent impacts expected for the coming years. On average, 7.5 GW or 9.7% reduction is expected for the next three years in power demand. To deal with the reduction in demand, a well-planned adaptation strategy is urgently needed. It is important to plan how to efficiently combine reduction of dispatching the most expensive thermal plants and recover water levels of reservoir storage and productivity in the complex hydrosystem with over 150 reservoirs. To determine the tradeoff and adaptation strategy, we use the HIDROTERM model, a nonlinear programming optimization model previously developed for planning the operation of the Brazilian hydrothermal system for analysis by comparing results with demand forecasts before and during the pandemic and under different hydrological scenarios. ?

In this study, indoor heat of structures wherein exposed people received Grady Emergency Services based care in Atlanta, GA, U.S., was measured from May to September 2016. METHOD: ology: In this case-control study, analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of indoor heat on the odds of 9-1-1 calls for diabetic (n = 90 cases) and separately, for respiratory (n = 126 cases), conditions versus heat-insensitive emergencies (n = 698 controls). Generalized Additive Models considered both linear and non-linear indoor heat and health outcome associations using thin-plate regression splines. RESULTS: Hotter and more humid indoor conditions were non-linearly associated with an increasing likelihood of receiving emergency care for complications of diabetes and severe respiratory distress. Higher heat indices were associated with increased odds of a diabetes (odds ratio for change from 30 to 31 C: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.08-1.16) or respiratory 9-1-1 medical call versus control (odds ratio for change from 34 to 35 C: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.09-1.28) call. Both diabetic and respiratory distress patients were more likely to be African-American and/or have comorbidities.

The oral, nasal, and pharyngeal cavities (ONP) contain lymphoid tissue and epithelium that are in contact with the amniotic fluid. The ability of the ONP epithelium and lymphoid tissue to initiate a FIR is unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine if FIR occurs after selective ONP exposure to LPS in fetal sheep. METHODS Using fetal recovery surgery, we isolated ONP from the fetal lung, GI tract, and amniotic fluid by tracheal and esophageal ligation and with an occlusive glove fitted over the snout. LPS (5 mg) or saline was infused with 24 h Alzet pumps secured in the oral cavity (n = 7-8/group). Animals were delivered 1 or 6 days after initiation of the LPS or saline infusions. RESULTS The ONP exposure to LPS had time-dependent systemic inflammatory effects with changes in WBC in cord blood, an increase in posterior mediastinal lymph node weight at 6 days, and pro-inflammatory mRNA responses in the fetal plasma, lung, and liver. Compared to controls, the expression of surfactant protein A mRNA increased 1 and 6 days after ONP exposure to LPS. CONCLUSION ONP exposure to LPS alone can induce a mild FIR with time-dependent inflammatory responses in remote fetal tissues not directly exposed to LPS.","output":"Oral, nasal and pharyngeal exposure to lipopolysaccharide causes a fetal inflammatory response in sheep."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career barriers persist for individuals from marginalized communities due to financial and educational inequality, unconscious bias, and other disadvantaging factors. To evaluate differences in plans and interests between historically underrepresented (UR) and well-represented (WR) groups, we surveyed more than 3000 undergraduates enrolled in chemistry courses. Survey responses showed all groups arrived on campus with similar interests in learning more about science research. Over the 4 years of college, WR students maintained their interest levels, but UR students did not, creating a widening gap between the groups.

One of the most effective ways to protect people from being infected by these diseases is through vaccination. However, due to various resource constraints, vaccinating all the people in a community is not practical. Therefore, targeted vaccination, which vaccinates a small group of people, is an alternative approach to contain infectious diseases. Since many infectious diseases spread among people by droplet transmission within a certain range, we deploy a wireless sensor system in a high school to collect contacts happened within the disease transmission distance. Based on the collected traces, a graph is constructed to model the disease propagation, and a new metric (called connectivity centrality) is presented to find the important nodes in the constructed graph for disease containment. Connectivity centrality considers both a nodes local and global effect to measure its importance in disease propagation. Centrality based algorithms are presented and further enhanced by exploiting the information of the known infected nodes, which can be detected during targeted vaccination.

Other posttranslational modifications of HSV1 glycoproteins (designated gB, gC, gD and gE) were related temporally to the discrete shifts in electrophoretic mobilities that signal acquisition of the O-linked oligosaccharides. Fatty acid acylation (principally of gE) could be detected just prior to the shifts, whereas conversion of high-mannosetype N-linked oligosaccharides to the complex type occurred coincident with the shifts. The addition of O-linked oligosaccharides did not occur in cells treated with the ionophore monensin or in a ricinresistant cell line defective in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides. We conclude that extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chains on HSV1 glycoproteins, and probably also attachment of the first O-linked sugars, occurs as a late posttranslational modification in the Golgi apparatus.","output":"O-linked oligosaccharides are acquired by herpes simplex virus glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The integration and evolution of implantable medical devices made of bioresorbable polymers and used for temporary biomedical applications are crucial criteria in the success of a therapy and means of follow-up after implantation are needed.

By comprehensively exploring the globin repertoire using sensitive computational analyses of sequences, structures, and genomes, we present the identification of the third family of non-heme binding globinsthe photoglobin. By conducting profile-based comparisons, clustering analyses, and structural modeling, we demonstrate that photoglobin is related to, but distinct from, the phycocyanin family. Photoglobin preserves a potential ligand-binding pocket, whose residue configuration closely resembles that of phycocyanin, indicating that photoglobin potentially binds to a comparable linear tetrapyrrole. By exploring the contextual information provided by the photoglobins domain architectures and gene-neighborhoods, we found that photoglobin is frequently associated with the B12-binding light sensor domain and many domains typical of prokaryotic signal transduction systems. Structural modeling using AlphaFold2 demonstrated that photoglobin and B12-binding domains form a structurally conserved hub among different domain architecture contexts. Based on these strong associations, we predict that the coupled photoglobin and B12-binding domains act as a light-sensing regulatory bundle, with each domain sensing different wavelengths of light resulting in switch-like regulation of downstream signaling effectors. Thus, based on the above lines of evidence, we present a distinct non-heme binding globin family and propose that it may define a new type of light sensor, by means of a linear tetrapyrrole, in complex prokaryotic signal transduction systems.","output":"Photoglobin, a distinct family of non-heme binding globins, defines a potential photosensor in prokaryotic signal transduction systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine breakthrough infections pose a vast challenge in the eradication of the COVID pandemic situation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented new challenges to the maintenance of this method of teaching which is very much dependent on in-person participation. As a result, dissection ceased in many institutions, with anatomy teaching being conducted online. The conviction that hands-on cadaveric dissection offers considerable benefits beyond the imparting of anatomical knowledge has led to the development of strategies to retain the practical element at the core of anatomy teaching. This paper describes the ways in which this has been achieved in the current academic year within a COVID-secure environment. A blended learning curriculum has provided students with both the opportunity for online interaction as well as in-person dissection classes which have become the highlight of the course for students.

In addition to respiratory infections, SARS\\\\COV\\\\2 has been shown to include cardiovascular (CV) complications, including myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome. Risk of severe complications from SARS\\\\COV\\\\2 in individuals with existing CV and metabolic disease has been shown to be increased. Evidence indicates SARS\\\\COV\\\\2 enters tissues via the angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and that the virus is primed and activated by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The goal of this study was to determine ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels in pre\\\\clinical swine models of heart failure (HF). We hypothesized sex, pressure\\\\overload, and comorbidities would increase ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels. A retrospective analysis was conducted in previously completed studies in our lab including: 1) Female, intact Ossabaw swine that were either lean control or western diet\\\\fed aortic\\\\banded (N=4\\\\5/group); 2) Female Yucatan mini\\\\swine subject to ovariectomy and/or aortic banding (N=5\\\\8/group); and 3) Sedentary and exercise trained male, intact Yucatan mini\\\\swine that were aortic banded. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were evaluated in the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), and coronary vasculature using qRT\\\\PCR. Linear regression analysis was used to determine differences between the following variables: pig species, sex hormones, aortic banding, comorbidities, exercise training, and tissue. Data was log\\\\transformed to meet linear regression assumptions. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were significantly influenced by sex, comorbidity, and tissue type. TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were also influenced by species and disease status. Specifically, ACE2 mRNA levels decreased 57.1% in the LV and increased 169.9% in the RV of males compared to coronary vessels in intact females. TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased in the LV and RV of males (1,218.6% and 5,479.8%, respectively) compared to coronary vessels in intact females. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased 344% and 453.4%, respectively, in the LV of Ossabaw swine fed a Western Diet compared to coronary vessels from Yucatan and Ossabaw swine without comorbidities. Species differences indicated TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased 449.2% in the RV and 498.6% in the LV in Yucatan mini\\\\swine compared to coronary vessels in Ossabaw swine. A 107.3% increase in TMPRSS2 mRNA level was observed in male swine without HF compared to female intact swine with HF highlighting the importance of sex and disease state. Exercise training did not impact ACE2 or TMPRSS2 mRNA levels irrespective of tissue. In conclusion, these results suggest differences in RV, LV and coronary mRNA levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are dependent upon sex and comorbidities.

In arid climates, evaluating the groundwater potential is critical, particularly because the only source of drinking water and irrigation for the community is groundwater. The objective of this report is to locate and identify probable groundwater basins in the upper Wadi Namous basin's Ain Sefra area. GIS and RS were used to evaluate the parameters of morphometry and to demarcate groundwater potential zones by using eight different influencing factors, viz., geology, rainfall, height, slope, land cover, land use, and lineaments density are all factors to consider. The analytical hierarchical process (AHP) was used to give weightages to the factors, and definitions within each attribute were sorted in order of priority for groundwater potentiality. The major findings of the research were the creation of groundwater-potential zones in the watershed. The hydrogeological zone of the basin was assessed as follows: very poor (0.56%), poor (26.41%), moderate (44.72%), good (25.22%), and very good (3.1%). The groundwater recharge potential zones are concentrated in low cretaceous locations, according to analytical data.

Moreover, the activity of commodity index investments gives evidence of the overall financialisation process. In addition, we employ wavelet entropy to assess the predictability of the time series under consideration at different frequencies. We find that some variables share a similar predictability structure with food and oil. These variables are the ones that move the most along with oil and food. We also introduce a novel measure, the Cross Wavelet Energy Entropy Measure (CWEEM), based on wavelet transformation and information entropy, with the aim of quantifying the intrinsic predictability of food and oil given demand from emerging economies, commodity index investments, financial stress, and global economic activity. The results show that these dynamics are best predicted by global economic activity at all frequencies and by demand from emerging economies and commodity index investments at high frequencies only.","output":"Wavelet analysis and energy-based measures for oil-food price relationship as a footprint of financialisation effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the article is to stimulate discussions about the necessity to improve the legal regulations that guarantee a proper public health policy, as well as to determine the balance between the level of restrictions that may be imposed by State in order to protect both, the public interest of health and the economic development.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region, Ethiopia. Ten zonal towns with high population density and mobility and 1239 participants were included in the study. OUTCOME MEASURE: A semistructured questionnaire was uploaded to SurveyCTO data collection system with security patterns. Mask usage was assessed by observation, while social distancing and handwashing were assessed by interview. Data were collected by health professionals who have Bachelor of Science degree and above and analysed using SPSS V.25. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: From 1239 individuals, about half, 657 (53%), of respondents were women and about two-thirds, 795 (64.2%), were married. Nearly 9 out of 10 (90.3%) and about 8 out of 10 (82.0%) respondents reported that they frequently wash hands with soap and/or use sanitiser and keep social distancing as means to prevent COVID-19, respectively. Less than three-fifths (57.8%) of respondents wore masks during the interview. In summary, about half (48.9%) of respondents were practising the three recommended methods (social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks). Sex, educational status, family size and overall knowledge about COVID-19 were associated with practising COVID-19 prevention measures. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 prevention practice was low as only about half of participants were practising social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks. Although awareness creation has been implemented through different forms of media, it should be strengthened in different local languages.

Rural exposure during undergraduate medical training is promising as a means for overcoming the shortage of physicians outside urban areas, but the effectiveness is widely unknown. This integrative review assesses the effects of rural placements during undergraduate medical training on graduates' likelihood to take up rural practice. Methods: The paper presents the results of a longitudinal review of the literature published in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and elsewhere on the measurable effects of rural placements and internships during medical training on the number of graduates in rural practice. Results: The combined database and hand search identified 38 suitable primary studies with rather heterogeneous interventions, endpoints and results, mostly cross-sectional and control studies. The analysis of the existing evidence exhibited predominantly positive but rather weak correlations between rural placements during undergraduate medical training and later rural practice. Beyond the initial scope, the review underpinned rural upbringing to be the strongest predictor for rural practice. Conclusions: This review confirms that rural exposure during undergraduate medical training to contributes to recruitment and retention in nonurban settings. It can play a role within a broader strategy for overcoming the shortage of rural practitioners. Rural placements during medical education turned out to be particularly effective for rural-entry students.

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay (multiplex-PCR) can detect dozens of pathogens simultaneously, greatly reducing turnaround time (TAT) and improving detection sensitivity. But as a double-edged sword, due to the high sensitivity of PCR, the type of respiratory specimens is critical to diagnosis. In this work, we performed a head-to-head comparison to evaluate the multiplex-PCR yields between two samples, sputum and flocked oropharyngeal swabs (OPS). METHODS: Eleven common respiratory pathogens were tested in hospitalized children< 13 years of age who met the criteria for lower respiratory tract infection by GeXP-based multiplex-PCR of paired OPS and sputum. RESULTS: From January to June 2018, 440 children with paired OPS and sputum were tested. The positive rate was 84% (369/440) for OPS and 88% (386/440) for sputum (p = .007). The frequency of detection of HRV, RSV, Influenza A virus, HMPV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, M. pneumoniae, coronavirus, bocavirus and C. pneumoniae in sputa was higher than that of OPSs (all p < .001). Both types of specimens had similarly very good kappa values for most of pathogens, except for Mycoplasma pneumonia ( = 0.61) and Chlamydia pneumoniae ( = 0.24). Additionally, 79.3% (349/440) of cases showed consistent results between the two types of samples, and they were significantly younger than patients with inconsistent results (p = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Flocked oropharyngeal swabs and sputum performed similarly for the detection of common respiratory pathogens in hospitalized children by multiplex-PCR, except for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Young patients are likely to have consistent results between the two specimens.

Previous investigations detected lower levels of the anti-hypertensive and pregnancy-related factor, placental growth factor (PlGF), in obese hypertensive pregnancies. Therefore, we examined whether obese hypertensive pregnant rats have reduced PlGF and whether increasing its levels by administering recombinant human (rh)PlGF reduces their blood pressure. METHODS We utilized a genetic model of obesity characterized to be heavier, hypertensive and fertile, namely rats having heterozygous deficiency of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R-def). RESULTS MC4R-def obese rats had lower circulating levels of PlGF than wild-type lean controls at gestational day 19. Also, assessment of the PlGF receptor, Flt-1, in the vasculature showed that its levels were reduced in aorta and kidney glomeruli but increased in small mesenteric arteries. Chronic intraperitoneal administration of rhPlGF from gestational day 13-19 significantly increased circulating PlGF levels in both obese and lean rats, but reduced blood pressure only in the obese pregnant group. The rhPlGF treatment did not alter maternal body and fat masses or circulating levels of the adipokines, leptin and adiponectin. In addition, this treatment did not impact average foetal weights but increased placental weights regardless of obese or lean pregnancy. CONCLUSION PlGF is reduced in MC4R-def obese hypertensive pregnant rats, which is similar to findings in obese hypertensive pregnant women, while increasing its levels with exogenous rhPlGF reduces their blood pressure.","output":"Administration of recombinant human placental growth factor decreases blood pressure in obese hypertensive pregnant rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate vascular changes in the early period after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and at 6-month follow-up.

All subjects underwent optical coherence tomography angiography using a 6a?a?6 macular protocol in the early period after hospital discharge and 6 months later. Foveal vessel density (VD) and parafoveal VD values were measured from 4 quadrants (superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal) of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP). The choriocapillaris (CC) flow area and the foveal avascular zone area also were measured. The OCTA measurements of the patient group were compared both between time points and with the control group at each time point. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients showed lower VD values than control subjects in all parafoveal quadrants of both the SCP (superior, pa?=a?0.01; inferior, pa?=a?0.048; nasal, pa?=a?0.003; temporal, pa?=a?0.048) and the DCP (superior, pa?=a?0.001; inferior, pa?=a?0.011; nasal, pa?=a?0.012; temporal, pa?=a?0.018) at the initial checkup and in all parafoveal quadrants of the SCP (superior, pa?=a?0.0001; inferior, pa?=a?0.007; nasal, pa?=a?0.001; temporal, pa?=a?0.017) and in 2 of the parafoveal quadrants of the DCP (superior, pa?=a?0.003; inferior, pa?=a?0.016) at 6-month follow-up.

In preclinical safety studies, pathologies of the respiratory system can be a result of an intercurrent disease or can be induced by systemically administered drugs.

A complex technology is developed to support the assessment of adverse effects of inhaled substances in rodent and nonrodent species, and the extrapolation of experimental findings to humans. The nasal chambers are the structures that are first to be subjected to the effects of inhaled substances, whether microorganisms or chemical substances. In rodents, the relatively small size of the nose and nasal sinuses facilitates a histological examination. Findings show that infectious agents cause inflammation in the nose and nasal sinuses, and this may be associated with inflammation in the conjunctiva, the middle ear, and the oral cavity. It has been observed that a particular response of the rodent nasal mucosa to some irritant substances, including pharmaceutical agents, is the formation of rounded eosinophilic inclusions in the cytoplasm of sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium, and to a lesser extent in respiratory and glandular epithelial cells.","output":"Respiratory Tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To analyze the biological effects of four base materials used for elevation of proximal subgingival margins on gingival epithelial cells.

To enhance multilingual care, the authors created a freely available web app, RadTranslate, that provides multilingual radiology examination instructions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of this intervention in radiology. METHODS: The device-agnostic web app leverages artificial intelligence text-to-speech technology to provide standardized, human-like spoken examination instructions in the patient's preferred language. Standardized phrases were collected from a consensus group consisting of technologists, radiologists, and ancillary staff members. RadTranslate was piloted in Spanish for chest radiography performed at a COVID-19 triage outpatient center that served a predominantly Spanish-speaking Latino community. Implementation included a tablet displaying the app in the chest radiography room. Imaging appointment duration was measured and compared between pre- and postimplementation groups. RESULTS: In the 63-day test period after launch, there were 1,267 app uses, with technologists voluntarily switching exclusively to RadTranslate for Spanish-speaking patients. The most used phrases were a general explanation of the examination (30% of total), followed by instructions to disrobe and remove any jewelry (12%). There was no significant difference in imaging appointment duration (11  7 and 12  3 min for standard of care vs RadTranslate, respectively), but variability was significantly lower when RadTranslate was used (P = .003).

However, as communicable diseases spread from individual to individual through underlying social networks, our approach utilizes network information to improve performance. Network grouping, which groups individuals by community, weakly dominates Dorfman testing in terms of the expected number of tests used. Network grouping's outperformance is determined by the strength of community structure in the network. When networks have strong community structure, network grouping achieves the lower bound for two-stage testing procedures. As an empirical example, we consider the scenario of a university testing its population for COVID-19. Using social network data from a Danish university, we demonstrate network grouping requires significantly fewer tests than Dorfman.

It is also the primary target of the protective and neutralizing antibody response in both natural infection and vaccination. GP is heavily glycosylated with up to 17 predicted N-linked sites, numerous O-linked glycans in its disordered mucin-like domain (MLD), and three predicted C-linked mannosylation sites. Glycosylation of GP is important for host cell attachment to cell-surface lectins, as well as GP stability and fusion activity. Moreover, it has been shown to shield GP from neutralizing activity of serum antibodies. Here, we use mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomics to profile the site-specific glycosylation patterns of ebolavirus GP. We detect up to 16 unique O-linked glycosylation sites in the mucin-like domain, as well as two O-linked sites in the head and glycan cap domains of the receptor-binding GP1 subunit. Multiple O-linked glycans are observed at the S/T residues of N-linked glycosylation sequons, suggesting possible crosstalk between the two types of modifications. We also confirmed the presence of C-mannosylation at W288 in the context of trimeric GP. We find heterogenous, complex N-linked glycosylation at the majority of predicted sites as expected. By contrast, the two conserved sites N257 and N563 are enriched in unprocessed high-mannose and hybrid glycans, suggesting a role in host-cell attachment via DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. We discuss our findings in the context of antibody recognition to show how glycans contribute to and restrict neutralization epitopes.

Frontline healthcare workers in COVID-19 hotspots have faced numerous challenges, including shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and difficulties acquiring clinical testing. The magnitude of the exposure of healthcare workers and the potential for asymptomatic transmission makes it critical to understand the incidence of infection in this population. To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers, we studied frontline staff working in the Montefiore Health System in New York City. All participants were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were tested by RT-qPCR and for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The medical, occupational, and COVID-19 exposure histories of participants were recorded via questionnaires. Of the 98 asymptomatic healthcare workers tested, 19 (19.4%) tested positive by RT-qPCR and/or ELISA. Within this group, four (4.1%) were RT-qPCR positive, and four (4.1%) were PCR and IgG positive. Notably, an additional 11 (11.2%) individuals were IgG positive without a positive PCR. Two PCR positive individuals subsequently developed COVID-19 symptoms, while all others remained asymptomatic at 2-week follow-up. These results indicate that there is considerable asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 within the healthcare workforce, despite current mitigation policies. Furthermore, presuming that asymptomatic staff are not carrying SARS-CoV-2 is inconsistent with our results, and this could result in amplified transmission within healthcare settings. Consequently, aggressive testing regiments, such as testing frontline healthcare workers on a regular, multi-modal basis, may be required to prevent further spread within the workforce and to patients.","output":"COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers: Serological Findings Supporting Routine Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 21st century has seen rapid enrollment in online courses and environmental and biological determinates, such as COVID-19, that challenge how universities respond to education.

METHODS: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were performed up until 28 November 2020. The exposure in this study was the diagnosis of delirium using clinically validated criteria. Delirium might be in-hospital, at admission, or both. The main outcome was mortality defined as clinically validated non-survivor/death. The effect estimates were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: A total of 3,868 patients from 9 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The percentage of patients with delirium was 27% [20%, 34%]. Every 1 mg/L increase in CRP was significantly associated with 1% increased delirium risk (OR 1.01 [1.00. 1.02], p=0.033).

The memory requirements of the current state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnosis systems are not suitable for embedded systems due to the required large memory size of these systems (e.g., hundreds of megabytes). Thus, the current work is motivated to design a similar system with minimal memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a diagnosis system using a Raspberry Pi Linux embedded system. First, local features are extracted using local binary pattern (LBP) algorithm.

This was most likely the first language of cellCcell communication during evolution, which existed before more specific intercellular crosstalk involving specific ligands and receptors emerged. ExMVs are involved in several processes in the body, including immune and coagulation responses, which are part of inflammation. In this review we will briefly highlight what is known about how ExMVs regulate the function of the cellular arm of innate immunity, including macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, and affect the soluble components of this system, which consists of the complement cascade (ComC) and soluble, circulating, pattern-recognition receptors (collectins, ficolins, and pentaxrins). These effects are direct, due to the fact that ExMVs affect the biological functions of innate immunity cells and may directly interact with soluble components of this system. Moreover, by activating coagulation proteases, ExMVs may also indirectly activate the ComC. In this review, we will use the term extracellular microvesicles (ExMVs) to refer to these small, spheroidal blebs of different sizes, which are surrounded by a membrane lipid layer. We will focus on the role of both ExMVs released during cell-surface membrane budding and smaller ExMVs, known as exosomes, which are derived from the budding of the endosomal membrane compartment.

METHODS: We studied two sampling sets (Set 1 and Set 2). Set 1 consisted of results of testing 3382 assays of out-patients and hospital patients (5-88 years old) with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia of yet undetermined aetiology. Set 2 contained results of 1204 assays of hospital patients (12-94 years old) with pneumonia and COVID-19 already diagnosed by molecular biological techniques in test laboratories. The results were collected in twelve Russian cities/provinces in time range 2 March C 5 May 2020. Assays were analysed for 10 bacterial, 15 viral, 2 fungal and 2 parasitic aetiological agents. RESULTS: In Set 1, 4.35% of total pneumonia cases were related to SARS-CoV-2, with substantially larger proportion (18.75%) of deaths of pneumonia with COVID-19 diagnosed. However, studying Set 2, we revealed that 52.82% patients in it were also positive for different typical and atypical aetiological agents usually causing pneumonia. 433 COVID-19 patients (35.96%) were tested positive for various bacterial aetiological agents, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae infections accounting for the majority of secondary pneumonia cases. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2, a low-pathogenic virus itself, becomes exceptionally dangerous if secondary bacterial pneumonia attacks a COVID-19 patient as a complication. An essential part of the severest complications and mortality associated with COVID-19 in Russia in March-May 2020, may be attributed to secondary bacterial pneumonia and to a much less extent viral co-infections. The problem of hospital-acquired bacterial infection is exceptionally urgent in treating SARS-CoV-2 patients.

METHODS: Consecutive 22 patients (39 hips) recovered from COVID-19 and presented with ONFH from November 2020 to October 2021 were included. All the patients received corticosteroids as a supportive treatment during COVID-19. Patients were classified into two types based on the type of presentation, namely classic ONFH and rapidly destructive coxarthrosis (RDC) depending on radiographs, MRI, inflammatory markers and hip aspiration findings. Harris hip score was used to evaluate the functional outcome before and after treatment. RESULTS: The mean time to diagnose of ONFH from the onset of hip symptoms was 39.3 days (range 10C90 days). The average duration of onset of hip symptoms after COVID 19 infection was 7.5 months (range 3 C 11 months). The average cumulative dose of methylprednisolone equivalent was 811 mg (range 200C2100 mg) and the average duration of steroid intake was 2.8 weeks. There was significant elevation in the inflammatory markers in RDC group compared to classic ONFH (p < 0.05). The Harris hip score improved from 63.6  23.2 at presentation to 82.6  9.6 after treatment (p < 0.05). Three patients had features of RDC. Among the three patients with RDC, two patients had rapid progression of ONFH and underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA). The third patient is awaiting a THA. CONCLUSION: ONFH after COVID-19 can have a varied presentation. While the most common presentation is like classical ONFH, some patients can have an acute and aggressive presentation with rapid destruction. They have features like elevated serological markers and extensive periarticular bone and soft tissue edema.

Patients with poor acoustic window (n=11) were excluded. Clinical, imaging, laboratory and TTE findings were compared in patients with versus without PH (estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure >35 mm Hg) and with versus without RVD (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <17 mm or S wave <9.5 cm/s). The primary endpoint was in-hospital death or ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were included in the final analysis (median age 62 (IQR 52C74) years, 65.5% men). The prevalence of PH and RVD was 12.0% (24/200) and 14.5% (29/200), respectively. Patients with PH were older and had a higher burden of pre-existing cardiac comorbidities and signs of more severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (radiological lung involvement, laboratory findings and oxygenation status) compared with those without PH. Conversely, patients with RVD had a higher burden of pre-existing cardiac comorbidities but no evidence of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those without RVD.

The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of psychological interventions for individuals and/or couples seeking fertility to treat anxiety, depression, distress, quality of life and relationship satisfaction, as well as improve pregnancy rates. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The search strategy will involve 11 databases, including MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (OVID), The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) with Full Text (EBSCO), Social Work Abstracts (EBSCO), SocINDEX with Full Text (EBSCO), Academic Search Complete (EBSCO), Family & Society Studies Worldwide (EBSCO), Family Studies Abstracts (EBSCO) and Scopus. These databases will be searched from their inception to September 2019. Independent reviewers will search peer-reviewed published studies through electronic databases and additional sources, will extract the data and assess the methodological quality. Random-effects meta-analysis will be carried out by calculating effect sizes as Cohen's d indices. Heterogeneity will be examined by the I2 and the Q statistics. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The current review does not require ethics approval. The results will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals.

Its widespread manifestations and vascular complications are increasingly being reported even in young and middle-aged patients. Hyperinflammation is a continuum of host's exaggerated inflammatory response representing cytokine dysregulation/storm which produces coagulopathy and vascular endothelial dysfunction, apart from a prothrombotic state. Cytokine storm or direct viral invasion of the vascular endothelial cells through surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors may result in endothelial dysfunction which can potentially result in dissection. Only a few case reports have been published in the literature describing vascular dissection without any inciting factors in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we present the first case report of bilateral renal artery dissection in a 41-year-old male patient who recently recovered from COVID-19 and was managed successfully in stages after many medical hurdles.","output":"Spontaneous Renal Artery Dissection in COVID-19 Pneumonia: Potential Danger of Cytokine Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify what motivates medical students to join a pandemic emergency healthcare workforce. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Aalborg University, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All medical students. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Motivational points as perceived by the students to be important. Demographic characteristics and 11 motivational domains scored on a Visual Analog Scale from 0 (low) to 100 (high) responding to the question: To what degree are the following statements important for you to join a national emergency preparedness workforce? The questionnaire was developed by an expert panel in a process of four iterations. RESULTS: A total of 486 students of 688 (70.6%) completed the survey within 7 days in March 2020. 80% had decided to join the pandemic emergency healthcare workforce. Ranked median scores for motivational statements in each domain were: care, 100; learn, 90; pride, 83; team, 77; needed, 75; safety, 75; supervision, 75; job, 73; duty, 66; salary, 62; historic, 50. Supervision (p<0.001), salary (p<0.001) and duty (p=0.001) were given increasing priority with advancing study years.

Mammalian two-pore channels (TPCs) appear to be cornerstones of these processes in endo-lysosomes by controlling delicate ion-concentrations in their interiors. With evolutionary remarkable architecture and one-of-a-kind selectivity filter, TPCs are an extremely attractive topic per se. In the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, hTPC2 emerges to be more than attractive. As a key regulator of the endocytosis pathway, it is potentially essential for diverse viral infections in humans, as demonstrated. Here, by means of multiscale molecular simulations, we propose a model of sodium transport from the lumen to the cytosol where the central cavity works as a reservoir. Since the inhibition of hTPC2 is proven to stop SARS-CoV2 in vitro, shedding light on the hTPC2 function and mechanism is the first step towards the selection of potential inhibiting candidates.","output":"The key role of the central cavity in sodium transport through ligand-gated two-pore channels."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Delayed revascularisation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study is to investigate how the timeline in STEMI treatment was affected during the Covid-19 outbreak. METHOD: Consecutive 165 STEMI patients were enrolled in the study during the Covid-19 pandemic period (Pandemic period) and the prepandemic period (Control period). The time period until patients' leaving their current position after the onset of pain (home delay), the time from the onset of pain to the first medical contact (FMC delay), door-to-balloon time, procedure time and hospitalisation time were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients, 82 in the Pandemic period and 83 in the Control period, were included in the study. When compared with the control period, home delay [30 (5-6912) minutes vs 165 (10-360) minutes, P < .001] and FMC delay [61 (20-6932) minutes vs 190 (15-3660) minutes, P < .001] were significantly prolonged during the pandemic period.

Although numerous case reports exist, the findings appear heterogenous and providing accurate patient counselling remains challenging. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidance1 . RESULTS Thirty-one studies including 78 patients were included in this review. No association with maternal or neonatal coagulopathy, infection or trauma was found. The average gestational age at diagnosis was 25 weeks (range 17-34 weeks). Approximately half of foetuses affected were female (48.7%); one quarter were male (25.6%) and one quarter had no sex stated (25.6%). Termination of pregnancy was chosen in 25.6% of cases (20/78). In continuing pregnancies,10.3% (6/58) experienced a perinatal death. Antenatally, the majority of lesions either decreased in size (38.5%) or completely resolved (32.7%). The neonatal or childhood outcome was normal in 88.0% of survivors (44/50). The average age at follow up was 16.4 months, ranging from birth to 6 years. CONCLUSION This review found that ten percent of DST cases experience in-utero or neonatal death. In survivors, the majority of cases reduce in size or completely resolve in pregnancy and 85% are reported to have a good outcome.

However, a major limitation in establishing such associations is to adequately account for complex disease dynamics, influenced by e.g. significant differences in control measures and testing policies. Another difficulty is appropriately controlling the effects of other potentially important factors, due to both their mutual correlations and a limited dataset. To overcome these difficulties, we will here use the basic reproduction number (R0) that we estimate for USA states using non-linear dynamics methods. To account for a large number of predictors (many of which are mutually strongly correlated), combined with a limited dataset, we employ machine-learning methods. Specifically, to reduce dimensionality without complicating the variable interpretation, we employ Principal Component Analysis on subsets of mutually related (and correlated) predictors. Methods that allow feature (predictor) selection, and ranking their importance, are then used, including both linear regressions with regularization and feature selection (Lasso and Elastic Net) and non-parametric methods based on ensembles of weak-learners (Random Forest and Gradient Boost). Through these substantially different approaches, we robustly obtain that PM2.5 is a major predictor of R0 in USA states, with corrections from factors such as other pollutants, prosperity measures, population density, chronic disease levels, and possibly racial composition. As a rough magnitude estimate, we obtain that a relative change in R0, with variations in pollution levels observed in the USA, is typically ~30%, which further underscores the importance of pollution in COVID-19 transmissibility.","output":"PM2.5 as a major predictor of COVID-19 basic reproduction number in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the role of psychological inflexibility in the relationship between anxiety and depression and emotional eating in a sample of 123 inpatient Italian adult individuals with obesity.

Therefore, searching for more effective compounds to reduce the toxicity of treatments, while still producing similar effects as current chemotherapy regimens, is required. Currently, the search for potential anticancer agents involves a random, inaccurate process with strategic deficits and a lack of specific targets. For this reason, the initial in vitro high-throughput steps in the screening process should be reviewed for rapid identification of the compounds that may serve as anticancer agents. The present study aimed to investigate the potential use of the Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168H expressing DNA topoisomerase I (SMD1168H-TOPOI) in a yeast-based assay for screening potential anticancer agents. The cell density that indicated the growth of the recombinant yeast without treatment was first measured by spectrophotometry. Subsequently, the effects of glutamate (agonist) and camptothecin (antagonist) on the recombinant yeast cell density were investigated using the same approach, and finally, the effect of camptothecin on various cell lines was determined and compared with its effect on recombinant yeast. The current study demonstrated that growth was enhanced in SMD1168H-TOPOI as compared with that in SMD1168H. Glutamate also enhanced the growth of the SMD1168H; however, the growth effect was not enhanced in SMD1168H-TOPOI treated with glutamate. By contrast, camptothecin caused only lower cell density and growth throughout the treatment of SMD1168H-TOPOI. The findings of the current study indicated that SMD1168H-TOPOI has similar characteristics to MDA-MB-231 cells; therefore, it can be used in a yeast-based assay to screen for more effective compounds that may inhibit the growth of highly metastatic breast cancer cells.","output":"Potential use of Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168H expressing DNA topoisomerase I in the screening of potential anti-breast cancer agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, mainly causes alterations in the respiratory system. In severely ill patients, the disease often evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome that can predispose patients to a state of hypercoagulability, with thrombosis at both venous and arterial levels. This predisposition presents a multifactorial physiopathology, related to hypoxia as well as to the severe inflammatory process linked to this pathology, including the additional thrombotic factors present in many of the patients. In view of the need to optimise the management of hypercoagulability, the working groups of the Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology-Resuscitation and Pain Therapy (SEDAR) and of Intensive, Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC) have developed a consensus to establish guidelines for actions to be taken against alterations in haemostasis observed in severely ill patients with COVID-19.

As such, certain groups are suggested to be prioritized for vaccination to protect the most vulnerable before vaccinating others. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to determine an optimal and equitable allocation of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines that will minimize the projected number of additional COVID-19 deaths while satisfying the priority groups for immediate vaccination. METHODS: In this study, a linear programming model is formulated to determine an allocation of vaccines such that COVID-19 deaths are minimized while the prioritization framework set by the government is satisfied. Data used were collected up to November 2020. Total vaccine supply, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine cost, and projected deaths are analyzed. Results of the model are also compared to other allocation approaches. RESULTS: Results of the model show that a vaccine coverage of around 60C70% of the population can be enough for a community with limited supplies, and an increase in vaccine supply is beneficial if the initial coverage is less than the specified target range. Additionally, among the vaccines considered in the study, the one with 89.9% effectiveness and a 183 Philippine peso price per dose projected the lowest number of deaths. Compared with other model variations and common allocation approaches, the model has achieved both an optimal and equitable allocation. CONCLUSIONS: Having a 100% coverage for vaccination with a 100% effectiveness rate of vaccine is ideal for all countries. However, some countries have limited resources. Therefore, the results of our study can be used by policymakers to determine an optimal and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines for a country/community.

Simultaneous observation of hundreds of single-membrane channels yields statistical information revealing population heterogeneities of the pore assembly and conductance of the bacterial toxin -hemolysin (HL). The influence of lipid composition and ionic strength on HL pore formation was investigated at the single-channel level, resolving features of the pore-assembly pathway. Pore formation is inhibited by a specific antibody, demonstrating the applicability of the platform for drug screening of bacterial toxins and cell-penetrating agents. Furthermore, fusion of H3N2 influenza viruses with suspended lipid bilayers can be observed directly using a specialized chip architecture.

Here, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis mapped antibody epitopes in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (n = 86) experiencing a wide range of disease states. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), requirement for ventilators, or death. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within 6 days post-symptom onset and sometimes within 1 day. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate with various comorbidities and hallmarks of immune hyperactivity. We introduce a simple-to-calculate, disease risk factor score to quantitate each patient's comorbidities and age. For patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies, scores above 3.0 predict more severe disease outcomes with a 13.42 likelihood ratio (96.7% specificity). The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 prognostic to allow early identification and triage of high-risk patients. Such information could guide more effective therapeutic intervention.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over two million deaths worldwide. Despite efforts to fight the virus, the disease continues to overwhelm hospitals with severely ill patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is readily accomplished through a multitude of reliable testing platforms; however, prognostic prediction remains elusive. To this end, we identified a short epitope from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and also a disease risk factor score based upon comorbidities and age. The presence of antibodies specifically binding to this epitope plus a score cutoff can predict severe COVID-19 outcomes with 96.7% specificity.","output":"Predicting COVID-19 Severity with a Specific Nucleocapsid Antibody plus Disease Risk Factor Score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonotic coronavirus disease (COVID) has emerged in the past two decades and caused a pandemic that has produced a significant universal health alarm. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively, provoking severe lower respiratory infection and deadly pneumonia. COVID-19 is a severe respiratory disease caused by the new strain of novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2). The zoonotic aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highlighted in this article. COVID-19 has rapidly become a pandemic and has spread and infected millions of people worldwide. As of November 19, 2020, the date of submitting this review, the total CoV cases, deaths, and recovered patients are 56,828,218, 1,359,320, and 39,548,923, respectively. In conclusion, COVID-19 has particularly altered the opinion of the significance of zoonotic diseases and their animal origins and the intermediate reservoirs, which may be unknown wild animals. Genetically, the SARS-CoV-2 is related to the SARS-like bat CoVs and shares 85% identity with the SARS-CoV that is derived from the SARS-like bat CoVs. However, the virus is related to a lesser extent to the MERS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor-binding domain receptor of the SARS-CoV C the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; conversely, DPP4 (CD26).

The lockdown disrupted the employment and practices of many journalists in ways that may reveal the contemporary tensions between professional identity and working conditions more clearly than in average news cycles. In order to understand what the Belgian French-speaking journalists went through during the first lockdown, we conducted a survey about the implications of the crisis for their employment status and work practices. This survey also covered their perceptions concerning their social role, their journalistic skills and the quality of their work covering the COVID-19 crisis. The responses show a sharp contrast between challenging working conditions (isolation, lack of expertise and job losses in worst cases) and the satisfaction that comes from the social contribution of their reporting. In order to interpret the results, we consider the theory of valuation as a framework to understand the attachment of journalists to their work and how they practise it.

Methods: Patients 18 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as positive RT-PCR from nasal/oropharyngeal swab or positive serology, admitted at L. Spallanzani Institute (Italy) were included. Primary endpoint: time to invasive ventilation/death. Secondary endpoints: time to ventilation/death, time to symptoms resolution (resolution of fever or waning from oxygen). In order to control for measured confounders, Cox regression model was used. Results: A total of 905 hospitalized patients were included in the analysis (22 [2.4%] PLWH, 883 non-PLWH): 65% males, 66% with at least one comorbidity, median PaO2/FiO2 at admission 343 mmHg (260-405). PLWH were slightly younger (56 vs 62 years, p=0.057), less likely with pneumonia (59% vs 87%, p&lt;0.001) and with PaO2/FiO2 &lt;300 mmHg at admission (10% vs 31%, p=0.088), with less alterations in lymphocytes (1505 cells/mm vs 1170, p=0.025) and D-dimer (473 ng/mL vs 661, p=0.015) compared with non-PLWH. Symptoms at presentation were similar in the two groups apart from headache and myalgia that were more frequent in PLWH (both p&lt;0.001). Among PLWH, nadir CD4 was 80 (33-284) cells/l, CD4 at COVID19 diagnosis 350 cells/l (138-515), all of them were on antiretroviral therapy and 94% had HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL. The cumulative probability of invasive ventilation/death at day 14 was 9.1% (95% CI 2.4-31.7) in PLWH versus 14.7% (12.3-17.6) in non-PLWH (p=0.492). The cumulative probability of non-invasive or invasive ventilation/ death at day 14 was 14.3% (4.8-38.0) in PLWH versus 24.4% (21.4-27.8) in non-PLWH (p=0.372). Following adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities, PaO2/FiO2 and pneumonia at admission, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of mechanical ventilation/death of PLWH was 0.95 (95% CI 0.13-6.98, p=0.958) versus non-PLWH;similarly, aHR of non-invasive or invasive ventilation/death of PLWH was 1.05 (95% CI 0.26-4.28, p=0.947).

In this Symposium, we review how different hospitals are approaching the development and implementation of standardized approaches to the evaluation and management of pediatric agitation. Methods: Ruth Gerson, MD, will review national consensus practice guidelines (Baby BETA guidelines), supported by the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry, for the evaluation and treatment of youth at risk for or exhibiting agitation/aggression in the emergency setting. Nasuh Malas, MD, MPH, will discuss the systems issues with the application of agitation/aggression interventions across the health system at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. Alba Pergjika, MD, will present data on the implementation of agitation pathways at Lurie Childrens Hospital of Chicago. Ema Saito, MD, will review evidence-based as-needed (PRN) use to manage agitation in the pediatric population and will present data on PRN use in an acute-care adolescent inpatient unit at the Zucker Hillside Hospital in New York. Vera Feuer, MD, will discuss agitation management in special populations and pandemic-related care delivery modifications. Results: We will describe the only existing national consensus guidelines for pediatric agitation management in emergency settings and the diverse applications of these principles in clear models across different hospital settings. Dr. Malas will present systems data relevant to the development of systemic work in the management of agitation in the hospital setting. Dr. Pergjika will present data on the impact of a standardized pharmacological response to agitation in the emergency department (ED). Dr. Saito will present data on PRN inpatient psychiatry medication use. Conclusions: Pediatric agitation is common and highly problematic, and it results in significant distress for patients, families, and providers. Feasible and sustainable expert consensus guidelines for the management of agitation in the ED can be beneficial for hospital systems, and they require a multimodal approach for implementation.

With the confident identification of these landmarks, radiographs could provide more assistance in preoperative evaluations, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative assessments. PURPOSE To quantify the radiographic locations of endoscopic landmarks of the proximal femur. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS Ten cadaveric specimens were dissected, and radio-opaque hardware was placed for each landmark of interest. Radiographs were obtained and measurements recorded in anteroposterior (AP) and Dunn 45 views. RESULTS In the AP view, the gluteus medius insertion was located a mean 12.9  2.4 mm and 34.7  5.1 mm from the piriformis fossa and vastus tubercle, respectively. The piriformis fossa was a mean 14.8  5.9 mm and 4.9  1.9 mm from the anterior and posterior tips of the greater trochanter, respectively. The anterior and posterior tips of the greater trochanter were a mean 14.8  5.1 mm from each other. In the Dunn 45 view, the piriformis fossa was a mean 13.3  2.0 mm, and the vastus tubercle was a mean 21.5  6.0 mm, from the gluteus medius insertion. Moreover, the vastus tubercle was a mean 33.5  6.4 mm from the anterior tip of the greater trochanter and 31.6  8.5 mm from the posterior tip of the greater trochanter.

Meanwhile, Latino vaccination rates remain lower than those of non-Hispanic Whites. COVID-19 vaccine nonintent, defined as intent not to vaccinate for COVID-19, among Latino individuals continues to be an issue in the state of California. MethodsFamilies from three Latino longitudinal mother child cohorts previously recruited in the San Francisco Bay Area were surveyed telephonically from February to July 2021 to assess attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and prior vaccination, in general, for themselves and their children. Risk for vaccine nonintent was assessed using Mann-Whitney rank sum non-parametric test for continuous predictors and chi-squared tests for categorical ones. ResultsThree hundred and eighteen families were surveyed from the Telomere at Birth (TAB), Hispanic Eating and Nutrition (HEN) and Latino Eating and Diabetes Cohort (LEAD). Approximately 36% from TAB and 28% from HEN/LEAD indicated COVID-19 vaccine nonintent for themselves and/or their children. Risk factors for vaccine nonintent included lower maternal age (p=0.01), concern about vaccine side effects (p<0.01) and prior history of a household members being infected with COVID-19 (p<0.01) and indexes of household crowding including number of people sharing a bathroom (p=0.048). Vaccine intent was also associated with receiving vaccine input from friends (p=0.03), family (p<0.01) and/or coworkers (p=0.02) compared with those who were not planning on getting COVID-19 vaccination. It is possible that those with non-intent have received limited input from families, friends and/or coworkers.

The infection due to this virus spread exponentially throughout China and then spread across >205 nations, including the United States (US). Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are routinely performed in the US and globally. Previous reports of isolated infection outbreaks were reported with endoscopes acting as potential vectors. While multidrug\\\\resistant organisms have been reported to be spread by endoscopes, few cases of viruses such as Hepatitis B and C are noted in the literature.

It typically occurs in the third trimester and is a life-threatening condition for both the pregnant mother and the fetus if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Drug-induced PPP has been reported in sporadic case reports. Here we present a case of first-trimester PPP occurring after applying drugs including chloroquine, which we consider a possible culprit triggering the disease. CASE REPORT: A 29-year-old female was admitted to our department at 45 days gestation with sudden onset of fever and widespread erythematous pustules for 9 days. She had been on medications including hydroxychloroquine before onset. The eruptions and systemic symptoms were controlled with high-dose systemic steroids; however, she was detected to have a stillbirth, and underwent dilation and curettage of the uterine. At the latest follow-up about 2 years after her admission, she reported to have delivered a healthy baby about 1 month previously.

We aim to examine the relationship between exposure to and trust in COVID-19 news (from Television, social media, interpersonal communication) and information sources (healthcare experts, government, clerics) and belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, as well as critical verification practices before posting on social media. METHODS: We use a cross-sectional researcher-administered phone survey of adults living in Lebanon between March 27 and April 23, 2020. RESULTS: The sample included 56.1% men and 43.9% women, 37.9% with a university degree, 63.0% older than 30, and 7% with media literacy training. Those who trust COVID-19 news from social media [95%CI:(1.05-1.52)] and interpersonal communication [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)], and those who trust information from clerics [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)] were more likely to believe in COVID-19 myths and false information. University graduates [95%CI:(0.25-0.51)] and those who trust information from government [95%CI:(0.65-0.89] were less likely to believe in myths and false information. Those who believe in COVID-19 myths and false information [95%CI:(0.25-0.70)] were less likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. Only those who underwent media literacy training [95%CI:(1.24-6.55)] were more likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. CONCLUSION: Higher education and trust in information from government contributed to decreasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information. Trust in news from social media, interpersonal communication and clerics contributed to increasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, which in turn contributed to less critical social media posting practices, thereby exacerbated the infodemic.

We compared postoperative outcomes in breast, colorectal, and gastric cancer surgery in hospitals worldwide, focusing on the effect of disease stage and complications on postoperative mortality. METHODS: This was a multicentre, international prospective cohort study of consecutive adult patients undergoing surgery for primary breast, colorectal, or gastric cancer requiring a skin incision done under general or neuraxial anaesthesia. The primary outcome was death or major complication within 30 days of surgery. Multilevel logistic regression determined relationships within three-level nested models of patients within hospitals and countries. Hospital-level infrastructure effects were explored with three-way mediation analyses. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03471494. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2019, we enrolled 15 958 patients from 428 hospitals in 82 countries (high income 9106 patients, 31 countries; upper-middle income 2721 patients, 23 countries; or lower-middle income 4131 patients, 28 countries). Patients in LMICs presented with more advanced disease compared with patients in high-income countries. 30-day mortality was higher for gastric cancer in low-income or lower-middle-income countries (adjusted odds ratio 372, 95% CI 170C816) and for colorectal cancer in low-income or lower-middle-income countries (459, 239C880) and upper-middle-income countries (206, 111C383). No difference in 30-day mortality was seen in breast cancer. The proportion of patients who died after a major complication was greatest in low-income or lower-middle-income countries (615, 326C1159) and upper-middle-income countries (389, 208C729). Postoperative death after complications was partly explained by patient factors (60%) and partly by hospital or country (40%). The absence of consistently available postoperative care facilities was associated with seven to 10 more deaths per 100 major complications in LMICs. Cancer stage alone explained little of the early variation in mortality or postoperative complications. INTERPRETATION: Higher levels of mortality after cancer surgery in LMICs was not fully explained by later presentation of disease. The capacity to rescue patients from surgical complications is a tangible opportunity for meaningful intervention. Early death after cancer surgery might be reduced by policies focusing on strengthening perioperative care systems to detect and intervene in common complications.

Current pandemic is also characterized by surge in hospitalizations which has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems. Therefore, it is imperative to assess supply side preparedness in tandem with demand projections for comprehensive outlook. OBJECTIVE: Hence, we attempted this study to forecast the demand for hospital resources for one year period and correspondingly assessed capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in demand due to COVID-19. METHODS: We employed age- structured deterministic SEIR model and modified it to allow for testing and isolation capacity to forecast the demand under varying scenarios. Projections for documented cases were made for varying degree of mitigation strategies of a) No-lockdown b) Moderate-lockdown c) Full-lockdown. Correspondingly, data on a) General beds b) ICU beds and c) Ventilators was collated from various government records. Further, we computed the daily turnover of each of these resources which was then adjusted for proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at maximum number of COVID-19 cases manageable by health care system of India. FINDINGS: Our results revealed pervasive deficits in the capacity of public health system to absorb surge in demand during peak of epidemic. Also, continuing strict lockdown measures was found to be ineffective in suppressing total infections significantly, rather would only push the peak by a month. However, augmented testing of 500,000 tests per day during peak (mid-July) under moderate lockdown scenario would lead to more reported cases (5,500,000-6,000,000), leading to surge in demand for hospital resources. A minimum allocation of 10% public resources and 30% private resources would be required to commensurate with demand under that scenario. However, if the testing capacity is limited by 200,000 tests per day under same scenario, documented cases would plummet by half.","output":"Projecting Demand-Supply Gap of Hospital Capacity in India in the face of COVID-19 pandemic using Age-Structured Deterministic SEIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Despite being a participating Solutions for Patient Safety (SPS) childrens hospital and having attempted implementation of the SPS hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) prevention bundle, our hospital remained at a HAPI rate that was 3 times the mean for SPS participating childrens hospitals. This performance led to the launch of an enterprise-wide HAPI reduction initiative in our organization. The purpose of this article is to describe the improvement initiative, the key drivers, and the resulting decrease in the SPS-reportable HAPI rate. METHODS: We designed a hospital-wide HAPI reduction initiative with actions grouped into 3 key driver areas: standardization, data transparency, and accountability. We paused all individual hospital unit-based HAPI reduction initiatives. We calculated the rate of SPS-reportable HAPIs per 1,000 patient days during both the pre- and postimplementation phases and compared mean rates using a 2-sided t test assuming unequal variances. RESULTS: The mean SPS-reportable HAPI rate for the preimplementation phase was 0.3489, and the postimplementation phase was 0.0609. The difference in rates was statistically significant (P < 0.00032). This result equates to an 82.5% reduction in HAPI rate.

Populations that are vulnerable to this outbreak and its physical and mental health effects include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Telehealth is a potential tool to deliver health care and decrease exposure risk. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to explore the impact of confinement on the health and well-being of community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, to provide television-based and telephone-based health and social support, and to study the effects of a television-based assistive integrated technology, TV-AssistDem (TeleVision-based ASSistive Integrated Service to supporT European adults living with mild DEMentia or mild cognitive impairment). METHODS: A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants in the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from March 25 to April 6, 2020. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 60/93 (65%) were women. The mean age was 73.34 (SD 6.07), and 69/93 (74%) lived accompanied. Lockdown measures forced 17/93 respondents (18%) to change their living arrangements. Health status was found to be optimal in 89/93 respondents (96%), with no COVID-19 symptoms. Grocery and pharmacy outings were performed by family members of 68/93 participants (73%); 57 (61%) reported overall well-being, and 65 (70%) maintained their sleep quality. However, participants living alone reported greater negative feelings and more sleeping problems. Regarding leisure activities, 53/93 respondents (57%) took walks, 32 (35%) played memory games, 55 (60%) watched television, and 91 (98%) telephoned relatives. 58/93 (64%) respondents reported accessing moderate or too much COVID-19 information, 89 (97%) received it from television, and 56 (62%) stated that their understanding of the information was extreme. 39/93 (39%) respondents had contacted health and social services, while 29 (31%) requested information regarding these services during the telephone call. There were no significant differences in health and well-being between the intervention and control groups. Respondents with TV-AssistDem performed more memory exercises (24/93, 52% vs 8/93, 17.4%; P<.001) than control respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that during COVID-19 confinement, the physical and mental health and well-being was optimal for the majority of our vulnerable population. However, those living alone reported greater negative psychological effects and sleeping problems. Measures adopted to address the negative experiences of confinement included keeping informed about the situation, accessing health and social services, having a support network that prevents risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guarantees food and medical supplies, a daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring social connectedness using technology. Television sets were preferred technological devices to access COVID-19 information, watch television as a recreational activity, and perform memory exercises as an intellectual activity. Television-based telehealth support using TV-AssistDem demonstrated potential for cognitive stimulation.

Given the demand for using such platforms to deliver patient care and the need for virtual GOC communication due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, medical education needs to swiftly adjust to these skills of the future. Thus, a needs assessment was conducted to determine 4th-year undergraduate medical learner (UML) training and self-confidence in telemedicine and GOC communication. Aim Statement Evaluate the need for a formal telemedicine GOC curriculum for undergraduate medical learners. Methods 4th-year UMLs from a single institution were surveyed to determine current exposure to telemedicine and GOC communication training. Responses were gathered from 18 to 22 March 2021 and analyzed. Results Of the 165 learners surveyed, 26 (15.7%) identified as having prior informal or on-the-job telemedicine training. 69 (41.8%) reported some prior GOC training. Learners self-evaluated their ability to conduct telemedicine GOC patient encounters as follows: 3 (1.8%) extremely competent, 31 (18.8%) somewhat competent, 69 (41.8%) neither competent nor incompetent, 49 (29.7%) somewhat incompetent, and 13 (7.9%) extremely incompetent. Because most learners do not identify as at least competent in performing telemedicine GOC conversations and the majority have had no formal training, a curriculum was developed using a P-T-SPIKEES framework to provide specific telemedicine-focused GOC communication skills to facilitate these virtual conversations.

Many of the HCWs had less than 2 years of work experience (42%). Additionally, 82% of the respondents had <1 week of cholera emergency response training, and 50% of the HCWs managed >20 suspected cases of cholera per day. Although 78% of HCWs reported the practice of universal safety precautions, 32% (n = 18) knew HCWs who developed symptoms of cholera during the epidemic, most of which was believed to be hospital acquired (78%). We also found that 77% (n = 43) of HCWs had no access to the required emergency response supplies. CONCLUSION: Inadequate training, a lack of qualified HCWs and a limited supply of emergency response kits were reported. Therefore, the government and stakeholders should address the gaps noted to adequately control and prevent future epidemics.","output":"An assessment of the emergency response among health workers involved in the 2010 cholera outbreak in northern Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2, like its? cousin SARS-CoV, uses a variety of entry receptors including angiotensin converting enzyme?2 (ACE2), L-SIGN (CD209L), and DC-SIGN and others. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host cell proteins is the first and decisive step in establishing a COVID-19 infection. This fact inspired us to create ViruClear, a molecularly designed biomimetic proteolipid bilayer decoy receptor nanosponge (100 nm nanospheres) containing an optimal combination of receptors and factors used by SARS-CoV-2 to bind host cells. Antiviral medicine (and most vaccines) often target a single viral target and may be rendered ineffective as the virus accumulates mutations and escapes treatments. By contrast, ViruClear nanosponges display as ?decoys? the same set of receptors and factors that the SARS-CoV-2 depend on for cellular entry and infection. As such, the ViruClear platform is agnostic to viral mutations and potentially viral variant species, as long as the entry receptors overlap with those of SARS-CoV-2. Our preliminary data validate that the ViruClear decoy can multivalently trap viral particles and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infections in animal and human cells. ViruClear is a novel ?game changing? decoy receptor nanosponge optimized for multivalent capture of SARS-CoV-2 in the body (IV injection) or as a preventive measure in nebulized formats (e.g., molecular PPE).

The aim of the research was to study the milk productivity and composition of milk of cows, to analyze the level of feeding and the content of basic nutrients in the diet of the farm. The farm breeds purebred Holstein cattle with a high genetic potential for productivity. The milking herd was formed in 2009 on the basis of 600 heads of Holstein-Friesian heifers imported from Hungary, as well as 65 heads of Holsteinized heifers of Ukrainian selection from Ukraine in 2015. Today the livestock numbers about 1,500 head of cattle, of which there are about 900 breeders. On the territory of the farm there are: 3 cowsheds for keeping cows, an insemination room, a milking parlor with a parallel installation of the Delaval company, in which 48 cows are milked for one milking, the ABK, where the manager's office, livestock technician, accounting is located, and a mini-hotel with dining room and lounges. Dairy bases are equipped with auto-drinkers, ventilation, plumbing, electric lighting, manure removal mechanisms, and a milking installation. The object of the research was Holstein cows in the amount of 483 heads of Aina Dairy Farm LLP. The studies were carried out according to generally accepted zootechnical methods using modern equipment for conducting analyzes and interstate and state standards. The research results showed that the milk productivity of cows averaged 19.5 kg per day, the fat content 4.3%, the protein 3.9%, the number of somatic cells 230.5 thousand units / ml, urea 45.3 mg / 100 ml respectively. Analyzing the level of urea in milk can suggest a high crude protein content in the diet.

Reasons for not using telemedicine include the perceived difficulty with obtaining a reliable history and an inability to perform a physical examination. However, FTF consultation can cause distress and inconvenience to the child and family. In 2018, the authors' department piloted a clinical nurse specialist-led telephone consultation (TC) for follow-up appointments. This was extended to the routine neurosurgery clinics in 2020. In this study, the authors evaluate 1) the effectiveness of TC, 2) families' experience with TC compared with traditional FTF appointments, and 3) the factors associated with their preferences. METHODS: In this prospective study using a survey methodology, TCs carried out by 2 consultant neurosurgeons and 1 nurse specialist over 8 weeks were evaluated. Based on clinical background, each patient was assigned to a TC or FTF appointment. Clinical and surgical details and home postal code were recorded. At the end of each TC, the clinician recorded whether the child required an FTF appointment within 3 months. In addition, patients/families answered 1) how the current TC compared with FTF consultation, and 2) their preference of TC or FTF for the next consultation. RESULTS: A total of 114 TCs were included. No child required an FTF appointment within 3 months. Overall, compared with an FTF appointment, the TC was the \\"same/better/much better\\" for 101 families (89%), and \\"worse/much worse\\" for 13 (11%). Two-thirds of families preferred the next appointment to be a TC. Families attending a TC for new appointments preferred the next appointment to be FTF compared with those attending a follow-up TC (6/8 [75%] vs 31/106 [29%], p = 0.006). A high rating of the current TC was associated with a preference for a TC as the next appointment (p < 0.0001). Families preferring TC over FTF lived farther from the hospital (mean 38 vs 27 km) (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: From the clinicians' perspective, TC is adequate in appropriately selected patients as either the primary mode of consultation or as a triage system. From a service users' perspective, the majority of families felt that the appointment was the same/better than traditional FTF appointments. The findings suggested that 1) new patients should be offered FTF appointments; 2) follow-up TCs should be offered to families when possible; and 3) clinicians should develop their skills in conducting TCs. The authors' results have led to a modification of our algorithm in delivering traditional outpatient service and telemedicine with telephone.","output":"Clinical effectiveness of and family experience with telephone consultation in a regional pediatric neurosurgery center in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The pandemia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been a diagnostic challenge in which chest X-rays have had a key role. This study aimed to determine whether the Radiological Scale for Evaluating Hospital Admission (RSEHA) applied to chest X-rays of patients with COVID-19 when they present at the emergency department is related with the severity of COVID-19 in terms of the need for admission to the hospital, the need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and/or mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 292 patients with COVID-19 who presented at the emergency department between March 16, 2020 and April 30, 2020. To standardize the radiologic patterns, we used the RSEHA, categorizing the radiologic pattern as mild, moderate, or severe. We analyzed the relationship between radiologic severity according to the RSEHA with the need for admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, and mortality. RESULTS: Hospital admission was necessary in 91.4% of the patients. The RSEHA was significantly associated with the need for hospital admission (p=0.03) and with the need for ICU admission (p<0.001). A total of 51 (17.5%) patients died; of these, 57% had the severe pattern on the RSEHA. When we analyzed mortality by grouping patients according to their results on the RSEHA and their age range, the percentage of patients who died increased after age 70 years in patients classified as moderate or severe on the RSEHA. CONCLUSIONS: Chest X-rays in patients with COVID-19 obtained in the emergency department are useful for determining the prognosis in terms of admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, and mortality; radiologic patterns categorized as severe on the RSEHA are associated with greater mortality and admission to the ICU.","output":"Usefulness of chest X-rays for evaluating prognosis in patients with COVID-19./ Utilidad de la radiografa de trax para evaluar el pronstico de pacientes con COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats host a number of viruses that cause severe disease in humans without experiencing overt symptoms of disease themselves. While the mechanisms underlying this ability to avoid sickness are not known, deep sequencing studies of bat genomes have uncovered genetic adaptations that may have functional importance in the antiviral response of these animals. Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are the natural reservoir hosts of Marburg virus (MARV). In contrast to humans, these bats do not become sick when infected with MARV. A striking difference to the human genome is that Egyptian rousettes have an expanded repertoire of IFNW genes. To probe the biological implications of this expansion, we synthesized IFN-4 and IFN-9 proteins and tested their antiviral activity in Egyptian rousette cells. Both IFN-4 and IFN-9 showed antiviral activity against RNA viruses, including MARV, with IFN-9 being more efficient than IFN-4. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the transcriptional response induced by each protein. Although the sets of genes induced by the two IFNs were largely overlapping, IFN-9 induced a more rapid and intense response than did IFN-4. About 13% of genes induced by IFN- treatment are not found in the Interferome or other ISG databases, indicating that they may be uniquely IFN-responsive in this bat.","output":"Egyptian Rousette IFN- Subtypes Elicit Distinct Antiviral Effects and Transcriptional Responses in Conspecific Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Longer stent retrievers have recently become available and have theoretical advantages over their shorter counterparts. We aim to evaluate whether stent retriever length impacts reperfusion rates in stroke thrombectomy. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected thrombectomy database in which equal diameter (4 mm) stent retrievers were used as the first-line strategy for intracranial internal carotid or middle cerebral artery M1 or M2 occlusions along with a balloon guide catheter from June 2011 to March 2017. The population was dichotomized into long (Trevo 430 mm/Solitaire 440 mm) or short (Trevo 420 mm/Solitaire 420 mm) retrievers. The primary outcome was first-pass modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2b/3 reperfusion. RESULTS Of 1126 thrombectomies performed within the study period, 420 were included. Age, gender, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, ASPECTS, IV tissue plasminogen activator use, stroke etiology, occlusion site, time from last-known-normal to puncture, distribution of Trevo and Solitaire, and the use of newer generation local thromboaspiration devices were comparable between the long and short retrievers. The short retriever group had more frequent hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. First-pass mTICI 2b/3 reperfusion was more common in the long retriever group (62% vs 50%; P=0.01). Parenchymal hematomas type 2, subarachnoid hemorrhage, 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, and mortality were comparable. Multivariable analysis indicated that long retriever (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.6; P=0.001), radiopaque device (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4; P=0.003), and adjuvant local aspiration (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.3; P=0.003) were independently associated with first-pass reperfusion.

Such perceptions are likely to influence how Christian individuals conceptualise and experience their mental health and enact help-seeking behaviours. This study explores perceptions of depression and mental health help-seeking in evangelical Christianity by using a novel qualitative story completion task. A convenience sample of 110 Christian participants from the United Kingdom completed a third-person, fictional story stem featuring a male with depression who entered his local church. A contextualist-informed thematic analysis illustrated how the disclosure of depression was represented as eliciting negative social reactions, potentially rendering individuals with depression as socially dislocated. Stories suggested that, increasingly, evangelical Christians may perceive a spiritualisation of mental illness, which negates reference to psychological, social, and biomedical representations, as unhelpful. Findings reveal the risks of a solely spiritual aetiology of depression and highlight how existing mental ill-health can be exacerbated if fundamentalist beliefs and approaches to therapeutic care are prioritised over holistic models of care.

Fortunately, recent transformative omics approaches have enabled us to examine vascular aging mechanisms at unprecedented levels and precision, which make our understanding of slowing down or reversing vascular aging become possible. Epigenetic viz. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA-based mechanisms, is a hallmark of vascular aging, its deregulation leads to aberrant transcription changes in tissues. Epigenetics mechanisms by mediating covalent modifications to DNA and histone proteins, consequently, influence the sensitivity and activities of signaling pathways in cells and tissues.

This efficacy trial aims to test whether this SMS intervention is an effective method for increasing participation in the NBCSP. Furthermore, a process evaluation will explore the barriers and facilitators to sending the SMS from general practice. METHODS: We will recruit 20 general practices in the western region of Victoria, Australia to participate in a cluster randomised controlled trial. General practices will be randomly allocated with a 1:1 ratio to either a control or intervention group. Established general practice software will be used to identify patients aged 50 to 60 years old who are due to receive a NBCSP kit in the next month. The SMS intervention includes GP endorsement and links to narrative messages about the benefits of and instructions on how to complete the NBCSP kit. It will be sent from intervention general practices to eligible patients prior to receiving the NBCSP kit. We require 1400 eligible patients to provide 80% power with a two-sided 5% significance level to detect a 10% increase in CRC screening participation in the intervention group compared to the control group. Our primary outcome is the difference in the proportion of eligible patients who completed a faecal occult blood test (FOBT) between the intervention and control group for up to 12 months after the SMS was sent, as recorded in their electronic medical record (EMR).

Additionally, such vaccines can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner. In this study, we combine computational prediction of T cell epitopes, recently published B cell epitope mapping studies, and epitope accessibility to select candidate peptide vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We begin with an exploration of the space of possible T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 with interrogation of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, overlap between predicted ligands, protein source, as well as concurrent human/murine coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, viral source protein abundance, sequence conservation, coverage of high frequency HLA alleles and co-localization of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell epitopes. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering to select regions with surface accessibility, high sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified.

There were 118 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the vaccinated group and 202 in the unvaccinated group. Among infected women, 88 of 105 (83.8%) were symptomatic in the vaccinated group vs 149 of 179 (83.2%) in the unvaccinated group (P  .99). During 28 to 70 days of follow-up, there were 10 infections in the vaccinated group and 46 in the unvaccinated group. The hazards of infection were 0.33% vs 1.64% in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, respectively, representing an absolute difference of 1.31% (95% CI, 0.89%-1.74%), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11-0.43). Vaccine-related adverse events were reported by 68 patients; none was severe. The most commonly reported symptoms were headache (n = 10, 0.1%), general weakness (n = 8, 0.1%), nonspecified pain (n = 6, <0.1%), and stomachache (n = 5, <0.1%).

Besides, a total of 148 in-service nursing personnel were selected as the research objects, and 148 questionnaires were recycled effectively. The collected data were analyzed by the improved RFC algorithm. In addition, the research investigated the impacts of demographic factors on nursing personnel's mental health by the one-way variance method. The results demonstrated that the accuracy of the improved algorithm in training samples and test samples reached 83.3% and 81.6%, respectively, both of which were obviously higher than those of support vector machine (SVM) (80.1% and 79.3%, respectively) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) (78.23% and 77.9%, respectively), and the differences showed statistical meanings (P < 0.05). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) showed that the depression levels of 9.46% of the included personnel were above moderate. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) demonstrated that the anxiety levels of 3.38% of the included personnel were above moderate. The insomnia severity index (ISI) indicated that the insomnia levels of 3.38% of the included personnel were above moderate. The average score of male personnel (3.65) was obviously lower than that of female personnel (3.71).

OBJECTIVE This study evaluates the cardioprotective effect and molecular mechanism of XBW against MI/RI. MATERIALS AND METHODS A phytochemistry-based network pharmacology analysis was used to uncover the mechanism of XBW against MI/RI. Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was used to identify chemicals. MI/RI-related targets of XBW were predicted using TargetNet database, OMIC database, etc. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats under anterior descending artery ligation model were divided into Sham, MI/RI and XBW (180 mg/kg, intragastric administration). After 30 min ischaemia and 24 h reperfusion, heart tissues were collected for measurement of myocardial infarct size. After oxygen glucose deprivation for 6 h, H9c2 cells were treated with XBW (60, 240 and 720 g/mL) and diazoxide (100 M) for 18 h of reperfusion. RESULTS Thirty-seven chemicals were identified in XBW; 50 MI/RI-related targets of XBW were predicted using indicated databases. XBW significantly reduced infarct size and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) level after MI/RI; XBW protected H9c2 cells against OGD/R injury. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses by String database showed that the cardioprotective effect of XBW was associated with autophagy and apoptosis signalling pathways. Experimental investigation also verified that XBW suppressed apoptosis, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. CONCLUSIONS XBW showed therapeutic effects against MI/RI mainly via attenuating apoptosis though suppressing excessive autophagy and ER stress.","output":"Integrated chemical profiling, network pharmacology and pharmacological evaluation to explore the potential mechanism of Xinbao pill against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Uganda, the numbers of new coronavirus disease cases have continued to increase slowly since the first case was confirmed.

This publication can be used for advocacy, emphasizing the importance and urgency of reducing this heavy and rapidly growing burden. Kidney diseases contribute to significant physical limitations, loss of quality of life, emotional and cognitive disorders, social isolation and premature death. CKD affects close to 100 million Europeans, with 300 million being at risk, and is projected to become the fifth cause of worldwide death by 2040. Kidney disease also imposes financial burdens, given the costs of accessing healthcare and inability to work. The extrapolated annual cost of all CKD is at least as high as that for cancer or diabetes. In addition, dialysis treatment of kidney diseases imposes environmental burdens by necessitating high energy and water consumption and producing plastic waste. Acute kidney injury is associated with further increases in global morbidity, mortality and economic burden. Yet investment in research for treatment of kidney disease lags behind that of other diseases. This publication is a call for European investment in research for kidney health. The innovations generated should mirror the successful European Union actions against cancer over the last 30 years.

Although the genomes of a few of these viruses have been studied in-depth, the composition and processing of the polyproteins produced from their main ORFs have not. The Marafivirus polyprotein consists of essential proteins that form the viral replicase, as well as structural proteins for virus assembly. It has been proposed that Marafiviruses code for cysteine proteases within their polyproteins, which act as endopeptidases to autocatalytically cleave the polyprotein into functional domains. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that Marafivirus endopeptidases may have deubiquitinating activity, which has been shown to enhance viral replication by downregulating viral protein degradation by the ubiquitin (Ub) proteasomal pathway as well as tampering with cell signaling associated with innate antiviral responses in other positive-sense ssRNA viruses. Here, we provide the first evidence of cysteine proteases from six different Marafiviruses that harbor deubiquitinating activity and reveal intragenus differences toward Ub linkage types. We also examine the structural basis of the endopeptidase/deubiquitinase from the Marafivirus type member, maize rayado fino virus. Structures of the enzyme alone and bound to Ub reveal marked structural rearrangements that occur upon binding of Ub and provide insights into substrate specificity and differences that set it apart from other viral cysteine proteases.","output":"The endopeptidase of the maize-affecting Marafivirus type member maize rayado fino virus doubles as a deubiquitinase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing and ventilation were emphasized broadly to control the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 in confined spaces. Rationales behind these two strategies, however, were debated, especially regarding quantitative recommendations. The answers to what is the safe distance and what is sufficient ventilation are crucial to the upcoming reopening of businesses and schools, but rely on many medical, biological, and engineering factors. This study introduced two new indices into the popular while perfect-mixing-based Wells-Riley model for predicting airborne virus related infection probability C the underlying reasons for keeping adequate social distance and space ventilation. The distance index P(d) can be obtained by theoretical analysis on droplet distribution and transmission from human respiration activities, and the ventilation index E(z) represents the system-dependent air distribution efficiency in a space. The study indicated that 1.6-3.0 m (5.2-9.8 ft) is the safe social distance when considering aerosol transmission of exhaled large droplets from talking, while the distance can be up to 8.2 m (26 ft) if taking into account of all droplets under calm air environment. Because of unknown dose response to COVID-19, the model used one actual pandemic case to calibrate the infectious dose (quantum of infection), which was then verified by a number of other existing cases with short exposure time (hours). Projections using the validated model for a variety of scenarios including transportation vehicles and building spaces illustrated that (1) increasing social distance (e.g., halving occupancy density) can significantly reduce the infection rate (20-40%) during the first 30 minutes even under current ventilation practices; (2) minimum ventilation or fresh air requirement should vary with distancing condition, exposure time, and effectiveness of air distribution systems.","output":"The Efficacy of Social Distance and Ventilation Effectiveness in Preventing COVID-19 Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccines emerging from different platforms differ in efficacy, duration of protection, and side effects.

It is therefore important to evaluate the surgical advantages of this technique in this patient group. METHODS Between August 2010 and July 2015, 165 patients underwent RPGs at our hospital, performed by a single surgeon. Of these patients, 88 underwent reduced-port laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (RPLDG) and 77 underwent reduced-port laparoscopic total gastrectomy (RPLTG). In addition to short-term surgical outcomes after RPG, survival times and the surgical learning curve were also evaluated. RESULTS Blood losses during lymph node dissection in the RPLDG and RPLTG groups were not significantly different (p = 0.160). Conversion to open surgery was necessary in only two patients. Postoperative morbidities were observed in 14.8 % of the RPLDG group and 14.3 % of the RPLTG group, but there were no deaths. Most patients expressed high cosmetic satisfaction in both groups. In the RPLDG group, operation time during reconstruction decreased over the first 50 cases and then plateaued, as the surgeon's experience of the technique increased. In contrast, in the RPLTG group, operation times dropped with surgical experience for both lymph node dissection, plateauing after 40 cases, and for reconstruction, plateauing after 30 cases. Only three patients died of gastric cancer in the follow-up period and three patients died of other diseases. Five-year overall survival and 5-year disease-specific survival were 95.6 and 98.0 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that reduced-port gastrectomy (RPG) could be an acceptable and satisfactory procedure for treating gastric cancer for an experienced laparoscopic gastric surgeon who has sufficient previous experience of conventional laparoscopic gastrectomies.","output":"Surgical advantages of reduced-port laparoscopic gastrectomy in gastric cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facial landmark detection is a widely researched field of deep learning as this has a wide range of applications in many fields.

In the specialty of urology, patients present in daily practice with viral infections that are associated with numerous diseases. METHODOLOGY: The aim of this review is to describe viral infections relevant for urology, and in particular to emphasize vaccination prevention. A selective literature search was carried out on the subjects of COVID and urology, urogenital viral infections, viral urological infections in transplant medicine, and vaccination prevention of viral diseases. RESULTS: Coronaviruses have already caused two local epidemics: SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemic. The fact that the SARS-CoV?2 (SARS coronavirus 2) disease is contagious even without symptoms has essentially led to the rapid spread and global pandemic. A large number of viruses, which can also induce viremia, have been detected in the ejaculate and are thus associated with a possible urogenital infection. These include the mumps virus, Coxsackie viruses or enteroviruses, among others. It has also been shown that a Zika virus infection can also be sexually transmitted via the sperm as a carrier. Viruses therefore also play an important role in reproduction. When performing kidney transplants, urologists are often confronted with viral infections. The most effective weapon against viruses is prevention by vaccination. CONCLUSION: In terms of ethiopathogenesis, the genitourinary tract is most often affected by viruses, in the context of viremia or through reactivation due to immunosuppression. Immunomodulation and vaccination prophylaxis play a leading role in therapy.","output":"Virusinfektionen in der Urologie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Recent reports from communities severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic found lower rates of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Whether the pandemic has affected OHCA outcomes more broadly is unknown. Objective To assess the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and OHCA outcomes, including in areas with low and moderate COVID-19 disease burden. Design, Setting, and Participants This study used a large US registry of OHCAs to compare outcomes during the pandemic period of March 16 through April 30, 2020, with those from March 16 through April 30, 2019. Cases were geocoded to US counties, and the COVID-19 mortality rate in each county was categorized as very low (0-25 per million residents), low (26-100 per million residents), moderate (101-250 per million residents), high (251-500 per million residents), or very high (>500 per million residents). As additional controls, the study compared OHCA outcomes during the prepandemic period (January through February) and peripandemic period (March 1 through 15). Exposure The COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures Sustained ROSC (20 minutes), survival to discharge, and OHCA incidence. Results A total of 19 303 OHCAs occurred from March 16 through April 30 in both years, with 9863 cases in 2020 (mean [SD] age, 62.6 [19.3] years; 6040 men [61.3%]) and 9440 in 2019 (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [19.2] years; 5922 men [62.7%]). During the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC were lower than in 2019 (23.0% vs 29.8%; adjusted rate ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.78-0.87]; P < .001). Sustained ROSC rates were lower by between 21% (286 of 1429 [20.0%] in 2020 vs 305 of 1130 [27.0%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.97]) and 33% (149 of 863 [17.3%] in 2020 vs 192 of 667 [28.8%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.56-0.80]) in communities with high or very high COVID-19 mortality, respectively; however, rates of sustained ROSC were also lower by 11% (583 of 2317 [25.2%] in 2020 vs 740 of 2549 [29.0%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.81-0.98]) to 15% (889 of 3495 [25.4%] in 2020 vs 1109 of 3532 [31.4%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.93]) in communities with very low and low COVID-19 mortality. Among emergency medical services agencies with complete data on hospital survival (7085 total patients), survival to discharge was lower during the pandemic compared with 2019 (6.6% vs 9.8%; adjusted RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-1.00]; P = .048), primarily in communities with moderate to very high COVID-19 mortality (interaction P = .049). Incidence of OHCA was higher than in 2019, but the increase was largely observed in communities with high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 38.6 [95% CI, 37.1-40.1] per million residents) and very high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 28.7 [95% CI, 26.7-30.6] per million residents). In contrast, there was no difference in rates of sustained ROSC or survival to discharge during the prepandemic and peripandemic periods in 2020 vs 2019. Conclusions and Relevance Early during the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC for OHCA were lower throughout the US, even in communities with low COVID-19 mortality rates.

However, the benefit and cost-effectiveness vary in each country or community because they have different standard practices and health care systems. In Japan, rapid antigen tests (RATs) have been frequently used for pediatric respiratory infections. We investigated the impact and cost-effectiveness of a multiplex PCR (mPCR) respiratory panel for pediatric respiratory infections in a Japanese community hospital. METHODS: We replaced RATs with an mPCR respiratory panel (FilmArray?) for admitted pediatric respiratory infections on March 26, 2018. We compared the days of antimicrobial therapy (DOT) and length of stay (LOS) during the mPCR period (March 2018 to April 2019) with those of the RAT period (March 2012 to March 2018). RESULTS: During the RAT and mPCR periods, 1132 and 149 patients were analyzed. The DOT/case was 12.82 vs 8.56 (p < 0.001), and the LOS was 8.18 vs 6.83 days (p = 0.032) in the RAT and mPCR groups, respectively. The total costs during admissions were ?258,824 ($2331.7) and ?243,841 ($2196.8)/case, respectively. Pathogen detection rates were 30.2% vs 87.2% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional RATs, the mPCR test contributed to a reduction in the DOT and LOS in a Japanese community hospital for admission-requiring pediatric respiratory infections.

This study aimed to analyse the extent of divergence between genomes of Indian isolates (n=2525 as compared to reference Wuhan-1 strain and isolates from countries showing higher fatality rates including France, Italy, Belgium, and the USA. The study also analyses the impact of key mutations on interactions with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Using 1,44,605 spike protein sequences, global prevalence of mutations in spike protein was observed. The study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India share consensus with global trends with respect to D614G as most prevalent mutational event (81.66% among 2525 Indian isolates). Indian isolates did not reported prevalence of N439K mutation in receptor binding motif (RBM) as compared to global isolates (0.54%). Computational docking and molecular dynamics simulation analysis of N439K mutation with respect to ACE 2 binding and reactivity with RBM targeted antibodies viz., B38, BD23, CB6, P2B-F26 and EY6A suggests that variant have relatively higher affinity with ACE 2 receptor which may support higher infectivity.

The problem comes from the irregular ordering of cans from different customers;not only national companies, but also from companies abroad. This causes fluctuations in production and consequently an irregular transport regime. That is why the beverage can producer demanded a forecasting system that would help to create an annual production plan. The aim is to analyze the ordering process for the last two years and on that basis to create a forecast system of the possible ordering process for the following year. This is necessary for the introduction of regularity of production, because the frequent transitions of the line to another assortment range or other surface printing requires long downtimes due to the technological setting, thus creating large losses due to inactivity of the production line. As drinking habits of final customers reflect the sale of cans, it was expected that sale data would have a seasonable character;this was proved after a brief analysis of the former data. After that, the appropriate forecasting methods were chosen. The methodology was created to combine multiple forecast results into one to increase the forecast objectivity. Forecasting is performed at three different levels: forecasting of assortment, forecasting of region sale and total forecasting of all orders. In spite of the change in market behavior in 2020, due to the pandemic situation in the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis, the sale of beverage cans is expected to stabilize and return to pre-crisis level as early as 2021. Then the forecasting system will fully meet the companys requirements.","output":"Creation of Annual Order Forecast for the Production of Beverage CansThe Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, kinetics of the reaction between 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methylpyridium-4-yl)porphyrin and Ni2+ species were investigated in aqueous solution at 25 1 oC in I = 0.10 M (NaNO3). Speciation of Ni2+ was carried out in I = 0.10 M (NaNO3) in order to provide the distribution of the Ni2+ species with different solution pH. The experimental data have been compared with the speciation diagram constructed from the values of hydrolysis constants of Ni2+ ion. Speciation data showed that the hexaaquanickel(II), [Ni(H2O)6]2+, ions take place in hydrolysis reactions through formation of [Ni(OH2)6-n(OH)n]2-n species with solution pH. Based on the speciation of Ni2+ and pH dependent rate constants, rate expression can be written as: d[Ni(TMPyP)4+]/dt = (k1[Ni2+(aq)] + k2[Ni(OH)+(aq)] + k3[Ni(OH)2o(aq)] + k4[Ni(OH)3-(aq)])[H2TMPyP4+], where k1, k2, k3 and k4 were found to be k1 = (0.62 0.22) 10-2;k2 = (3.60 0.40) 10-2;k3 = (2.09 0.52) 10-2, k4 = (0.53 0.04) 10-2 M-1s-1 at 25 1 C, respectively. Kinetic results showed that monohydroxo, [Ni(H2O)5(OH)]+, is the most reactive among the [Ni(OH2)6-n(OH)n]2-n species. The enhanced reactivity has been ascribed to the formation of hydrogen bonding between oxygen atom of hydroxyl group of the [Ni(H2O)5(OH)]+ species and the pyrrolic hydrogen atom of the [H2TMPyP]4+. The rate of formation of [Ni(II)TMPyP]4+ complex was to be 3.99 10-2 M-1s-1 in I = 0.10 M, NaNO3 (25 1 oC). Ionic strength effect on the reaction rate is suggested that the net charge of the tetracationic porphyrin is to be +3.6 on the basis of Br?nsted-Bjerrum equation. The UV-Vis and fluorescence data revealed that [Ni(II)TMPyP]4+ and H2(TMPyP)4+ interact with DNA, and UV-Vis results suggest that Ni(II)-porphyrin and free base porphyrin interact with DNA via outside binding with self-stacking and intercalation, respectively. Mechanism of kinetics of formation of the [Ni(II)TMPyP]4+ complex in aqueous medium is discussed. An investigation of application of the [Ni(II)TMPyP]4+ complex along with other metalloporphyrins such as Zn2+-, Ru2+-, Pt2+-, [Au(III)TMPyP]5+ as anti-COVID-19 agents is now in progress under international collaboration.","output":"Formation of Nickel(II)Porphyrin and Its Interaction with DNA in Aqueous Medium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This review formulates the rationale for using enhanced recovery protocols (ERPs) to standardize and optimize perioperative care during this high-risk time to minimize poor outcomes owing to provider, patient, and system vulnerabilities.

There are approximately 5.6 cases of meningioma per 100,000 pregnant women. Foramen magnum meningioma is rare, and the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are complex in pregnant women. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of foramen magnum meningioma in a pregnant woman at 32 weeks of gestation, who presented with chronic neck pain and cervical myelopathy. She tested positive for COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were compatible with foramen magnum meningioma, and the pathologic analysis revealed a WHO grade-I meningioma. The patient underwent cesarean section followed by tumor excision due to fetal distress and rapid deterioration. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Management of meningioma during pregnancy requires a multidisciplinary approach. No guidelines for surgical intervention, timing of pregnancy termination, or mode of delivery for pregnant patients with foramen magnum meningioma have been established. While it is best to prolong the pregnancy for as long as possible, a cesarean delivery is preferred to avoid increased intracranial pressure. Operative management of meningioma is warranted if the tumor is growing or symptomatic. This patient died due to the added complication of COVID-19. Although the prognosis of foramen magnum meningioma is usually favorable, COVID-19 comorbidity can increase illness severity.

Although we are fully aware and concerned about carbon monoxide (CO) and its toxicity, exposure to CO from common, though occult sources like MC smoke is often overlooked. Equally, the adverse health effects, especially to the brain, are usually underestimated. OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of exposure to CO from MC smoke inhalation on spatial memory in mice. METHODS Sixteen, adult, male, mice, were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group; each having 8 mice. The experimental group was exposed to the MC smoke (Wavetide, China) that was allowed to burn inside the gas chamber (75 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm) for 15 minutes, daily, for 14 days. Digital CO meter (PCMM05 Pyle) was used to measure the amount of CO and Barnes maze protocol to assess the spatial memory. RESULTS Our results indicate that burning MC for 15 minutes produced up to 312 parts per million (ppm) of CO and raised the blood carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) level by 15.8%. This is higher than the WHO recommended limit (<100 mg/m3 or 87 ppm for 15 min.) of CO exposure and the %COHb level of <2%. Mosquito coil smoke was also associated with impaired spatial memory. However, the dose and duration of exposure did not significantly affect weight gain in the mice.

Senescent cells accumulate in different tissues and organs where they have distinct physiological and pathological functions. Despite this diversity, all senescent cells must be able to survive in a nondividing state while protecting themselves from positive feedback loops linked to the constant activation of the DNA damage response.

We add to this research by examining trends in lifespan inequality, average years of life lost, and the contribution of specific causes of death and ages to race/ethnic life expectancy disparities in the USA from 2010 to 2020.

METHODS: From March to December 2020, HCWs were subjected to molecular and serology testing of SARS-CoV-2. Reinfection was defined as a positive test result during the first wave, either by serology or PCR, followed by a positive PCR during the second wave. Evolution of COVID-19 status of HWCs was assessed by a Sankey diagram. RESULTS: A total of 7765 tests (4579 PCR and 3186 serology) were carried out and 4168 HCWs had at least one test result during the follow-up period with a positivity rate of 15.9%. No case of reinfection during the second wave could be observed among 102 positive HCWs of the first wave, nor among 175 HCWs found positive by PCR during the second wave who were negative during the first wave. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was not observed among HCWs, suggesting a protective immunity against reinfection that lasts at least 8 months post infection.","output":"No SARS-CoV-2 reinfection among staff health-care workers: Prospective hospital-wide screening during the first and second waves in Paris"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atherosclerosis is a pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory disease state, which is the underlying cause of most cardiovascular events, estimated to affect 5.2% of the Australian population.

Mechanical ventilation remains the cornerstone of management for ARDS; however, potentially injurious mechanical forces introduce the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, multiple organ failure, and death. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a salvage therapy aimed at ensuring adequate gas exchange for patients suffering from severe ARDS with profound hypoxemia where conventional mechanical ventilation has failed. ECMO allows for lower tidal volumes and airway pressures, which can reduce the risk of further lung injury, and allow the lungs to rest. However, the collateral effect of ECMO should be considered. Recent studies have reported correlations between mechanical ventilator settings during ECMO and mortality. In many cases, mechanical ventilation settings should be tailored to the individual; however, researchers have yet to establish optimal ventilator settings or determine the degree to which ventilation load can be decreased. This paper presents an overview of previous studies and clinical trials pertaining to the management of mechanical ventilation during ECMO for patients with severe ARDS, with a focus on clinical findings, suggestions, protocols, guidelines, and expert opinions.

Obesity is a risk factor for the development of immune-mediated and some inflammatory-mediated diseases, including atherosclerosis and psoriasis, leading to a dampened immune response to infectious agents, leading to weaker post-infection impacts. Moreover, the obese host creates a special microenvironment for disease pathogenesis, marked by persistent low-grade inflammation.

METHODS: A deliberate system-level approach was used to expand a preexisting airway response service. Through a needs analysis (taking into account both existing resources and anticipated demands), we established priorities and solutions for the airway management challenges encountered during the pandemic. RESULTS: During our COVID-19 surge (March 10, 2020, through May 26, 2020), there were 619 airway consults, and the COVID airway response team (CART) performed 341 intubations. Despite a 4-fold increase in intubations during the surge, there was no increase in cardiac arrests or surgical airways and no documented COVID-19 infections among the CART. CONCLUSIONS: Our system-level approach successfully met the sudden escalation in demand in airway management incurred by the COVID-19 surge.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a prospective single-center study in our institution in Paris. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 SARS were prospectively recruited via our ICU. Patients were evaluated using standardized cognitive tests at baseline and at three months follow-up. Our primary endpoint was the evolution of the following five global tests: MMSE, FAB, oral naming test, Dubois five words test and MADRS. RESULTS: We explored 13 patients at baseline and follow-up. All patients had cognitive impairment at baseline but they all improved at three months, significantly on two of the five global tests after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing: MMSE (median 18 (IQR [15C22]) and 27 (IQR [27C29]) respectively, P = 0.002) and FAB test (median 14 (IQR [14C17]) and 17 (IQR [17,18]) respectively, P = 0.002).

We conducted a local study to assess the real-life experience of patients undergoing ultrahypofractionated schedule to compare feasibility and toxicity to the fast-forward trial during the COVID - 19 pandemic. Methods: A single institution, retrospective, qualitative study. Patients included had early-stage breast cancer and received adjuvant radiotherapy between 23 March 2020 and 31 May 2020, a total of 211 patients. Inclusion was irrespective of any other neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatments. Data were collected retrospectively for treatment dose, boost dose and toxicity. Results: Of the total 211 patients, 85 were treated with 26Gy in 5# and 19 patients received a boost as per the fast-forward protocol. Of these 85 patients, 15.9% did not report any skin toxicity post-treatment. 63.5% of patients reported RTOG Grade 1, 15.9% had RTOG Grade 2, and 1.6% reported RTOG Grade 3 skin toxicity. 3.2% of the patients could not be contacted for follow-up. Of the 19 patients who received a breast boost, 10.53% reported no skin changes. 78.9% reported Grade 1 skin toxicity. Both Grades 2a and 2b skin toxicity were reported by 5.26% each. The patient demographics and tumour characteristics in our study cohort were comparable to those within the fast-forward trial. In terms of post-RT skin toxicity, fewer patients reported any toxicity in the UHB patient cohort versus those in the trial, and the number of Grade 2/3 toxicities reported was also low. A delay in toxicity reporting from 2 weeks for 40Gy/15 to 3 weeks for 26Gy/5 was observed. Conclusion: Our study concluded that offering ultrahypofractionation was convenient for patients;reducing the number of hospital visits during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic appeared safe in terms of acute post-RT-related skin toxicity. The reduced hospital visits limited exposure of patients and staff to the SARS-CoV-2 virus while also ensuring efficient use of Radiotherapy Department resources. Local follow-up protocols have been amended to ensure review at 3 weeks for the 26Gy/5 schedule to acknowledge the delay in acute toxicity development.

We aimed to quantify the contribution of symptoms and other case characteristics in norovirus transmission using the reproduction number (R(Ei)) as an estimate of individual case infectivity and to examine how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. Individual estimates of R(Ei) were calculated using a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the average number of secondary cases generated by each case. The associations between case characteristics and R(Ei) were estimated using a weighted multivariate mixed linear model. Outbreaks began with one to three index case(s) with large estimated R(Ei)s (range: 1.48 to 8.70) relative to subsequent cases. Of the 209 cases, 155 (75%) vomited, 164 (79%) had diarrhea, and 158 (76%) were nursing home residents (vs. staff). Cases who vomited infected 2.12 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.68) times the number of individuals as non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.39 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.87) times the number of individuals as cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.53 (95% CI: 1.15, 2.02) times the number of individuals as staff-cases. Index cases tended to be residents (vs. staff) who vomited and infected considerably more secondary cases compared to non-index cases. Results suggest that individuals, particularly residents, who vomit are more infectious and tend to drive norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home norovirus outbreaks. While diarrhea also plays a role in norovirus transmission, it is to a lesser degree than vomiting in these settings.

Instead, memory B cells that emerge 5 months after vaccination of na?ve individuals express antibodies that are similar to those that dominate the initial response. While individual memory antibodies selected over time by natural infection have greater potency and breadth than antibodies elicited by vaccination, the overall neutralizing potency of plasma is greater following vaccination.

To this end, 36 German Academic Medical Centers started to collaborate on 13 projects, with the largest being the National Pandemic Cohort Network (NAPKON). The NAPKONs goal is creating the most comprehensive Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cohort in Germany. Within NAPKON, adult and pediatric patients are observed in three complementary cohort platforms (Cross-Sectoral, High-Resolution and Population-Based) from the initial infection until up to three years of follow-up. Study procedures comprise comprehensive clinical and imaging diagnostics, quality-of-life assessment, patient-reported outcomes and biosampling. The three cohort platforms build on four infrastructure core units (Interaction, Biosampling, Epidemiology, and Integration) and collaborations with NUM projects. Key components of the data capture, regulatory, and data privacy are based on the German Centre for Cardiovascular Research. By December 01, 2021, 34 university and 34 non-university hospitals have enrolled 4,241 patients with local data quality reviews performed on 2,812 (66%). 47% were female, the median age was 53 (IQR: 38-63)) and 3 pediatric cases were included. 30% of patients were hospitalized, 11% admitted to an intensive care unit, and 4% of patients deceased while enrolled. 7,143 visits with biosampling in 3,595 patients were conducted by November 29, 2021.

Urgent fluoroscopy showed stuck one of the AV leaflets in a closed and opening positions. Echocardiography showed high peak and mean AV gradients. The patient was confirmed with COVID-19 with fever on the day of admission. Cardiac CT with contrast showed stuck right (posterior) disc with a 6  4 mm thrombus surrounded by pannus formation. The patient was started on ultraslow thrombolytic therapy (alteplase 1 mg, every hour for 25 h, followed by 6 h of unfractionated heparin). Repeated fluoroscopy showed normal opening and closure of both discs. Repeated echocardiography showed a significant reduction in the peak and mean AV gradients back to baselines. The patient was discharged after 7 days with INR 3.0 for two consecutive days. The patient was asymptomatic with stable INR in three- and six-month follow-up visits. Transthoracic ultrasound demonstrated normally functioning mechanical AV. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Accurate and timely diagnosis of stuck mechanical AV requires high suspicion and timely diagnostic aids. CONCLUSION: Full recovery can be achieved after one cycle of ultraslow thrombolytic therapy.

We describe characteristics and outcomes of confirmed ARDS in COVID-19 patients managed with invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study in consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS (as defined by the Berlin criteria) affected with with COVID-19 (confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens), admitted to a network of 36 Spanish and Andorran intensive care units (ICUs) between March 12 and June 1, 2020. We examined the clinical features, ventilatory management, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 ARDS patients, and compared some results with other relevant studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: A total of 742 patients were analysed with complete 28-day outcome data: 128 (17.1%) with mild, 331 (44.6%) with moderate, and 283 (38.1%) with severe ARDS. At baseline, defined as the first day on invasive MV, median (IQR) values were: tidal volume 6.9 (6.3C7.8) ml/kg predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure 12 (11C14) cmH(2)O. Values of respiratory system compliance 35 (27C45) ml/cmH(2)O, plateau pressure 25 (22C29) cmH(2)O, and driving pressure 12 (10C16) cmH(2)O were similar cto values from non-COVID-19 ARDS observed in other studies. Recruitment maneuvers, prone position and neuromuscular blocking agents were used in 79%, 76% and 72% of patients, respectively. The risk of 28-day mortality was lower in mild ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.56 (95% CI 0.33C0.93), p = 0.026] and moderate ARDS [hazard ratio (RR) 0.69 (95% CI 0.47C0.97), p = 0.035] when compared to severe ARDS. The 28-day mortality was similar to other observational studies in non-COVID-19 ARDS patients.

The virus infects human using its spike glycoprotein mediated by a crucial area, receptor-binding domain (RBD), to bind to the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Mutations on RBD have been observed in different countries and classified into nine types: A435S, D364Y, G476S, N354D/D364Y, R408I, V341I, V367F, V483A and W436R. Employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we investigated dynamics and structures of the complexes of the prototype and mutant types of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBDs and hACE2. We then probed binding free energies of the prototype and mutant types of RBD with hACE2 protein by using an end-point molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. According to the result of MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations, we found that V367F and N354D/D364Y mutant types showed enhanced binding affinities with hACE2 compared to the prototype. Our computational protocols were validated by the successful prediction of relative binding free energies between prototype and three mutants: N354D/D364Y, V367F and W436R. Thus, this study provides a reliable computational protocol to fast assess the existing and emerging RBD mutations.

The chapter discusses that microorganisms and herbivores rely on plants as a food source. Since both have survived, there must be mechanisms of adaptations toward the defensive chemistry of plants. Many herbivores have evolved strategies to avoid the extremely toxic plants and prefer the less toxic ones. Many herbivores have potent mechanisms to detoxify xenobiotics, which allow the exploitation of at least the less toxic plants. In insects, many specialists evolved that are adapted to the defense chemicals of their host plant, in that they accumulate these compounds and exploit them for their own defense. Alkaloids function as defense molecules against insect predators in the examples studied, and this is further support for the hypothesis that the same compound also serves for chemical defense in the host plant.

Since ICU healthcare workers (HCWs) are exposed to aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), ensuring optimal personal-protective equipment (PPE) preparedness is important. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate PPE-preparedness across intensive care units (ICUs) in six Asia-Pacific countries during the initial phase of COVID-19 pandemic, defined as World Health Organization (WHO) guideline-adherence, training healthcare workers (HCWs), procuring stocks and responding appropriately to suspected cases. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was circulated to ICUs from Australia, New Zealand (NZ), Singapore, Hong Kong (HK), India and Philippines in 633 Level II/III ICUs. FINDINGS: 263 intensivists responded, representing 231 individual ICUs eligible for analysis. Response rates were 68%-100% in all countries except India, where it was 24%. 97% either conformed to or exceeded WHO recommendations for PPE-practice. 59% employed airborne precautions irrespective of aerosol-generation-procedures. There were variations in negative-pressure room use (highest in HK/Singapore), training (best in NZ), and PPE stock-awareness (best in HK/Singapore/NZ). High-flow-nasal-oxygenation and non-invasive ventilation were not options in most HK (66.7%, 83.3% respectively) and Singapore ICUs (50%, 80% respectively), but were considered in other countries to a greater extent. 38% reported not having specialized airway teams. Showering and buddy-systems were underutilized. Clinical waste disposal training was suboptimal (38%). CONCLUSIONS: Many ICUs in the Asian-Pacific reported suboptimal PPE-preparedness in several domains, particularly related to PPE-training, practice and stock-awareness, which requires remediation. Adoption of low-cost approaches such as buddy-systems should be encouraged. The complete avoidance of high-flow nasal oxygenation reported by several intensivists needs reconsideration. Consideration must be given to standardise PPE guidelines to minimize practice variations.

We have developed a new approach to the analysis of hazards and of exposure to the risk of adverse events by linking the patients health record system to the entire infrastructure of the hospital unit. In this study, using the developed model, we focused on infections caused by the Clostridioides difficile bacterium, as they constitute a significant number of nosocomial infections in Poland and worldwide. The study was conducted in a medical facility located in the central part of Poland which provides tertiary care. In the proposed PM model, a risk analysis of hospital acquired infections at the Intensive Care and Anesthesiology Unit combined with the hospitals technical facilities and organizational factors was conducted. The obtained results indicate the most critical events which may have an impact on potential hazards or risks which may result from the patients stay at the specific ward. Our method can be combined with an anti-problem approach, which minimizes the critical level of infection in order to determine the optimal functioning of the entire hospital unit. Research has shown that in most situations the spread dynamics of nosocomial infections can be controlled and their elimination may be attempted. In order to meet these conditions, the persons responsible for the daily operation of the medical facility and its individual wards have to indicate potential events and factors which present a risk to the hospitalized patients. On the basis of a created spreadsheet directions for improvement may be finally established for all potential events, their frequency may be minimized, and information may be obtained on actions which should be undertaken in a crisis situation caused by the occurrence of a given phenomenon.

This problem has the potential to be significantly exacerbated in the light of Artificial Intelligence-aided clinical decision making. We sought to investigate whether bias can be introduced from sources that are considered neutral with respect to ethnicity and race and consequently routinely used in modelling, specifically vital signs. Methods: to perform our analysis, we extracted vital signs from 49,610 admissions from a cohort of adult patients during the first 24 hours after the admission to the Intensive Care Units (ICU), derived from multi-centre eICU-CRD database and single-centre MIMIC-III database, spanning over 208 hospitals and 335 ICUs. Using heart rate, SaO2, respiratory rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure, we develop machine learning models based on Logistic Regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting and investigate their performance in predicting patients' self-reported race. To balance the dataset between the three ethno-races considered in our study, we use a matching cohort based on age, gender, and admission diagnosis. Findings: standard machine learning models, derived solely on six vital signs can be used to predict patients' self-reported race with AUC of 75%.

We also show that oxygen saturation is a highly predictive variable, even when measured through methods other than pulse oximetry, namely arterial blood gas analysis, suggesting that addressing bias in routinely collected clinical variables will be challenging.

By February 2020, most cases were determined as linked with vaping tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), including black market products using vitamin E acetate. This study examined smokers' EVALI awareness, knowledge and perceived impact on their e-cigarette interest approximately 16 months after its peak. DESIGN Between January and February 2021, we surveyed 1018 adult current smokers from a nationally representative US research panel. Participants were asked if they had heard about EVALI prior to COVID-19, knew its main cause, and if EVALI had impacted their interest in future e-cigarette use. RESULTS Approximately 54% of smokers had heard of EVALI. Among those who had heard of EVALI (n=542), 37.3% believed its main cause was e-cigarettes used to vape nicotine, like JUUL. Fewer (16.6%) thought the main cause was products for vaping marijuana/THC, and 20.2% did not know. About 29% had heard vitamin E acetate was associated with EVALI, and 50.9% indicated EVALI made them less interested in using e-cigarettes in the future. EVALI awareness was significantly associated with e-cigarette risk perceptions (ie, that e-cigarettes are as harmful as smoking). CONCLUSIONS Despite the passage of time, considerable lack of knowledge and misperceptions about EVALI remain among those who smoke. Our findings suggest the need for continued efforts to promote better understanding of EVALI and appropriate behavioural and policy responses.","output":"Over 1 year later: smokers' EVALI awareness, knowledge and perceived impact on e-cigarette interest."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: India reported its first COVID-19 case in the state of Kerala and an outbreak initiated subsequently. The Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, this unstructured data limits upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding refinement to generate open and reusable datasets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a frontend web application and a JSON repository, which serves as an API for the frontend. RESULTS: From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for non-specialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak. DISCUSSION: We anticipate that our dataset can form the basis for future studies, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological data from the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala. CONCLUSION: We reported a citizen science initiative on the COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala to collect and deposit data in a structured format, which was utilized for visualizing the outbreak trend and describing demographic characteristics of affected individuals.","output":"A citizen science initiative for open data and visualization of COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We assessed the impacts of COVID-19 on multiple life domains across socio-demographic groups in Netherlands. Methods: After the first COVID-19 wave, we distributed online questionnaires among 13,031 participants of the multi-ethnic HELIUS cohort. Questionnaires contained questions on changes in income status, healthy behaviors, mental health, and access to non-COVID-19 health care. We then calculated differences in adjusted proportions of participants that reported negative changes across multiple life domains by migration background, age, sex, education, and occupation. Results: 4,450 individuals (35%) responded, of which 4,294 were included. Older populations and men seemed to be less vulnerable to negative changes in multiple life domains during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period, while populations with a migration background and lower education/occupation groups seemed to be more vulnerable to negative changes. Conclusion: Not all populations vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality are also more vulnerable to COVID-19 impacts across multiple other life domains. Targeted interventions are needed in socio-demographic groups that are most impacted by COVID-19 in various life domains to prevent a further increase of their already increased risk of chronic diseases after the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Impacts Across Multiple Life Domains of Vulnerable Socio-Demographic Groups Including Migrants: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented burdens on people's physical health and subjective well-being.

White codes decreased from 45.8C35%. Green codes raised from 45.9C52.2%, while yellow and red codes were comparable. As a percentage, accidents increased during COVID-19, being the first cause of PED access (29.7%) (p < 0.0001), while infections and fever category dropped from 49.1C27.7%. (p < 0.001).

We dynamically monitored multiple clinical features of all 75 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 219 pneumonia patients, and 68 matched healthy people in Inner Mongolia. Then, we studied the association between COVID-19 and clinical characteristics, based on which to construct a novel logistic regression model for predicting COVID-19. As a result, among the tested clinical characteristics, WBC, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), ALT, and Cr were significantly different between COVID-19 patients and patients in other groups.

The purpose of this study was to report transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) findings in SARS-CoV-2 patients with correlating troponin and D-dimer levels. METHODS: We identified 66 SARS-CoV-2 patients (mean age 60  15.7 years) admitted within a large, eight-hospital healthcare system over a 6-week period with a TTE performed. TTE readers were blinded to laboratory data with intra-observer and inter-observer analysis assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-six of 1780 SARS-CoV-2 patients were included and represented a high-risk population as 38 (57.6%) were ICU-admitted, 47 (71.2%) had elevated D-dimer, 41 (62.1%) had elevated troponin, and 25 (37.9%) died. Right ventricular (RV) dilation was present in 49 (74.2%) patients. The incidence and average D-dimer elevation was similar between moderate/severe vs. mild/no RV dilation (69.6% vs 67.6%, P = 1.0; 3736  2986 vs 4141  3351 ng/mL, P = .679). Increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness was present in 46 (69.7%) with similar incidence of elevated troponin and average troponin levels compared to normal wall thickness (66.7% vs 52.4%, P = .231; 0.88  1.9 vs 1.36  2.4 ng/mL, P = .772). LV dilation was rare (n = 6, 9.1%), as was newly reduced LV ejection fraction (n = 2, 3.0%). CONCLUSION: TTE in SARS-CoV-2 patients is scarce, technically difficult, and reserved for high-risk patients. RV dilation is common in SARS-CoV-2 but does not correlate with elevated D-dimer levels.

SEM, XRD, and other characterization methods were used to confirm the structure. The adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm, adsorption thermodynamics, and adsorption mechanism of boron by GO/ZIF-67 were studied in this paper. The adsorption capacity of GO/ZIF-67 for boron is up to 66.65 mgg-1 at 25 C, and adsorption process reaches equilibrium in 400 min. Adsorption kinetics indicates that the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and adsorption thermodynamics indicates that the adsorption process is a spontaneous endothermic process controlled by entropy change. The adsorption capacity of boron by GO/ZIF-67 does not decrease significantly after four cycles. The adsorption of boron by GO/ZIF-67 has both chemical and physical adsorption. From Zeta potential and adsorption kinetics, it can be seen that there is physical adsorption during the adsorption process and boron mainly has positive charge on the surface of GO/ZIF-67 and graphene oxide hydroxyl bonding.

Thus, the feasibility of Tai Chi, alongside conventional care, to manage poststroke depression was investigated using a single-group pre-post intervention design. Recruitment and retention, intervention adherence, safety, acceptability, and fidelity were assessed. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed using standardized questionnaires, objective sleep was assessed via a research-grade triaxial accelerometer, and blood samples were taken to measure oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and a neurotrophic growth factor using commercially available kits per manufacturer's protocol. Pre-post intervention changes were assessed using paired t-tests. We enrolled stroke survivors (N = 11, mean age = 69.7  9.3) reporting depression symptoms.

This call comes from the fact that from a health perspective, persons with disabilities have less immunity and are more vulnerable to deceases and infections. Many families of persons with disabilities have also expressed their concerns regarding the safety of their disabled member/s. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the impact of the new COVID-19 on the psychological and social adjustment of families of persons with disabilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE The sample of the study was chosen randomly from the Asir region. The sample consisted of any member of the families of persons with disabilities (parents and siblings). Participants responded to a questionnaire, which was sent electronically via WhatsApp to the families of persons with disabilities. The questionnaire gathered demographic information about the disabled member from the family (age and level of disability). The questionnaire underwent statistical treatment to extract data for analysis. RESULTS The results showed less ability for families of persons with disabilities to adapt psychologically and socially to the spread of COVID-19. The findings revealed the existence of fundamental differences in the levels of psychological and social adaptation among these families due to the level of disability of their member and due to the variable of age, and in favor of the age group of 11-15 years. The study recommended providing safe methods of communication with families of persons with disabilities to reduce the feeling of psychological isolation and loneliness as much as possible during the quarantine or curfew periods. CONCLUSIONS This study explored the levels of psychological and social adaptation of families of persons with disabilities in the time of COVID-19. The spread of the virus created a crisis in different counties and millions of people were infected. Persons with disabilities are among the categories affected most by the infection of the virus due to their weak immunity and their health problems. Therefore, response plans need to take measures that cover the needs of persons with disabilities and their families.","output":"The effect of the spread of the new COVID-19 on the psychological and social adaptation of families of persons with disabilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online systems that allow employees to pre-order their lunch may help reduce energy intake.

Employees (n = 30) placed a hypothetical lunch order through a pre-ordering website designed for their canteen while thinking aloud. Semi-structured interview questions supported data collection. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Acceptability was generally high, but potentially context dependent. Practical considerations, such as reminders to pre-order, user-friendliness, provision of images of menu items and energy information while browsing, an ability to reserve pre-ordered meals, and a swift collection service facilitated acceptability. The restrictive timeframe within which orders could be placed, a lack of opportunity to see foods before ordering, and prompts to swap being perceived as threatening autonomy were barriers to acceptability. Swap acceptance was facilitated by the provision of physical activity calorie equivalents (PACE) information, and swap similarity in terms of taste, texture, and expected satiety as well as the perception that alternatives provided meaningful energy savings.

Published investigation mostly on SARS-CoV and to extent on MERS has taught lessons to vaccination strategies to this novel coronavirus. This is attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV on host cell i.e. human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is approximately 79% similar genetically to SARS-CoV. Though the efforts on COVID-19 vaccines started very early, initially in China, as soon as the outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was declared a pandemic by WHO. But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries. Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances.

Psychological variables including depression, anxiety, loneliness, distress tolerance, life satisfaction, and well-being were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), short-form UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-6), Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), respectively. Structural equation modeling was employed to identify the pathways from the visibility of nature through windows to prisoners' life satisfaction and well-being. Our results demonstrated that visibility of nature promoted the frequency and duration of viewing nature through windows. The frequency directly affected well-being, but the duration did not effectively affect any measured variables. The visibility of nature enhanced life satisfaction mainly via direct effects but enhanced well-being mainly via indirect effects. Regarding the indirect pathways, the visibility of nature increased distress tolerance and thus reduced loneliness and mental health problems. The reduced mental health problem, in turn, promoted life satisfaction and well-being. Our findings suggest that nature exposure through windows is effective in enhancing prisoners' life satisfaction and well-being.

Some of the after-effects of the Fukushima Daiichi earthquake could have been eased if sensors had been in place inside the four reactors and sensed the overheating causing meltdown and steam explosions. The key element of ultrasonic sensors is the piezoelectric wafer, which is usually derived from lead-zirconate-titanate (Pb(Zr, Ti)O3, PZT). This material loses its piezoelectrical properties at a temperature of about 200 C. It also undergoes nuclear transmutation.

IDRLECA first hires an infection probability model to calculate the current infection probability of each individual. Then, the infection probabilities together with individuals' health status and movement information are fed to a novel GNN to estimate the spread of the virus through human contacts. The estimated risks are used to further support an RL agent to select individual-level epidemic-control actions. The training of IDRLECA is guided by a specially designed reward function considering both the cost of mobility intervention and the effectiveness of epidemic control.

Vaccines are the most promising prospect for COVID-19, but will need to be redeveloped for any future coronavirus outbreak.

Each lung lobe was evaluated for extent affected by ground-glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and consolidation, in five categories of percentual severity. Summation of scores from all five lung lobes provided the total CT score (maximal CT score, 25). RESULTS: The predominant patterns of lung abnormalities were GGOs, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities. The frequency of crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities peaked at stage-3 (62.7 %), stage-4 (75.0 %) and stage-5 (83.1 %), respectively, and decreased thereafter.

Skin hydration of perioral area was also decrease. There was significant difference in skin hydration decrease in the cheeks compared to the forehead. Compared to June, skin keratin was significantly increased on the cheeks. Skin keratin of perioral area was also increase on the perioral area and chin. There was significant difference in skin keratin increase in the cheeks and chin compared to the forehead. In previous studies, skin characteristics that were quickly affected by wearing a mask were skin temperature and redness. On the other hand, TEWL, skin hydration and keratin were more affected by wearing a mask for a long time so there was difference short-term and long-term effect of mask in changed skin characteristics. In this study, we identified the effect of long-term wearing a mask on the face skin. This result is meaningful in that we studied the effect of wearing a mask in daily life for ordinary people, not those who wear mask in the occupational environment.","output":"LB723 Face skin changes caused by face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beyond the tremendous grief and psychological toll, the loss of a parent often reduces income for the family;loss of a maternal parent in particular is associated with increases in malnutrition and death in sub-Saharan Africa 1,2 Orphaned children are at increased risk of loss of education 3 HIV is still a highly stigmatized condition in many places, and the loss of a parent combined with this stigmatization can lead to mental health issues such as depression Safety net policies, designed to prevent households from falling below a minimum threshold of poverty or health, could be deployed;indeed, decoupling health access from the abilityto pay through Universal Health Care Coverage policies is one of the most prominent of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (https://sdgs un org/goals) A 2014 observational study in South Africa found that \\"cash plus care\\" (microtransfer plus \\"care\\" in the form of positive parenting and teacher-mentor support) was the most effective measure at reducing HIV risk behavior in adolescent girls, and the only effective measure in adolescent boys","output":"Building \\"Bridges\\" to Equity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ECB announcement to reduce capital requirements for market risk to smooth pro-cyclicality, published in April 2020, is a good starting point to discuss the impact of regulation on individual banks on the stability of the whole banking and financial system.

The objectives of this systematic review was to determine the GI manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 and to evaluate their role as risk factors for a severe clinical course. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed and Scopus for studies published before December 31, 2020 with information about the GI manifestations of pediatric COVID-19. Patients with a severe and non-severe clinical course were compared using the inverse variance heterogeneity model and odds ratio (OR) as the effect size. A sensitivity analysis was performed if the heterogeneity was high among studies. RESULTS: A total of 811 studies were identified through systematic search of which 55 studies (4369 patients) were included in this systematic review. The commonest GI symptoms were diarrhea19.08%(95%CI : 10.6C28.2), nausea/vomiting 19.7%(95%CI : 7.8C33.2) and abdominal pain 20.3%(95%CI : 3.7C40.4).

The increasing number of patients might lead to enormous changes in psychological status of medical staff. Aims: The aim of this study was to understand the psychological status of medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: Medical staff working in hospitals in Wuhan and the Yangtze River Delta were invited to complete an online questionnaire, which was composed of basic demographic data, the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) for sleep disturbances, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) for anxiety, and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depressive symptoms. Results: Among the 1225 invited medical staff, 686 participants (64 males, 9.33% and 622 females, 90.67%;average age 33.137.82 years) responded to the survey (response rate was 56.00%). 482 (67.35%) respondents reported sleep disturbances, 224 (32.65%) reported anxiety and 204 (29.74%) reported depressive symptoms. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that occupation (doctor), department (respiratory, ICU), workplace (areas in Wuhan), marital status (married), and medical history (anxiety, depression or sleep disorders) were significantly correlated with AIS, GAD-7 and SDS scores (P<0.01). Conclusions: COVID-19 imposes a significant burden on mental health of medical staff. Gender, marital status, occupation, department, workplace and a specific medical history were major influencing factors for sleep disorders, anxiety and depressive symptoms among these front-line medical staff.

Though intended to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the lockdowns have had sweeping impacts on life in ways which were not originally planned. This studys purpose is to investigate the extent to which governmental responses to COVID-19 have impacted crime rates in the U.S. Compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, crime C as measured by calls for service to law enforcement C has decreased markedly. However, there are multiple indications that the crime drop is being driven by decreases in minor offenses which are typically committed in peer groups. At the same time, serious crimes which are generally not committed with co-offenders (namely homicide and intimate partner violence) have either remained constant or increased. As such, the crime drop appears to be hiding a very disturbing trend where homicides remain unchanged and intimate partner batteries are increasing. Since many offenders would presumably be committing less serious crimes in a non-pandemic world, we raise attention to the possibility that mandatory lockdown orders may have taken minor offenders and placed them into situations where there is rampant opportunity for intimate partner violence, serious batteries, and homicides.

This review focuses on that subset of ATMPs. One key mode of delivery that has enabling potential in ATMP validation is aerosol-mediated delivery. The selection of the most appropriate aerosol generator technology is influenced by several key factors, including formulation, patient type, patient intervention, and healthcare economics. The aerosol-mediated delivery of ATMPs has shown promise for the treatment of both chronic and acute respiratory disease in pre-clinical and clinical trials; however, in order for these ATMP device combinations to translate from the bench through to commercialization, they must meet the requirements set out by the various global regulatory bodies.

However, it is unclear whether the immune response of domestic birds reflects the response of their free-living counterparts naturally exposed to these viruses. We investigated the extent to which the innate humoral immune response was similar among (i) wild-type domestic mallards in primary and secondary infection with LPAIV H4N6 in a laboratory setting (laboratory mallards), (ii) wild-type domestic mallards naturally exposed to LPAIVs in a semi-natural setting (sentinel mallards), and (iii) free-living mallards naturally exposed to LPAIVs. We quantified innate humoral immune function by measuring non-specific natural antibodies (agglutination), complement activity (lysis), and the acute phase protein haptoglobin. We demonstrate that complement activity in the first 3 days after LPAIV exposure was higher in primary-exposed laboratory mallards than in sentinel and free-living mallards. LPAIV H4N6 likely activated the complement system and the acute phase response in primary-exposed laboratory mallards, as lysis was higher and haptoglobin lower at day 3 and 7 post-exposure compared to baseline immune function measured prior to exposure. There were no differences observed in natural antibody and haptoglobin concentrations among laboratory, sentinel, and free-living mallards in the first 3 days after LPAIV exposure. Our study demonstrates that, based on the three innate humoral immune parameters measured, domestic mallards seem an appropriate model to investigate innate immunology of their free-living counterparts, albeit the innate immune response of secondary-LPAIV exposed mallards is a better proxy for the innate immune response in pre-exposed free-living mallards than that of immunologically na?ve mallards.","output":"A Comparative Study of the Innate Humoral Immune Response to Avian Influenza Virus in Wild and Domestic Mallards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Barbed sutures are recently being employed in intracorporeal suturing in various laparoscopic digestive surgeries. The purpose of this paper was to present our initial experience of enterotomy closure with barbed sutures in upper gastrointestinal and bariatric surgeries, and share optimal technique of using such sutures for enterotomy closure. METHODS Fifty patients who underwent laparoscopic closure of enterotomies using barbed sutures were identified in two institutions in Singapore from January 2012 to December 2013. Patient demographics, short-term operative outcomes including anastomotic time, onset of diet, hospital stay, and early post-operative complications are reported. RESULTS In 50 patients a total of 62 anastomotic sites were closed with barbed sutures. The barbed sutures appear to reduce mean anastomotic suturing time of the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal closure (17.34 vs 44.55 min, p value 0.0001) and jejunojejunal closure (19.46 vs 31.01 min, p value 0.0013) when compared to a subgroup of patients with the same anastomotic sites closed using the standard non-barbed suture. The mean onset to start on diet was 2  1.5 days and mean duration of hospital stay is 7 + 5.3 days. One (1.6%) anastomotic leak was observed day 3 after a gastric bypass in the series. This leak was the result of a technical error due to inappropriate suturing technique. There were no mortalities, other complications or readmission. While applying traction on the suture brings two tissue edges closer, we observed that pushing the tissues toward each other provided more apposition and prevented unnecessary tearing of tissues that could potentially result in complications CONCLUSIONS Barbed closure sutures appear to be safe and effective in laparoscopic upper gastrointestinal procedures for closing enterotomies provided appropriate technique is used.

We contacted all the patients being treated at our IBD unit to identify those patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, following the World Health Organization case definition. Data were obtained by patient electronical medical records and by phone interview. RESULTS: Eighty-two of 805 patients with IBD (10.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.3-12.5) were diagnosed as having confirmed (28 patients, 3.5%; 95% CI, 2.4-5.0) or suspected (54 patients, 6.7%) infection. Patient age was 46  14 years, 44 patients were female (53.7%), 17.3% were smokers, 51.2% had Crohn disease (CD), and 39.0% had comorbidities. Digestive symptoms were reported in 41 patients (50.0%), with diarrhea as the most common (42.7%). One patient (1.2%) was diagnosed with IBD flare-up during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Twenty-two patients (26.8%) temporarily withdrew from their IBD treatment because of COVID-19. Most of the patients had mild disease (79.3%), and 1 patient died (1.2%). In the multivariate analysis, the presence of dyspnea was associated with moderate to severe infection (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.6-17.7; P = 0.01) and myalgias (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.3-17.9; P = 0.02) were related to a milder clinical course. Immunosuppression was not related to severity. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD is not rare. Dyspnea is associated with a more severe infection. Therapy for IBD, including immunomodulators and biologic therapy, is not related to a greater severity of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 infections do not appear to be related to IBD flare-ups.","output":"Incidence, Clinical Characteristics, and Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Single-Center Study in Madrid, Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnosis is a crucial precautionary step in research studies of the coronavirus disease, which shows indications similar to those of various pneumonia types.

The results showed significant relationships between the four measured variables. A bimodal distribution was observed in the variables related to psychological flexibility. The multiple regression showed that difficulties in self as context, committed actions and defusion explain a high percentage of the variance of parental stress and general psychological health.

METHODS: Patients with confirmed history of COVID infection and persistent symptoms were referred to the Post-COVID Recovery Clinic. Standardized telehealth screening included: Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), Shortness of Breath (SOBQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), CDC 18 common symptom COVID, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD7), and (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living (I)ADL. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were evaluated in the first 2.5 months. Average age was 52 years (23C90), 67% were female, and 58% Caucasian. COVID+ test to clinic visit was 49 days (14C140). Forty eight percent did not require hospitalization, 62% were obese, and 73% had 1 comorbidity. At infection onset, 80% complained of GI symptoms (75% loss of taste, 61% loss of smell, 59% diarrhea, 57% nausea). At the telehealth visit, 51% reported lingering GI symptoms (45% taste, 41% smell, 41% diarrhea, 36% nausea). Other common symptoms were: dyspnea on exertion, chronic fatigue, cough, and weakness. Survivors required referrals for the following specialty services: 84% pulmonary, 77% physical/occupational therapy, 73% behavioral health, and 51% registered dietitian consult. Average PG-SGA score was 5.7  5.02 with sub-scores: weight 1.37  1.65, food 0.58  0.64, symptoms 2.19  3.30, activities/function 1.59  0.93. Preliminary analysis of 2-day 24h dietary recalls of a subset of clinic patients (n = 33) found >50% of COVID survivors failed to meet basic dietary recommendations. Daily caloric intake was low, protein intake was below 0.8 g/kg, and the daily distribution of protein skewed towards a single meal. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the clinical symptoms experienced by COVID survivors, particularly fatigue, dyspnea, and eating difficulties (nausea, vomiting, changes in smell and taste, trouble breathing) created difficulties in maintaining an adequate nutritional intake. This is concerning because malnutrition, specifically inadequate protein, leads to weaker immune function, slower recovery from illness, and loss of lean body mass.

These infections are due to sequence variation in the spike protein leading to a reduction in protection afforded by the current vaccines, which are based on the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, or by natural infection with pre-Omicron strains. Methods In a longitudinal cohort study, pre-breakthrough infection sera for Omicron breakthroughs (n=12) were analyzed. Assays utilized include a laboratory-developed solid phase binding assay to recombinant spike protein, a commercial assay to the S1 domain of the spike protein calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, and a commercial solid-phase surrogate neutralizing activity (SNA) assay. All assays employed spike protein preparations based on sequences from the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Participant demographics and clinical characteristics were captured. Results Pre-breakthrough binding antibody (bAB) titers ranged from 1:800-1:51,200 for the laboratory-developed binding assay, which correlated well and agreed quantitatively with the commercial spike S1 domain WHO calibrated assay. SNA was detected in 10/12 (83%) samples. Conclusions Neither high bAB nor SNA were markers of protection from Omicron infection/re-infection. Laboratory tests with antigen targets based on Wuhan-Hu-1 may not accurately reflect the degree of immune protection from variants with significant spike protein differences. Omicron breakthrough infections are likely due to high sequence variation of the spike protein and reflect incomplete immune protection from previous infection with strains that preceded Omicron or with vaccinations based on the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain.","output":"Permissive Omicron breakthrough infections in individuals with binding or neutralizing antibodies to ancestral SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE PRESENTATION A 30-year-old man with a history of childhood asthma, a 15-pack-year smoking history, and methamphetamine abuse was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation because of acute hypoxic respiratory failure after experiencing progressive dyspnea and a nonproductive cough over the previous year.

On the other hand, collective tragedies, especially those involving infectious diseases, often increase waves of fear and anxiety that appear to cause widespread behavioral disturbances and threaten the mental health of many people in the population. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of coronavirus anxiety on self-esteem, life satisfaction and mood of women with moderate to moderate physical activity during the Covid-19 quarantine period. Material and Methods: The present study is a descriptive survey study. The sample consisted of 165 women with regular moderate physical activity who participated in the study through available sampling through telegram and WhatsApp virtual networks by distributing online questionnaire link. Required data through standard questionnaires including coronary anxiety Alipour, Brumez Mood Scale (BRUMS) Items, Life satisfaction of Diener. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES) and IPAQ physical activity questionnaire was provided. Data in SPSS 26 software were analyzed using descriptive statistics and path analysis using SMARTPLS software. Results The results showed that anxiety caused by coronavirus had a significant inverse effect on self-esteem (P = -0.238) and life satisfaction (P = -0.307) of women with moderate-to-moderate physical activity during coronavirus 19 quarantine, and has a positive and significant effect on mood (P = 0.573) of women with regular moderate physical activity and their model has a good fit (p &lt;0.05). Conclusion: Coronary anxiety disorder plays an important role in the self-esteem, life satisfaction, and mood of women with moderate-to-moderate physical activity during the Covid-19 quarantine period.

Methods: This cross-national survey was conducted between April 1 and October 15, 2020 and utilized a self-administered questionnaire to collect data (Typeform TM) from people living with hemophilia in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia. The questionnaire included 22 questions regarding difficulties in daily life and preferences for receiving hemophilia-related information. Respondents were stratified into two main groups, people with hemophilia (PwH) or their caregivers (CPwH). Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Of the 364 respondents, 232 were PwH (63.7%) and 132 were CPwH (36.3%). In total, 70.3% of hemophilia patients/caregivers responded that they are kept sufficiently informed about life with hemophilia, with 68.0%, 59.1% and 56.3% of respondents obtaining information from their physicians, patient associations and via digital media (internet and social media), respectively. However, 97.8% of respondents expressed an interest in additional information, particularly new hemophilia treatment options (62.1%), which in contrast to other topics was indicated most frequently by both patients and caregivers in all six countries. Most frequent difficulties in everyday life with hemophilia were identified as mobility problems (41.8%), unexpected bleeding (38.5%), pain (35.4%), and uncertainty with what they can or cannot do (25.0%). During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, 52.5% of respondents reported that they did not experience any major change in daily living with hemophilia. Conclusion: Based on our Central European survey, hemophilia mostly affects peoples' lives by causing mobility difficulties, unexpected bleeding, pain and uncertainty in daily activities. Although the majority of respondents reported being educated about hemophilia, most PwH and CPwH respondents sought additional information, highlighting the need for continuous personalized patient education to cope with present challenges.","output":"A Cross-National Survey of People Living with Hemophilia: Impact on Daily Living and Patient Education in Central Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Jordan Stillbirths and Neonatal Deaths Surveillance system (JSANDS) is a newly developed system and is currently implemented in five large hospitals in Jordan This study aimed at exploring the healthcare professionals' perception about the usability of JSANDS METHODS: A descriptive qualitative approach, using focus group discussions, was adopted A total of 5 focus groups including 23 focal points were conducted in five participating hospitals in Jordan RESULTS: Data analysis identified nine main issues related to the JSANDS system: the system usefulness, the system performance, data quality, the system limitations, human rights, female empowerment, nurses' competencies strengthened, the sustainability of the JSANDS, and COVID-19 impact on the system Users reported that JSANDS data were useful, the system was simple and easy to use, and the data were accurate and complete However, some users reported that some technical issues need to be enhanced CONCLUSIONS: JSANDS was perceived positively by the current users According to them, it provides a formative and comprehensive data on stillbirths and neonatal deaths and their causes, and therefore, was recommended to be adopted by its users and scaled up","output":"The usability of Jordan stillbirths and neonatal deaths surveillance (JSANDS) system: results of focus group discussions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural or manmade disasters, mass causality events, and other emergencies can disrupt healthcare delivery and change the demand for healthcare services. In order to protect patients, staff, and facilities it is essential that healthcare facilities be prepared for such emergency events. Ambulatory surgery centers (ASC) and Office Based Anesthesia (OBA) practices are unique healthcare settings that necessitate specific emergency planning since they typically do not have rapid response or code teams on site. In addition, they typically operate with fewer personnel and have staff members who often perform multiple functions. Previously there has been variability in the emergency preparedness amongst ASCs and OBA practices. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has recently identified three requirements for maintaining healthcare services during an emergency. These are 1) safeguarding human resources, 2) maintaining business operations, and 3) protecting physical resources. In 2016 CMS issued new rules establishing national emergency preparedness requirements for Medicare and Medicaid participating providers in the United States. In addition there are requirements specifically for ASCs and OBAs. The first step in emergency preparedness is performing a risk assessment for a practice using an all-hazards approach. In this approach, the practice attempts to identify all hazards that could potentially affect the practice as well as evaluating the likelihood of such hazards. This risk assessment is then incorporated into an emergency plan for the facility. In addition to reviewing specific components of an emergency plan for ASCs and OBAs, the need to test the plan and create a subsequent corrective action plan is reviewed. It is important that healthcare providers at all ambulatory surgery centers and office based anesthesia practices are aware of regulations for emergency preparedness and work to ensure that patients, staff and physical resources are protected during natural disasters and other emergencies.","output":"Emergency Preparedness in Ambulatory Surgery Centers and Office-Based Anesthesia Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Over a year after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic with its lockdowns and social distancing requirements, being together with others again seems possible.

METHODS: To begin answering these questions, the current research surveyed would-be attendees at one of Europe's largest outdoor music festivals (n = 18353). Drawing on social psychological theories of crowd behavior and risk perception, we explored the identity processes that contributed to individual feelings of safety within the planned event. RESULTS: The results show that shared identity with other festival goers and the perception of collectivistic (versus individualistic) values as defining of that festival, contributed to more trust in relevant others, stronger expectations that others would behave with safety rather than risk, and through these increased comfort with, and acceptance of the risks presented by, the planned festival.

As healthcare systems evolve in the face of COVID-19, the use of telehealth platforms has expanded. We present the results of a large survey of patient perspectives on the role of telehealth in the care of spine clinic patients. METHODS All patients at the spine clinic of a large, tertiary, academic medical center were surveyed at their clinic visit from 5/30/20-6/30/20. All responses were anonymous and results were analyzed with standard statistical techniques. RESULTS 176 surveys were returned and 164 were entirely completed. 56.8% of patients were new while 24.4% were post-operative follow-up visits. 54.9% had lumbar symptoms. 85% had pain while more than half also reported weakness. 58% traveled greater than twenty-five miles for their appointment. 96% had transportation readily available. Of all respondents, only 15.3% preferred the appointment via video telehealth while 4% had no preference between in-person appointment or virtual visit. Preference for telehealth appointment was not associated with factors such as new or established in the practice, spinal region of symptoms, pain, weakness, comfort with technology, age or duration of symptoms. There was a significant difference between how far the patient traveled for the clinic appointment and their preference for a telehealth appointment, with patients traveling further distances favoring telehealth (p=0.04). This effect remained significant when stratifying based on 25 miles (p=0.03) or 50 miles (p=0.03) but not when stratifying based on 100 miles (p=0.32). However, the sample size of patients traveling >100 miles was small, limiting any inference regarding that subgroup. Access to transportation was associated with preference for telehealth (88.89% vs. 97.18%, p=0.08) but did not reach statistical significance.

These preferences should be considered when arranging patient encounters.","output":"Telemedicine in a spine clinic setting: a large survey of patient preferences and experiences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Zika virus (ZIKV) can induce inflammation in immunoprivileged organs (e.g., the brain and testis), leading to the Guillain-Barr syndrome and damaging the testes. During an infection with the ZIKV, immune cells have been shown to infiltrate into the tissues. However, the cellular mechanisms that define the protection and/or immunopathogenesis of these immune cells during a ZIKV infection are still largely unknown. Herein, we describe methods to evaluate the virus-specific T-cell functionality in these immunoprivileged organs of ZIKV-infected mice.

Interventions Telemedicine services included teleconsultations and telephysiotherapy. They lasted as long as usual interventions. They were delivered using free teleconference Apps, caregivers were actively involved, interviews and counselling were performed as usual. Teleconsultations included standard, but adapted measurements and evaluations in video and from photos/videos sent in advance according to specific tutorials. During telephysiotherapy, new sets of exercises were defined and recorded as usual. Main Outcome Measure(s) We compared the number of services provided in three phases, among them and with corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019: during CONTROL (30 working days) and COVID surge (13 days) only usual consultations/physiotherapy were provided, while during TELEMED (15 days) only teleconsultations/telephysiotherapy. If a reliable medical decision was not possible during teleconsultations, usual face-to-face interventions were prescribed. Continuous quality improvement questionnaires were also evaluated. Results During TELEMED, 325 teleconsulations and 882 telephysiotherapy sessions were provided in 15 days. We found a rapid decrease (-39%) of outpatient services from CONTROL to COVID phase (R2=0.85), partially recovered in TELEMED for telephysiotherapy (from -37% to -21%; p<0.05), and stabilised for teleconsultation (from -55% to -60%) interventions. Usual face-to-face interventions have been needed by 0.5% of patients.

During the pandemic lockdown, subjective impressions of exposure to aerosolized HOCl were submitted as self-reported responses by employees of a machine-tool shop located in Tacoma, Washington, about 35 miles from Seattle. At that location exposure to HOCl was adopted by a subset of employees as a routine for entry into the facilities. Under short-term, controlled conditions those individuals breathed HOCl misted from a reservoir containing 180 ppm free active chlorine (FAC). Their reports were used to arrive at inferences regarding the effects of exposure. Chemical and antimicrobial characterizations of the aerosols used for these exposures were also performed. Results are discussed in relation to (1) published accounts of HOCl preparations and their effects on respiratory viruses, including rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, and (2) the potential for rational intervention in infections arising from aerosolized pathogens, including the pandemic SARS-CoV-2, using inhalation as a method for administration of HOCl.","output":"Inhalation of a fog of hypochlorous acid (HOCl): Biochemical, antimicrobial, and pathological assessment (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this narrative study is to explain the role that musicking plays in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic for 11 South African musicians. The research question is: How do the stories of 11 South African musicians explain the role that musicking plays in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic? There have been studies on how music helps in therapeutic and everyday settings, but there has been limited research on the role musicking plays in coping with pandemics. The 11 author-participants in the study have lived through this pandemic, and their stories served as the data. We used a narrative coding scheme to enable co-coding. Our findings are a collaborative interpretation of our analyses and are represented as a fictionalized dialogue. This dialogue revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a range of psychological effects on the participant researchers. Musicking contributed to proactive and reactive coping strategies, including listening to music actively, making music with others virtually and in their homes, finding solidarity through engaging with musical icons, allowing them to connect with others, escape, focus, relax, and find hedonic well-being and hope. Further research will be needed to understand the roles musicking may play in coping with pandemics.","output":"Stories of the role musicking plays in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient: Female, 46-year-old Final Diagnosis: COVID provoked thromboembolism Symptoms: Cough ? dyspnea Medication: Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Infectious Diseases ? General and Internal Medicine OBJECTIVE: Unknown ethiology BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurs because of a novel enveloped ribonucleic acid coronavirus called severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). One of the major reported complications of COVID-19 includes both arterial and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Here we describe a case of COVID-19 provoked pulmonary embolism in a young patient already receiving prophylactic treatment for VTE. CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old female with past medical history of diabetes mellites, hypertension, and asthma presented in the emergency department (ED) with dyspnea requiring 6 liters per minute of oxygen on presentation. Her main complaints were cough and vomiting. In the ED, hypoxemia worsened, and she ultimately required endotracheal intubation. Labs were suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and showed increase in all inflammatory markers and absolute lymphocytopenia. Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse patchy airspace opacities. Standard DKA management was started. She was also started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and subcutaneous heparin (5000 U every 8 h) for VTE prophylaxis. SARS-Cov2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction returned positive. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were discontinued the very next day because of low suspicion of bacterial infection while hydroxychloroquine was completed for 5 days. On the third day of admission, the patient self-extubated and was immediately placed on nonrebreather with spO(2) in low 90s. On the fourth day of admission, D-dimer came back 4.74 mg/L, which was elevated from a prior value, so computed tomography angiography of the lungs was done, which disclosed multiple emboli in the lungs. She was started on therapeutic doses of enoxaparin sodium, which was continued through her admission. She was switched to Apixaban on discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of the case suggested that low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent VTE in COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of these patients may benefit from receiving prophylactic half doses or full doses of anticoagulants.","output":"A 46-Year-Old Woman Who Presented with Diabetic Ketoacidosis and COVID-19 Pneumonia with Multiple Pulmonary Thromboemboli: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the emergence of the coronavirus disease (COVID 19), education systems in most countries have adapted and quickly changed their teaching strategy to online teaching.

We review the growing literature that considers emerging poverty impacts, noting that there remain significant knowledge gaps due to limited evidence on current welfare outcomes. We analyze pre\\\\Covid survey data to examine the incidence of chronic poverty and downward mobility during a period of rapid economic growth and declining poverty. A profile of poverty during such a period might offer a plausible, partial, window on population groups currently at risk. We suggest that, notwithstanding the severe initial impacts of the crisis on poverty, there are grounds for expecting further consequences going forward. As the virus has spread out of the relatively affluent cities, and as economic stagnation persists, rural areas, with historically higher rates of chronic poverty and vulnerability, may see particularly sharp increases in poverty.

METHODS: 403 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited and prospectively followed-up at a major hospital in the United Arab Emirates. The primary endpoint was time from admission until the development of a composite outcome, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death from any cause. Patients discharged alive were considered as competing events to the primary outcome. Competing risk regression was used to quantify the association between suPAR and the incidence of the primary outcome. RESULTS: 6.2% of patients experienced ARDS or ICU admission, but none died. Taking into account competing risk, the incidence of the primary outcome was 11.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-16.3) in patients with suPAR levels >3.91 ng/mL compared to 2.9% (95% CI, 0.4-5.5) in those with suPAR &#8804;3.91 ng/mL. Also, an increase by 1 ng/mL in baseline suPAR resulted in a 58% rise in the hazard of developing the primary outcome (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% CI, 1.2-2.1, p = 0.003).

The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on educational systems has further increased the significance of e-learning. Accordingly, gaining a full understanding of the general topics and trends in e-learning studies is critical for a deeper comprehension of the field. There are many studies that provide such a picture of the e-learning field, but the limitation is that they do not examine the field as a whole. This study aimed to investigate the emerging trends in the e-learning field by implementing a topic modeling analysis based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on 41,925 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2019. The analysis revealed 16 topics reflecting emerging trends and developments in the e-learning field. Among these, the topics MOOC, learning assessment, and elearning systems were found to be key topics in the field, with a consistently high volume. In addition, the topics of learning algorithms, learning factors, and adaptive learning were observed to have the highest overall acceleration, with the first two identified as having a higher acceleration in recent years. Going by these results, it is concluded that the next decade of e-learning studies will focus on learning factors and algorithms, which will possibly create a baseline for more individualized and adaptive mobile platforms. In other words, after a certain maturity level is reached by better understanding the learning process through these identified learning factors and algorithms, the next generation of e-learning systems will be built on individualized and adaptive learning environments. These insights could be useful for e-learning communities to improve their research efforts and their applications in the field accordingly. ? 2021.

Despite many efforts made, the existing representation learning or feature generation approaches of both drugs and proteins remain complicated as well as in high dimension. In addition, it is difficult for current methods to extract local important residues from sequence information while remaining focused on global structure. At the same time, massive data is not always easily accessible, which makes model learning from small datasets imminent. As a result, we propose an end-to-end learning model with SUPD and SUDD methods to encode drugs and proteins, which not only leave out the complicated feature extraction process but also greatly reduce the dimension of the embedding matrix. Meanwhile, we use a multi-view strategy with a transformer to extract local important residues of proteins for better representation learning.

Using weekly records of viral test results for each state in the US, I demonstrate how confirmed case counts can be adjusted based on the percentage of COVID-19 tests that come back positive. A regression analysis indicates that case counts track better with future hospitalizations and deaths when employing this simple adjustment for testing coverage.

METHODS: In this population-based analysis, we used a test-negative design across four immune-mediated inflammatory disease population-based cohorts, comprising individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. We identified all SARS-CoV-2 tests done in these populations between March 1 and Nov 22, 2021 (a period in which there was rapid uptake of vaccines, and the alpha [B.1.1.7] and delta [B.1.617.2] SARS-CoV-2 variants were predominantly circulating in Canada) and separately assessed outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation due to COVID-19 and death due to COVID-19) for each disease group. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the effectiveness of one, two, and three doses of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [PfizerCBioNTech], or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) among individuals at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. FINDINGS: Between March 1 and Nov 22, 2021, we identified 2127 (59%) test-positive cases among 36 145 individuals (26 476 [732%] were female and 9669 [268%] were male) with rheumatoid arthritis tested, 476 (61%) test-positive cases among 7863 individuals (4130 [525%] were female and 3733 [475%] were male) with ankylosing spondylitis tested, 3089 (65%) test-positive cases among 47 199 individuals (26 062 [552%] were female and 21 137 [448%] were male) with psoriasis tested, and 1702 (54%) test-positive cases among 31 311 individuals (17 716 [566%] were female and 13 595 [434%] were male) with inflammatory bowel disease tested. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness of two doses against infection was 83% (95% CI 80C86) in those with rheumatoid arthritis, 89% (83C93) among those with ankylosing spondylitis, 84% (81C86) among those with psoriasis, and 79% (74C82) among those with inflammatory bowel disease. After two vaccine doses, effectiveness against infection generally peaked 31C60 days after vaccination and waned gradually with each additional month. Vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes after two doses was 92% (95% CI 88C95) in those with rheumatoid arthritis, 97% (83C99) among those with ankylosing spondylitis, 92% (86C95) among those with psoriasis, and 94% (88C97) among those with inflammatory bowel disease. Vaccine effectiveness after a third dose against infection was similar to or higher than after the second dose (ranging from 76% [47C89] to 96% [72C99]), although due to a paucity of events, estimates could not be calculated for some subgroups for severe outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Two vaccine doses were found to be highly effective against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease during the study period. Research is needed to determine the durability of effectiveness of three doses over time, particularly against emerging variants.

The first biologically active thymic extract was thymosin fraction V, the fractionation of which led to the isolation of a series of immunoactive polypeptides, including prothymosin alpha (proT). ProT displays a dual role, intracellularly as a survival and proliferation mediator and extracellularly as a biological response modifier. Accordingly, inside the cell, proT is implicated in crucial intracellular circuits and may serve as a surrogate tumor biomarker, but when found outside the cell, it could be used as a therapeutic agent for treating immune system deficiencies. In fact, proT possesses pleiotropic adjuvant activity and a series of immunomodulatory effects (eg, anticancer, antiviral, neuroprotective, cardioprotective). Moreover, several reports suggest that the variable activity of proT might be exerted through different parts of the molecule. We first reported that the main immunoactive region of proT is the carboxy-terminal decapeptide proT(100C109). In conjunction with data from others, we also revealed that proT and proT(100C109) signal through Toll-like receptor 4. Although their precise molecular mechanism of action is yet not fully elucidated, proT and proT(100C109) are viewed as candidate adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy.

To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients.

We investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-COVID bays, in the context of various scenarios: placing the initially-exposed individual in different beds, varying the recovery and incubation periods, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (COVID-only) hospital bays.","output":"Modelling the transmission of infectious diseases inside hospital bays: implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduo A pandemia global da doen?a de coronavrus 2019 (COVID-19) causada pelo novo vrus de sndrome respiratria aguda grave coronavrus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) come?ou em Wuhan, China, em dezembro de 2019 e afetou mais de 4,4 milh?es de pessoas em todo o mundo, com 302 169 mortes at o dia 16 de maio de 2020 1 Embora os sintomas respiratrios sejam a apresentao mais comum de COVID-19, o envolvimento cardaco  uma caracterstica proeminente dessa doen?a, ocorrendo em 20% a 30% dos pacientes hospitalizados e contribuindo para 40% dos bitos 2-4 O envolvimento cardaco relacionado  COVID-19 tem sido documentado por elevaes em biomarcadores cardacos e frequentemente apresenta alteraes no segmento ST-T no eletrocardiograma (ECG) de 12 derivaes, motivo pelo qual a equipe do laboratrio de cateterismo  frequentemente ativada Alm disso, as atividades do laboratrio de cateterismo devem continuar no atendimento a pacientes n?o COVID-19 que apresentam sndrome coronariana aguda (SCA) verdadeira, infarto do miocrdio com supradesnivelamento do segmento ST (IAMCSST) e doen?a cardaca isqumica estvel muito sintomtica Devido  escalada no nmero de casos de COVID-19 na cidade de S?o Paulo, epicentro da doen?a no Brasil, reformularam-se a logstica e as prticas no laboratrio de cateterismo cardaco do Instituto Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia, que entraram em vigor em abril de 2020 e continuar?o durante o perodo da pandemia Os objetivos s?o fornecer atendimento otimizado  populao que necessita de procedimentos cardacos invasivos durante a pandemia, com a proteo adequada aos profissionais de sade (PS), pacientes e seus familiares Os protocolos aqui descritos representam os esfor?os multidisciplinares e dinamicos do Departamento de Cardiologia Invasiva do Instituto Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia validados pelo Comit de Controle de Infeco da instituio Essas prticas est?o sujeitas a alteraes em funo do estado epidemiolgico local, a fase da epidemia e a disponibilidade de equipamento de proteo individual (EPI) Estes protocolos podem n?o se aplicar a outras localidades sem casos (ou casos espordicos) de COVID-19 ou a servi?os que atendem diferentes perfis populacionais com logsticas e disponibilidade de EPI diversas","output":"Adequao das prticas do laboratrio de cateterismo durante a pandemia de COVID-19: O protocolo do Instituto Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Orbital and peri-orbital venolymphatic malformations (VLM) are low flow vascular malformations.

This study, as part of the global CoVaST project, aimed to assess the occurrence of short-term adverse events (SRAEs) of two most administered COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA-based (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and viral vector-based (AstraZeneca) in healthcare sector workers (HWs). Methods: A cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out for the first time among 317 Polish healthcare sector personnel and medical students using a validated and pre-tested questionnaire. The online questionnaire included 25 pre-tested, validated questions concerning demographic data, medical parameters, COVID-19-related anamneses, and local or systemic reactions (reactogenicity) associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Descriptive statistics, inferential tests and binary logistic regression were performed. Results: Out of the 247 participating HWs, 79.8% were females, and 77.5% received mRNA-based vaccines, while 24.5% received a viral vector-based vaccine. Cumulatively, 78.9% and 60.7% of the participants reported at least one local and one systemic SRAE respectively, following their COVID-19 first or second dose of vaccine. A wide array of SRAEs was observed, while pain at injection site (76.9%) was the most common local SRAE, and fatigue (46.2%), headache (37.7%), muscle pain (31.6%) were the most common systemic SRAEs. The vast proportion of local (35.2%) and systemic (44.8%) SRAEs subsided up to 1 day after inoculation with both types of vaccines. The mRNA-based vaccine versions seem to cause higher prevalence of local SRAEs, mainly pain within injection site (81.3% vs. 71.7%; p = 0.435), while the viral vector-based vaccine was linked with increased incidents of mild systemic side effects (76.7% vs. 55.3%; p = 0.004) after both doses. Pooled analysis revealed uniform results while comparing the prevalence of SRAEs in HWs as recipients in four central European countries (OR = 2.38; 95% CI = 2.03C2.79). Conclusions: The study confirmed the safety of commonly administered vaccines against COVID-19, which were associated with mild, self-resolving adverse events. No major vaccine-related incidents were reported which would affect every day functioning, significantly. The younger age group (below 29 y.o.) were associated with an increased risk of adverse events generally.

High age, several comorbidities as well as poor physical fitness can negatively influence the outcome within COVID-19 infection. We investigated whether the ratio of fat to muscle area, measured in initial LDCT, can predict severe progression of COVID-19 in the follow-up period. METHOD: We analyzed 58 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection that underwent an initial LDCT in one of two included centers due to COVID-19 infection. Using the ratio of waist circumference per paravertebral muscle circumference (FMR), the body composition was estimated. Patient outcomes were rated on an ordinal scale with higher numbers representing more severe progression or disease associated complications (hospitalization/ intensive care unit (ICU)/ tracheal intubation/ death) within a follow-up period of 22 days after initial LDCT. RESULTS: In the initial LDCT a significantly higher FMR was found in patients requiring intensive care treatment within the follow-up period. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, FMR (pa?<a?.001) in addition to age (pa?<a?.01), was found to be a significant predictor of the necessity for ICU treatment of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: FMR as potential surrogate of body composition and obesity can be easily determined in initial LDCT of COVID-19 patients. Within the multivariate analysis, in addition to patient age, low muscle area in proportion to high fat area represents an additional prognostic information for the patient outcome and the need of an ICU treatment during the follow-up period within the next 22 days. This multicentric pilot study presents a method using an initial LDCT to screen opportunistically for obese patients who have an increased risk for the need of ICU treatment.

METHODS: The questionnaire was distributed electronically to 206 transplant centers for heart (n = 11), lung (n = 10), liver (n = 25), kidney (n = 130), pancreas (n = 18), and small intestine (n = 12) transplantation. Organ donations and organ transplantation data were extracted from the Japan Organ Transplant Network website. RESULTS: We received questionnaire responses from 177 centers (response rate, 86%). In 2020, the number of brain-dead donors (BDDs) decreased to 68 (69% of the year-on-year average) and the number of donors after cardiac death (DCDs) decreased to 9 (32% of the year-on-year average). Eighty-five (48%) transplant centers (heart, n = 0; lung, n = 0; liver, n = 4; kidney, n = 78; pancreas, n = 22; and small intestine, n = 0) suspended transplant surgeries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the number of organ transplantations from deceased donors was significantly lower in 2020 than in 2019. CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has had less impact in Japan than in other countries, it has affected transplantation activity significantly, suspending transplantation surgeries in 48% of the transplantation centers, including 78% of the kidney transplantation centers, and reducing the number of organ donations to 61% of the year-on-year average.","output":"National survey on deceased donor organ transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Morocco two waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been recorded. The first one occurred from March 02, 2020 with infections mostly imported from Europe and the second one dominated by local infections. At the time of writing, the genetic diversity of Moroccan isolates of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to analyze first the genomic variation of the twenty-eight Moroccan strains of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from March 03, 2020 to May 15, 2020, to compare their distributions with twelve other viral genomes from North Africa as well as to identify their possible sources. Our finding revealed 61 mutations in the Moroccan genomes of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019, of them 23 (37.7%) were present in two or more genomes. Focusing on non-synonymous mutations, 29 (47.54%) were distributed in five genes (ORF1ab, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and ORF3a) with variable frequencies. The non-structural protein coding regions nsp3-Multi domain and nsp12-RdRp of the ORF1ab gene harbored more mutations, with six for each. The comparison of genetic variants of fourty North African strains revealed that two non-synonymous mutations D614G (in spike) and Q57H (in ORF3a) were common in four countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt), with a prevalence of 92.5% (n = 37) and 42.5% (n = 17), respectively, of the total genomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Moroccan and Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 strains were closely related to those from different origins (Asia, Europe, North and South America) and distributed in different distinct subclades. This could indicate different sources of infection with no specific strain dominating yet in in these countries. These results have the potential to lead to new comprehensive investigations combining genomic data, epidemiological information and the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from North Africa: viral origins and mutational spectrum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Lymphoid malignancies are a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Vaccination with BNT162b2 protects the general population from severe disease, but recent studies have shown limited seroconversion after vaccination in patients with lymphoid malignancy. This reduced response is likely related to disease and treatment factors altering both humoral and cellular immunity. Assessing response in patients with the indolent lymphomas, Waldenstr?m's Macroglobulinaemia (WM) and Follicular Lymphoma (FL), including cohorts on differing treatment regimens, may help elucidate some of these factors. Australia has had low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to date, affording a unique opportunity to assess efficacy to vaccination without the confounding impact of endemic infection. Methods Patients with WM and FL and controls were enrolled in a prospective study of immune response after two doses of BNT162b2 administered 21 days apart. The study had Human Research Ethics Committee approval and all patients gave informed consent prior to participation. Recruitment was targeted to obtain comparable proportions of controls to treatment cohorts. PBMC and sera were collected from participants immediately prior to the first dose (T1), at day 21 immediately prior to the second dose (T2), and day 49 (+/- 7d) (T3). Immune response was measured by: flow cytometric detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies (ASAb), performed using our recently validated flow cytometric live cell assay (Tea et.al. PLoS Medicine 2021) with increased sensitivity compared to currently available commercial ELISAs; live virus neutralisation to a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern; and CD4+and CD8+ antigen-specific T cell responses. Statistical analysis of medians between cohorts were compared by the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test using Graphpad Prism. Initial ASAb IgG data for T1 and T2 is presented here. Complete immune response data at all time points will be available for the ASH meeting. Results Eighty-five participants received their first dose of BNT162b2 from 18 May 2021 to 7 June 2021 with a second dose 21 days later: 72 lymphoma patients (WM and FL) and 13 age-matched healthy volunteers (controls). Of 37 with WM [19 (51.3%) female, median 71 years (IQR 63-74)] 9 were treatment na?ve (WMN), 15 had received rituximab-chemotherapy (WMT), and 13 were currently treated with a Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor (BTKi): 5 ibrutinib, 8 zanubrutinib (WMB). Of 35 patients with FL [16 (45.7%) female, median 65 years (IQR 54-71)], 11 were treatment na?ve (FLN), and 24 had received rituximab-chemotherapy (FLT). Of the 13 controls 8 (61.5%) were female, median age 72 years (IQR 57-74)]. No participants had detectable ASAb at T1, confirming no prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Figure 1 shows ASAb results at T2. The median mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of healthy controls: 60802 (IQR 17565 -78443), is higher than all WM: 0 (IQR 0 - 15010) p<0.0001, and all FL patients: 1687 (IQR 0 - 25421) p=0.002, Fig 1A. The median MFI of controls was higher than WMN (p=0.036), but not higher than FLN (p=0.28). The median MFI of WMN: 20074 (IQR 5421 - 35695), is higher than WMB: 0 (IQR 0 - 4217) p=0.018, but not significantly higher than WMT: 0 (IQR 0 - 14356) p=0.13, Fig 1B. Median MFI of FLN: 31476 (IQR 19351 - 51317), is higher than FLT: 0 (IQR 0 - 32849) p=0.01, Fig 1B. Conclusion These early serological data show measurable ASAb in all healthy controls 21 days post first dose of BNT162b2 vaccination. Treatment na?ve patients had a better response than treated patients, and this did not differ significantly to healthy controls in the FL cohort. In WM, patients on BTKi had a significantly reduced response compared to treatment-na?ve patients. This same reduction was not observed in the chemotherapy-rituximab cohort, but the characteristics of early responders versus non-responders, including time since last therapy, is being analysed. FL patients treated with chemotherapy-rituximab had a significantly reduced response compared to the treatment-na?ve cohort. Time constraints before the abstract submission deadline prevented reporting of all mature vaccination response data. Measurement of ASAb one month after second vaccination, live virus neutralisation to a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, and CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific T cell responses at T1, T2 and T3, to fully characterise the immune response to BNT162b2, will be reported at the ASH meeting.

With Landsat 5/7/8 images and Google Earth Engine (GEE), an improved threshold-based water extraction algorithm and a novel surface water gaps (SWGs) interpolation method based on historical water frequency were applied to build surface water area (SWA, namely SWE without ice) and water body area (WBA, namely SWE with ice) monthly (January 2001-December 2019) and annual (1986-2019) time series in the upper reaches of the Yellow River (UYR). The Mann-Kendall test was used to analyse SWE trends, and the ridge regression was performed to figure out the relative contributions of meteorological factors to SWE dynamics. The pixels with modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) higher than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were identified as SWE. The mean relative error (MRE) of the SWGs interpolation results was below 10%. At the annual scale, the average SWA and number of lakes over 1 ha showed significant upward trends of 4.4 km2 yr-1 and 7.53 yr-1, respectively. The monthly WBA increased in summer and autumn while decreased in spring and winter. The maximum freezing and thawing ratios were 53.74% in December and 37.32% in May, respectively.

Despite these risks, physical inactivity level remains high especially in higher income countries. The prevalence of physical inactivity among women in Malaysia aged 16 years was 28.2% in 2019 exceeding men by 6.1%. However, little is known regarding the subpopulation of pregnant women especially in Kuala Lumpur which is the most urbanized and highly populated city in Malaysia. Therefore, the aim of this study is to measure the physical inactivity prevalence among first trimester pregnant women in Kuala Lumpur and to identify its determining factors. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 339 first trimester pregnant women were sampled from 13 maternal and child health clinics located in all four parliament districts of Kuala Lumpur. Self-administered questionnaires which contained the Malay version of the pregnancy physical activity questionnaire (PPAQ) were used. Descriptive analysis was conducted to determine the physical inactivity prevalence followed by simple and multiple logistic regression to identify the determinants of physical inactivity with significant level of 5%. RESULTS: The prevalence of physical inactivity was 38.3%. The highest activity was seen in the household activity domain, despite only 24.8% of the respondents were housewives/unemployed. There was little to no participation observed in the vigorous intensity category. The determinants of physical inactivity were primigravida (aOR 3.54 95% CI 1.40, 8.97), education level (aOR 3.77 95% CI 1.35, 10.52) and body mass index (aOR 0.88 95% CI 0.80, 0.97) which explained 22.6% variation of physical inactivity in the final adjusted model. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of physical inactivity among first trimester pregnant mothers in this study was 38.3%, and the highest activity was seen in the household category. Health education on physical activity in pregnancy should be focused on those who are primigravida and have no tertiary education. The educational content should be updated and tailored to current pandemic situation where self-isolation is the new norm, by advocating for home-based, moderate to vigorous intensity physical activities.","output":"Physical inactivity in early pregnancy and the determinants in an urban city setting of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has perpetrated a significant mental health burden amongst health care workers (HCWs) and their families. Families of HCWs are at significant risk of various mental health problems due to concerns regarding the wellbeing of the HCW, fear of contacting the virus from HCWs, staying isolated during periods of quarantine and being the passive recipient of public stigma directed towards HCWs. The objective of this study was to assess the perceived stress, resilience and coping tendencies of families of HCWs managing the COVID 19 crisis. Method: A cross sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in India, where close relatives of 150 HCWs managing COVID-19 patients (directly or indirectly involved in patient care) were selected using systematic random sampling. They were evaluated using the Perceived Stress Scale, Brief Resilience Coping Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Pearson's correlation and Independent t-test were used for statistical analysis using the SPSS software. Results: Majority (75%) of the family members associated with frontline HCWs had moderate to high level of perceived stress, while23% and 17% had clinically significant anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. More than 50% had low resilience and coping scores. High levels of stress, anxiety and depression were seen in female respondents, those less than 40 years old, having a child or an elderly family member and when the HCW had direct involvement in COVID- 19 patient care. Conclusion: Families of HCWs suffer from significant psychological burden due to the COVID-19 crisis. They face significant risk of depression and anxiety associated problems, which are augmented by low resilience and impaired coping. Mental health of HCWs and their family members should be given due attention with a focus on early identification, providing psychological support and improving resilience.

OBJECTIVES This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the scientific summary of initial Fio2 in preterm newborns (<35 weeks' gestation) who receive respiratory support at birth. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched between January 1, 1980 and August 10, 2018. STUDY SELECTION Studies were selected by pairs of independent reviewers in 2 stages with a Cohen's  of 0.8 and 1.0. DATA EXTRACTION Pairs of independent reviewers extracted data, appraised the risk of bias (RoB), and assessed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty. RESULTS Ten randomized controlled studies and 4 cohort studies included 5697 patients. There are no statistically significant benefits of or harms from starting with lower compared with higher Fio2 in short-term mortality (n = 968; risk ratio = 0.83 [95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.37]), long-term mortality, neurodevelopmental impairment, or other key preterm morbidities. A sensitivity analysis in which 1 study with a high RoB was excluded failed to reveal a reduction in mortality with initial low Fio2 (n = 681; risk ratio = 0.63 [95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.03]). LIMITATIONS The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes due to RoB, inconsistency, and imprecision.

Four different locations (facepiece and strap) on 5 different N95 FFR models (3M 1860, 8210, 8511, 9211; Moldex 1511) were inoculated with a 10 L drop of SARS-CoV-2 viral stock (8 x 107 TCID50/mL). The outside-facing and wearer-facing surfaces of the respirators were each irradiated with a dose of 1.5 J/cm2 UVC (254 nm).

UVC delivered using a dose of 1.5 J/cm2, to each side, was an effective method of decontamination for the facepieces of 3M 1860 and Moldex 1511, and for the straps of 3M 8210 and the Moldex 1511. This dose is an appropriate decontamination method to facilitate reuse of respirators for healthcare personnel when applied to certain models/materials. Increasing the dose may improve decontamination for the other models and straps; however, UVC radiation can degrade certain polymers in a dose dependent manner, and the effects may vary greatly between different models.

Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, we analyzed data of 4,867 adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017C2018. Linear regression models were employed to identify possible correlations between sTfR and other characteristics. The association between sTfR and CVDs was assessed with univariable and multivariable logistics regression models. Results: The prevalence of CVDs was 9.5% among participants, and higher sTfR levels were found in participants with CVDs (p < 0.001). Linear regression models revealed positive associations between sTfR and age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, glycated hemoglobulin A1c, and insulin resistance (all p < 0.001).

Presently, pharmacological research reports are available on only few species namely Bituminaria bituminosa (Syn: P. bituminosa), P. canescens, P. corylifolia, P. esculenta, P. plicata and P. glandulosa which are valued for their chemical constituents and traditional uses. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review article provides explicit information on traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities of selected Psoralea species. The possible trends and perspectives for future research on these plants are also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive and systematic review of the extant literature was carried out, and the data under various sections were identified using a computerized bibliographic search via the PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE, EMBASE, INMEDPLAN, NATTS as well as several websites. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 291 bioactive compounds from 06 species of genus Psoralea have been isolated and characterized. However, P. bituminosa alone possess nearly 150 compounds. These bioactive compounds belong to different chemical classes, including flavonoids, coumarins, furanocoumarins, chalcones, quinines, terpenoids and some others due to which these species exhibit significant anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-helmintic, anti-diabetic, diuretic, hepatoprotective, anti-cancer and anti-tumor activities.

Methods In this observational study of the cases reported by Public Health England for confirmed (sequencing and genotyping), SARS-CoV2 cases Delta variant (n=592,692) and Alpha variant (n=150,934) were used. Outcomes were analyzed by age groups and compared with all reported weekly cases in the UK. Results The Delta variant surge is associated with a significantly lower case fatality rate (0.43% vs 1.07; RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.37-0.42; P<0.0001); lower odds of hospitalization (2.1% vs 3.0%; RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.68-0.73; P<0.0001) than the Alpha variant.

METHOD: Ecological study based on population and death data for the months of March 2016 to 2020 in Castilla y Len. The general and provincial standardized rates, the relative risks of the year 2020 with respect to previous years and the risks adjusted by sex, periods and province, using Poisson regression, were calculated. Trend analysis was performed using joinpoint linear regression. RESULTS: An increase in mortality was observed in March 2020 with respect to previous years, with an increase of 39% for men (relative risk [RR]: 1.39; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.32-1.47) and 28% for women (RR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.21-1.35). The model predicts excess mortality of 775 deaths. In the trend analysis there is a significant turning point in 2019 in men, globally and for almost all provinces. The increase in mortality is general, although heterogeneous by sex, age group and province.

In this study, we aimed to design and construct a bivalent protein consisting of GRFT and EK1 components and evaluate its inhibitory activity and mechanism of action against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants, as well as other human coronaviruses (HCoVs). METHODS: The bivalent proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified with Ni-NTA column. HIV backbone-based pseudovirus (PsV) infection and HCoV S-mediated cellCcell fusion assays were performed to test their inhibitory activity. ELISA and Native-PAGE were conducted to illustrate the mechanism of action of these bivalent proteins. Five-day-old newborn mice were intranasally administrated with a selected bivalent protein before or after HCoV-OC43 challenge, and its protective effect was monitored for 14 days. RESULTS: Among the three bivalent proteins purified, GL25E exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against infection of SARS-CoV-2 PsVs expressing wild-type and mutated S protein. GL25E was significantly more effective than GRFT and EK1 alone in inhibiting HCoV S-mediated cellCcell fusion, as well as infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43. GL25E could inhibit authentic SASR-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E infection in vitro and prevent newborn mice from authentic HCoV-OC43 infection in vivo. GL25E could bind to glycans in the S1 subunit and HR1 in the S2 subunit in S protein, showing a mechanism of action similar to that of GRFT and EK1 alone. CONCLUSIONS: Since GL25E showed highly potent and broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants, as well as other HCoVs, it is a promising candidate for further development as a broad-spectrum anti-HCoV therapeutic and prophylactic to treat and prevent COVID-19 and other emerging HCoV diseases.","output":"A bivalent protein targeting glycans and HR1 domain in spike protein potently inhibited infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we discuss methods for determining delay distributions in modern Very Large Scale Integration design.

We conducted this study to share our experience using ECMO as a bridge to recovery for ARDS due to COVID-19. METHODS: All adult patients who were placed on ECMO for ARDS due to COVID-19 between April 2020 and June 2020 (during the first wave of COVID-19) were identified. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients were analyzed with a specific focus on the differences between patients who survived to hospital discharge and those who did not. RESULTS: In total, 20 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. All patients were placed on veno-veno ECMO. Comparing survivors and non-survivors, older age was found to be associated with hospital mortality (p = .02). The following complications were observed: renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (35%, n = 7), bacteremia during ECMO (20%, n = 4), coinfection with bacterial pneumonia (15%, n = 3), cannula site bleeding (15%, n = 3), stroke (10%, n = 2), gastrointestinal bleeding (10%, n = 2), and liver failure (5%, n = 1). The complications associated with patient mortality were culture-positive septic shock (p = .01), culture-negative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (p = .01), and renal failure (p = .01). The causes of death were septic shock (44%, n = 4), culture-negative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (44%, n = 4), and stroke (11%, n = 1).

In this context, the question therefore arises: how can competition policy and competition authorities contribute to a faster and more sustained economic recovery? The paper concludes that competition policy and competition authorities have a very relevant role to play to ensure a robust economic bounce-back and recovery in the long-term. Competition advocacy by competition authorities can be expected to play a more relevant role in the near future, helping policy makers make full and well-informed policy choices, accounting for competition distortions from state interventions, and designing support measures.

We reviewed the clinical course, key laboratory data including acute-phase reactants, and drug/medication history in 2 elderly male patients admitted for COVID-19 respiratory failure. Both patients had a complicated clinical course and suffered from hematochezia, acute blood loss, and anemia which led to hemodynamic instability requiring blood transfusion around day 40 of their hospitalization. Colonoscopic impressions were correlated with the histopathological findings in the colonic biopsies that included changes compatible with ischemia and nonspecific acute inflammation, edema, and increased eosinophils in the lamina propria. Both patients were hemodynamically stable, on prophylactic anticoagulants, multiple antibiotics, and antifungal agents due to respiratory infections at the time of lower GI bleeding. Hematochezia resolved spontaneously with supportive care. Both patients eventually recovered and were discharged. Elderly patients with significant comorbid conditions are uniquely at risk for ischemic injury to the bowel. This case report highlights hematochezia as an uncommon GI manifestation of spectrum of COVID-19 complications. The causes of bleeding in these COVID-19 associated cases are likely multifactorial and can be attributed to concomitant etiologies based on their age, multiple comorbid conditions, prolonged hospitalization compounded by lung injury, and hypoxia precipitated by the virus. We hypothesize that rather than a direct viral cytopathic effect, ischemia and hypoperfusion may be unleashed due to the cytokine storm orchestrated by the virus that leads to abnormal coagulation profile. Additional factors that may contribute to ischemic injury are prophylactic use of anticoagulants and polypharmacy. There were no other causes to explain the brisk lower GI bleeding. Presentation of hematochezia was followed by hemodynamic instability that may further increase the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 patients, and prompt consultation and management by gastroenterology is therefore warranted.","output":"Clinical and Intestinal Histopathological Findings in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Patients with Hematochezia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Between January 24, 2020 and February 15, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred among 335 passengers on a flight from Singapore to Hangzhou in China.

Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, residents perceived that time spent on organized didactics/conferences decreased and that attending physicians are less involved in education. Furthermore, the majority of residents felt that the quality of didactic education diminished as a result of the pandemic. Surprisingly, while many residents expressed concerns about being prepared to become an attending, few were concerned about completing graduation requirements or needing an extra year of education. In light of these findings, it is critical to devote attention to the effects of the pandemic on residents' professional trajectories and create innovative opportunities for improving education during this challenging time.","output":"Has COVID-19 Hurt Resident Education?

It primarily targets the lungs, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, it may also lead to multiple organ failure (MOF) and enhanced mortality rates. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop potential effective therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from various types of cells that participate in intercellular communication to maintain physiological and pathological processes. EVs derived from various cellular origins have revealed suppressive effects on the cytokine storm during systemic hyper-inflammatory states of severe COVID-19, leading to enhanced alveolar fluid clearance, promoted epithelial and endothelial recovery, and cell proliferation. Being the smallest subclass of EVs, exosomes offer striking characteristics such as cell targeting, being nano-carriers for drug delivery, high biocompatibility, safety, and low-immunogenicity, thus rendering them a potential cell-free therapeutic candidate against the pathogeneses of various diseases. Due to these properties, numerous studies and clinical trials have been performed to assess their safety and therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19. Hence, in this review, we have comprehensively described current updates on progress and challenges for EVs as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of COVID-19.","output":"Extracellular Vesicle-Based Therapy for COVID-19: Promises, Challenges and Future Prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The delivery of endoscopic care is changing rapidly in the era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The assay involves simple equipment and techniques and low cost, without the need for expensive qPCR machines, and the result, indicated by color change, is easily interpreted by naked eyes. COVID-19-LAMP can detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA with detection limit of 42 copies/reaction. Of 223 respiratory samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR, 212 and 219 were positive by COVID-19-LAMP at 60 and 90 min (sensitivities of 95.07% and 98.21%) respectively, with the highest sensitivities among nasopharyngeal swabs (96.88% and 98.96%), compared to sputum/deep throat saliva samples (94.03% and 97.02%), and throat swab samples (93.33% and 98.33%). None of the 143 samples with other respiratory viruses were positive by COVID-19-LAMP, showing 100% specificity. Samples with higher viral load showed shorter detection time, some as early as 30 min.

Although the epidemic hit different regions with different intensities, our model shows that, for regions where the incidence profile is similar to the cities analysed, the risk of reopening of schools is still too high. This in spite of the fact that incidences in these cities were declining in the period of the time considered. Therefore, although we cannot extend the result to the entire country, the overall conclusion is valid for regions with a declining incidence and it is even more valid for regions where incidence is increasing. We assumed a very conservative level of infection transmissibility of children of just 10% as that of adults. In spite of the very low level of transmissibility is assumed, the number of secondary cases caused by infected children among teachers, school staff and relatives varied from 2 to 85. It is, therefore, too soon to have any degree of confidence that reopening of schools before the advent of a vaccine is the right decision to take.

The FRAIL scale was used to evaluate the frailty of patients. Patients with CSVD with frailty and MMSE score <27 were considered to have cognitive frailty. Patients with non-cognitive frailty were included in the control group. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to evaluate the cognitive function of patients with CSVD. The serum interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) of patients with CSVD were detected. The correlation between blood inflammatory factors and oxidative stress factors with the frailty and cognitive frailty patients of CSVD were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation between cognitive frailty and CSVD. Results: Among the patients with CSVD selected in this study, female patients and older patients had a higher proportion of frailty (p < 0.001). In the Frail group, MoCA score and MMSE score were significantly lower than in the Pre-Frail and Robust groups, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) scores were significantly higher than the Pre-Frail and Robust groups, and the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Notoriously, technologies with a significant environmental footprint or high social cost persist despite the successful development of more environmentally friendly and/or socially efficient alternatives. The displacement of the status quo is hindered by entrenched economic interests and network effects. To exacerbate matters, the standard mechanism design approaches based on centralized authorities with the capacity to use preferential subsidies to effectively dictate system outcomes are not always applicable to modern decentralized economies. What other types of mechanisms are feasible? In this paper, we develop and analyze a mechanism that induces transitions from inefficient lock-ins to superior alternatives. This mechanism does not exogenously favor one option over another -- instead, the phase transition emerges endogenously via a standard evolutionary learning model, Q-learning, where agents trade-off exploration and exploitation. Exerting the same transient influence to both the efficient and inefficient technologies encourages exploration and results in irreversible phase transitions and permanent stabilization of the efficient one. On a technical level, our work is based on bifurcation and catastrophe theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with changes in the number and stability properties of equilibria.

In response, many countries have implemented non pharmaceutical methods of intervention, such as social distancing and lockdowns. This study aims to investigate the relationship of four dimensions of social capital (community attachment, social trust, family bond, and security) and several control variables with COVID-19 deaths. METHODS: We retrieved data from open access databases and a survey. COVID-19 death-related data were collected from the website Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. Social capital-related data were collected from a large-scale survey that included web-based and face-to-face surveys covering 100,956 respondents across all regions/provinces/states of 37 countries in 2017. Data regarding population density, number of hospital beds, and population aged 65 or older were retrieved from the World Development Indicators (WDIs). Data on country lockdowns were obtained from the website National responses to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. Linear regressions were applied to identify the relationship between social capital and COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 deaths were associated with social capital both positively and negatively. Community attachment and social trust were associated with more COVID-19 deaths, and family bond and security were associated with fewer deaths. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with population density, ageing population, and interactions between four dimensions of social capital-related factors and the ageing population. Furthermore, the number of hospital beds and early lockdown policy were negatively associated with COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the role of social capital in dynamically evolving threats, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, is not always negative or positive. Therefore, peoples behaviour should be changed to support countries response to the COVID-19 threat.

We consider how theoretical elements of Co-Creation can inform effective international public health interventions; crucial during a global pandemic in which handwashing is the most effective method to control the transmission of COVID-19. Finally we reflect on some of the methodological challenges of our own work and in managing the potentially conflicting goals of the ethical and participatory values of Co-Creation with pragmatic considerations about ensuring an effective final 'product'.","output":"Evaluating approaches to designing effective Co-Created hand-hygiene interventions for children in India, Sierra Leone and the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since late 2010, outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have been reported in the swine industry in China. A variant PEDV strain that differs from strain CV777 causes prevalent PEDV infections which commercial vaccines based on CV777 cannot provide complete protection. In this study, we designed a new vaccine based on the epidemic PEDV strain AH2012/12, adjuvanted with flagellin, a mucosal adjuvant that induces mucosal and systemic production of IgA. Three groups of pregnant sows were immunized twice, with a 14-day interval, with PEDV adjuvanted with flagellin, PEDV alone, or PBS before farrowing, and newborn piglets from each group were selected and challenged with PEDV. Immunization with this vaccine elicited high levels of IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies in the serum and colostrum of sows, and newborn piglets were protected against PEDV while suckling. This study should guide the prevention and control strategies for PEDV infection, thereby reducing the losses associated with this virus.","output":"A flagellin-adjuvanted inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) vaccine provides enhanced immune protection against PEDV challenge in piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We observed patients to have variable temperatures. The objective of the study was to identify if hypothermia in a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a higher than expected mortality. METHODS: We reviewed 331 charts from patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 between March 9 to April 20, 2020. RESULTS: The probability of death was 2.06 times higher for those with hypothermia than those without [95% C.I. (1.25, 3.38)]. In ventilated patients, there were 32 deaths. Of those, 75% had been hypothermic. In a prior review of 10,000 non-SARS-CoV-2 patients with sepsis, the mortality rate in patients with hypothermia was 47%. Reviewed studies demonstrated a range of expected mortality rates in patients with ventilator dependent respiratory failure and sepsis. In comparison, our study shows that within a group of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 and hypothermia, the mortality rate exceeded those rates. CONCLUSION: Our review showed a significant association between hypothermia and death (p = 0.0033). Predictors of mortality in SARS-CoV-2 disease can expedite earlier aggressive care. Additionally, in areas with limited resources or overburdened healthcare systems, there may be a need for resource allocation management and information about mortality risk may be helpful.","output":"Association of Hypothermia with Increased Mortality Rate in SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Regardless of the improvement in key recommendations in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), the prevalence of total occlusion (TO) of infarct-related artery (IRA), and the impact of TO of IRA on outcomes in patients with NSTEMI, remain unclear. Aim: The study aimed to assess the incidence and predictors of TO of IRA in patients with NSTEMI, and its clinical significance. Material and Methods: The study was a single-center retrospective cohort analysis of 399 consecutive patients with NSTEMI (293 male, mean age: 71  10.1 years) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The study population was categorized into patients with TO and non-TO of IRA on coronary angiography. In-hospital and one-year mortality were analyzed. Results: TO of IRA in the NSTEMI population occurred in 138 (34.6%) patients. Multivariate analysis identified the following independent predictors of TO of IRA: left ventricular ejection fraction (odds ratio (OR) 0.949, p < 0.001); family history of coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 2.652, p < 0.001); and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level (OR 0.972, p = 0.002). In-hospital and one-year mortality were significantly higher in the TO group than the non-TO group (2.8% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.007 and 18.1% vs. 6.5%, p < 0.001, respectively). The independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at admission (OR 0.768, p = 0.004); and TO of IRA (OR 1.863, p = 0.005). Conclusions: In the population of patients with NSTEMI, TO of IRA represents a considerably frequent phenomenon, and corresponds with impaired outcomes. Therefore, the utmost caution should be paid to prevent delay of coronary angiography in NSTEMI patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function, metabolic disturbances, and a family history of CAD, who are at increased risk of TO of IRA.","output":"Total Occlusion of the Infarct-Related Artery in Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)How Can We Identify These Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The childhood obesity epidemic has persisted for over three decades, which has presented serious social, economic and health consequences worldwide. For researchers and policy makers alike, cycling has been a promising focus over recent years for developing long-term physically active lifestyles in urban environments, in addition to contributing to the global quest to combat climate change. Promoting cycling thus presents a win-win situation not just for individuals' well-being, but for multiple involved sectors such as public health, transport ministry and environmental agencies. For children, cycling promotes exercise engagement, active transport opportunities, motor skill development and social interaction. However, across European cities, there are considerable discrepancies in the uptake of cycling amongst children. To understand and subsequently promote children's cycling behavior, it is crucial that the complex social, physical and policy environment, and their interrelationships, are considered. Therefore, in this perspective article, we adopt the socio-ecological model to gain insight into how children's cycling behavior is shaped at the interpersonal, organizational and community level embedded within city policies, relevant to increase future cycling participation in children. Our perspective is based on a review of cycling policies of two European cities, Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Newcastle (UK), where stark contrasts in children's cycling participation can be observed. Our findings show that cycling policies in Amsterdam have mainly contributed to comprehensive organizational level changes, for example, cycling infrastructure development within the city, whereby these initiatives have made significant progress at the community level where cycling has become part of the Dutch culture. Hence, cycling is a more common transportation mode among children in Amsterdam than in Newcastle. In Newcastle, policies primarily focus on organizational or community level changes, and progress has recently been accelerated in response to COVID-19. In addition to differences, we have also identified similar challenges in the two cities, such as the urgency to support uptake of cycling for children with low socio-economic background or challenges related to cultural differences. We also propose a shared (cycle-)path for policy makers and researchers as working together is crucial in producing multi-component interventions at a policy level that recognize individual, as well as interpersonal, community and organizational factors.","output":"A Tale of Two Cities: Understanding Children's Cycling Behavior From the Socio-Ecological Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Probiotics have growth promoting effects even under periods of heat stress challenge. More information is needed to understand the mechanisms by which probiotics maintain the growth performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a probiotic based on Bacillus subtilis bacteria on growth related mechanisms of broilers under heat stress conditions. Specifically, growth performance, skeletal bone characteristics, skeletal muscles size, intestinal villus-crypt structure, intestinal bacteria, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cholesterol, and glucose. A total of 1200 one day old Ross 308 male broilers were randomly distributed into 4 treatments, with 12 replicates per treatment and 25 birds per replicate. A 2  2 factorial arrangement was used; the main factors were environmental temperature (thermoneutral or heat stress) and diet (control or control + B. subtilis; 3  107 cfu/kg of feed). From d 22 to 35 of age, birds were either exposed to thermoneutral conditions (21 C) or chronic heat stress (30 C). During the same period, each group was divided into 2 subgroups and fed either the control diet or the B. subtilis supplemented diet. The results demonstrated that B. subtilis had positive effects (P < 0.05) on the body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, villus height, crypt depth, villus surface area, absorptive epithelial cell area and viable counts of intestinal beneficial bacteria. B. subtilis increased (P < 0.05) serum GH, IGF-1 and maintain normal levels of cholesterol and glucose under heat stress conditions. In addition, broilers fed B. subtilis under heat stress conditions exhibited higher (P < 0.05) skeletal muscles size and improved (P < 0.05) tibia traits and lower (P < 0.05) abdominal fat pads deposition compared with the controls. B. subtilis had no effect on rectal temperature under thermoneutral or heat stress conditions.

However, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, a high number of cases with a prolonged late-stage stimulation of cytokine production that leads to a cytokine storm phenotype, an undesirable, dangerous immune-related state that can cause multiple organ failures, have been reported. To treat this, immunosuppressants with selective action on the innate NF-kB pathway are urgently required. Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) has been reported to yield antiinflammatory activity, thus might be a potential candidate for such effort. In this study, we carried out experimental procedures on the PGRP-LB mutant line of Drosophila melanogaster to examine the immunosuppressive effect of Momordica charantia L. fruit extract (MCFE) on the NF-kB pathway. Initial phytochemical screening revealed that Momordica charantia L. fruit extract contains alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and saponins. Furthermore, the phenotypical analysis demonstrated that MCFE could improve the survival and locomotor of the PGRP-LB mutant line of Drosophila melanogaster in a concentration-dependent manner. Additional gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of dpt and dro, two important downstream genes in the Imd (NF-kB) pathway of D. melanogaster, was significantly reduced, in a different expression profile, in response to MCFE treatment. However, it is important to note that while the expression of dpt was dramatically repressed in all extract-treated groups, the expression of dro occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. These results strongly support the notion that Momordica charantia L. can reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines downstream of the NF-kB pathway, hence potential to be used as a source candidate to harvest prospective immunosuppressive compounds to alleviate the cytokine storm condition. ? 2021 by the authors.","output":"Imunosuppresive activity of momordica charantia l.

METHODS A one day IPE intervention, 'Evening On-Call' was run involving nursing and medical students and pre-registration pharmacists (student pharmacists in year 5 of training) in an on-call setting. This IPE incorporated manikin and actor patients in a simulated ward. During the intervention, the 3 groups of students are assessed under observation on their clinical, prioritisation and communication skills. Participants perceptions of this intervention were evaluated by completion of a questionnaire to capture their perceptions regarding the experience, the pre-IPL briefing and post-IPL feedback and perceived relevance of this training. Free text sections collected additional comments and a follow-up questionnaire was sent six months later. RESULTS Initial questionnaire feedback was predominantly positive for each professional group. The majority perceived the simulated IPL had given them a greater understanding of other professionals' roles, had enhanced their professional confidence and would help them prioritise workload once qualified. The 6 months follow up questionnaire supported the initial questionnaire findings. Some responses highlighted participants believed the simulated IPL had helped them work more effectively with other healthcare professionals, communicate more effectively and better prioritise their workload.

Engagement of BIPOC communities in infectious disease research is a critical component in efforts to increase vaccine confidence, acceptability, and uptake of future approved products. Recent data highlight the relative absence of BIPOC communities in vaccine clinical trials. Intentional and effective community engagement methods are needed to improve BIPOC inclusion. We describe the methods utilized for the successful enrollment of BIPOC participants in the U.S. Government (USG)-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN)-sponsored vaccine efficacy trials and analyze the demographic and enrollment data across the efficacy trials to inform future efforts to ensure inclusive participation. Across the four USG-funded COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials for which data are available, 47% of participants enrolled at CoVPN sites in the US were BIPOC. White enrollment outpaced enrollment of BIPOC participants throughout the accrual period, requiring the implementation of strategies to increase diverse and inclusive enrollment. Trials opening later benefitted considerably from strengthened community engagement efforts, and greater and more diverse volunteer registry records. Despite robust fiscal resources and a longstanding collaborative and collective effort, enrollment of White persons outpaced that of BIPOC communities. With appropriate resources, commitment and community engagement expertise, the equitable enrollment of BIPOC individuals can be achieved. To ensure this goal, intentional efforts are needed, including an emphasis on diversity of enrollment in clinical trials, establishment of enrollment goals, ongoing robust community engagement, conducting population-specific trials, and research to inform best practices.","output":"Increasing Black, Indigenous and People of Color participation in clinical trials through community engagement and recruitment goal establishment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cadmium (Cd) presents severe risks to human health and environments. The present study proposed a green option to reduce bioavailable Cd. Rice pot experiments were conducted under continuous flooding with three treatments (T1: intercropping azolla with rice; T2: incorporating azolla into soil before rice transplantation; CK: no azolla). The results showed that azolla incorporation reduced soluble Cd by 37% compared with the CK treatment, which may be explained by the decreased soil redox potential (Eh) (r = 0.867, P < 0.01). The higher relative abundance of Methylobacter observed in azolla incorporation treatment may account for dissolved organic carbon increase (r = 0.694; P < 0.05), and hence decreased the Cd availability for rice. Azolla incorporation increased the abundance of Nitrospira, indicating the potentially prominent role of nitrogen mineralization in increasing rice yields. Further, lower soluble Cd decreased the expression of OsNramp5, but increased OsHMA3 levels in rice roots, which decreased Cd accumulation in grains. Through these effects, azolla incorporation decreased Cd concentrations in rice grains by 80.3% and increased the production by 13.4%. The negligible amount of Cd absorbed by azolla would not increase the risk of long-term application. Thus, intercropping azolla with early rice and incorporating azolla into soil before late rice transplantation can contribute to safe production at large scales of double rice cultivation.","output":"Azolla incorporation under flooding reduces grain cadmium accumulation by decreasing soil redox potential."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAs \\"stay at home\\" orders were in effect, many US food workers attended in-person work during early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, charged with maintaining normal operation of the national food supply chain. Despite establishment of a novel national paid sick leave policy, anecdotal evidence suggests that many U.S. food system workers encountered barriers to staying home when ill. MethodsUsing quantitative and free-text analyses from a national, cross-sectional, online survey deployed from July to October 2020 among 2,535 respondents, we explored workplace and non-workplace factors associated with U.S. food system workers intentions to attend work while ill (i.e. presenteeism intentions) during the first four to six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. ResultsOverall, 8.8% of workers surveyed reported intentions to attend work while ill. Both quantitative data and free-text responses suggest that aspects of workplace culture influenced workers decisions to attend work while ill. Workers reporting a high workplace safety climate score had half the odds of reporting presenteeism intentions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37, 0.75) relative to those reporting low scores. Workers described cultural barriers, including retaliation and penalties, that reduced paid sick leave access. Workers reporting low (aOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.35, 3.13) or very low (aOR 2.31, 95% CI 1.50, 3.13) levels of household food security had more than twice the odds of reporting presenteeism intentions. ConclusionsThis study offers insights into opportunities for reducing presenteeism related to illness among food workers both during the COVID-19 pandemic and in other infectious disease scenarios.

METHODS: Analysis of procedures in dealing with a residential unit affected by SARS-CoV?2, accommodating a risk group of 60 seniors with dementia is presented as well as a detailed presentation of post-mortem examination results of all 8 deceased tested positive for SARS-CoV?2. RESULTS: Out of 60 residents, 39 were infected by SARS-CoV?2. Due to preventive procedures it was possible to stop further spreading of the infection to other residential areas. In all 8 fatal cases, the autopsy diagnosis was death due to COVID-19. Autopsies revealed all COVID-19 patients to have a fatal (broncho)pneumonia and signs of relevant pre-existing cardiac, renal and pulmonary conditions in all cases. In 75% (n = 6) of the cases a fresh venous thrombosis was found. In 66.7% (n = 4) of the cases thrombotic events were combined with peripheral pulmonary artery thromboembolisms.

Potential benefits include increased patient engagement, improved clinical outcomes, and reduced health care costs. However, mHealth is often studied in projects or trials, and structural implantation in clinical practice is less common. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to outline the design of the Box and its implementation and use in an outpatient clinic setting. The impact on logistical outcomes and patient and provider satisfaction is discussed. METHODS: In 2016, an mHealth care track including smartphone-compatible devices, named the Box, was implemented in the cardiology department of a tertiary medical center in the Netherlands. Patients with myocardial infarction, rhythm disorders, cardiac surgery, heart failure, and congenital heart disease received devices to measure daily weight, blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. In addition, professional and patient user comments on the experience with the care track were obtained via structured interviews. RESULTS: From 2016 to April 2020, a total of 1140 patients were connected to the mHealth care track. On average, a Box cost 350 (US $375), not including extra staff costs. The median patient age was 60.8 (IQR 52.9-69.3) years, and 73.59% (839/1140) were male. A median of 260 (IQR 105-641) measurements was taken on a median of 189 (IQR 98-372) days. Patients praised the ease of use of the devices and felt more involved with their illness and care. Professionals reported more productive outpatient consultations as well as improved insight into health parameters such as blood pressure and weight. A feedback loop from the hospital to patient to focus on measurements was commented as an important improvement by both patients and professionals. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the design and implementation of an mHealth care track for outpatient follow-up of patients with various cardiovascular diseases is described. Data from these 4 years indicate that mHealth is feasible to incorporate in outpatient management and is generally well-accepted by patients and providers. Limitations include the need for manual measurement data checks and the risk of data overload. Moreover, the tertiary care setting in which the Box was introduced may limit the external validity of logistical and financial end points to other medical centers.

Its deficiency causes osteomalacia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and an increased risk for fractures and falls. However, clinical and experimental evidence points to extra-skeletal actions of vitamin D, including on immune and respiratory systems. Thus, during this COVID-19 pandemic, a possible deleterious role of vitamin D deficiency has been questioned. This paper aims to present a brief review of the literature and discuss, based on evidence, the role of vitamin D in the lung function and in the prevention of respiratory infections. Relevant articles were searched in the databases MEDLINE/PubMed and SciELO/LILACS. The mechanisms of vitamin D action in the immune system response will be discussed. Clinical data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses show benefits in the prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function when vitamin D-deficient patients are supplemented. At the time of writing this paper, no published data on vitamin D supplementation for patients with COVID-19 have been found. Vitamin D supplementation is recommended during this period of social isolation to avoid any deficiency, especially in the context of bone outcomes, aiming to achieve normal values of 25(OH)D. The prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function are additional benefits observed when vitamin D deficiency is treated. Thus far, any protective effect of vitamin D specifically against severe COVID-19 remains unclear. We also emphasize avoiding bolus or extremely high doses of vitamin D, which can increase the risk of intoxication without evidence of benefits.","output":"Reasons to avoid vitamin D deficiency during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance was one of the top priorities for global public health before the start of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the phantom experiment, seven robot-assisted punctures were made to evaluate the accuracy of the method. In the animal experiment, 18 punctures (nine robotic and nine manual) were made in the livers of nine rabbits. The indicators, such as needle-tract length, angle deviation, puncture accuracy, number of scans required, and radiation exposure dose were compared between manual and robotic punctures. The paired-samples t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS: In the phantom experiment, the mean accuracy of seven punctures was 2.67 mm. In the animal experiment, there was no significant difference in needle-tract length (32.58 mm vs. 34.04 mm, p = .606), angle deviation (17.21 vs. 21.23 p = .557) and puncture accuracy (8.42 vs. 8.77 mm, p = .851) between the two groups. However, the number CT scans required (2.44 vs. 3.33, p = .002), and the radiation exposure dose (772.98 vs. 1077.89 mGy/cm, p = .003) were lower in the robot group than in the manual group. CONCLUSIONS: The coordinate positioning puncture method under robot-assisted CT-guidance can reach an accuracy that is comparable to that of the traditional manual CT-guided puncture method and with fewer CT scanning times accompanied with a lower radiation dosage.","output":"A coordinate positioning puncture method under robot-assisted CT-guidance: phantom and animal experiments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is often difficult for a physician to distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of respiratory infections and this may result in overuse of antibiotics. In many cases of community-acquired respiratory infections, clinicians treat patients empirically. The development of molecular methods for direct detection of viruses has been progressed recently. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was recognizing the panel of respiratory RNA viruses by multiplex SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized 172 influenza-negative respiratory specimens of all age groups of hospitalized patients were collected. After RNA extraction, cDNA was synthesized. Three SYBR Green multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed for simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory RNA viruses. Each set of multiplex methods detected four viruses, the first set: respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus; the second set: parainfluenza viruses 1 - 4 (PIV1-4); the third set: coronaviruses NL63, 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and OC43. RESULTS: Application of the multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR in clinical samples from 172 patients in a one-year study resulted in detection of 19 (11.04%) PIV3, 9 (5.23%) PIV4, and 1 (0.58%) coronavirus NL63.

Visual examination of the world map shows a wide variation of death tolls between countries. The main goal of our series is to determine the best predictors of such discrepancy. Methods: This is a retrospective study in which the rate of COVID-19 deaths was correlated with each of the following independent variables: total tests per 1 million population, gross domestic product (GDP), average temperatures per country, ultraviolet index, median age, average BMI per country, food supply, Bacille Calmette-Guerin compulsory status, and passenger traffic. Results: BMI per country proved to be the second best predictor of death rate with an R value of 0.43, and GDP being the best predictor with R = 0.65. Conclusion: This article shows a tight correlation between average BMI, food supply per country, and COVID-19-related deaths. Such predisposing factors might operate by upregulating the inflammation pathway in heavily struck countries, leading to easier triggering of the infamous cytokine storm syndrome.

This study explores the impact of SIPOs on health, with particular attention to heterogeneity in their impacts. First, using daily state-level social distancing data from SafeGraph and a difference-in-differences approach, we document that adoption of a SIPO was associated with a 5 to 10 percent increase in the rate at which state residents remained in their homes full-time. Then, using daily state-level coronavirus case data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we find that approximately three weeks following the adoption of a SIPO, cumulative COVID-19 cases fell by 44 percent. Event-study analyses confirm common COVID-19 case trends in the week prior to SIPO adoption and show that SIPO-induced case reductions grew larger over time. However, this average effect masks important heterogeneity across states  early adopters and high population density states appear to reap larger benefits from their SIPOs.

The cytokine storm is a known factor causing major clinical symptoms leading to death in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE To investigate and compare the serum levels of different cytokines in COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity. METHODS Concentrations of serum cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, and GM-CSF, were measured in 61 COVID-19 patients and 31 normal controls with ELISA. We investigated the correlation between the levels of these cytokines and clinical severity, CRP level, neutrophil and lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS Our data indicated that the levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, IFN-, and GM-CSF, but not IL-10 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to normal controls. Statistical analysis showed that the level of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, IFN-, and GM-CSF were higher in severe COVID-19 than those of mild cases. The concentrations of all mentioned cytokines were negatively associated with the absolute count of lymphocytes, and positively correlated with the CRP level and the absolute count of neutrophils.

As a consequence, economic activities within and across the countries were almost halted. As restrictions loosen and cities start to resume public and private transport to revamp the economy, it becomes critical to assess the commuters' travel-related risk in light of the ongoing pandemic. We develop a generalizable quantitative framework to evaluate the commute-related risk arising from inter-district and intra-district travels by combining Nonparametric Data Envelopment analysis for vulnerability assessment with transportation network analysis. We demonstrate the application of the proposed model for establishing travel corridors or travel bubbles within and across Gujarat and Maharashtra, two Indian states that have reported many SARS-CoV2 cases since early April 2020. Our findings suggest that establishing the travel bubble between a pair of districts solely based on the health vulnerability indices of origin-destination discards the en-route travel risks due to prevalent pandemic, hence underestimating the threat. For example, while the resultant of social and health vulnerabilities of Narmada and Vadodara's districts is relatively moderate, the en-route travel risk exacerbates the overall travel risk. Our study provides actionable insights to users into choosing the alternate path with the least risk and can inform political decisions to establish low-risk travel corridors within and across the states while accounting for social and health vulnerabilities in addition to transit-time related risks.","output":"A Quantitative Framework for Establishing Low-risk Interdistrict Travel Corridors during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we examine the effect of an organizations multi-dimensional reputation on the external stakeholders preference for an organization in the notions of reputation incongruence.

Its use can be difficult, posing a high risk of contamination, mainly during doffing, then with the risk of becoming infected. METHODS We conducted a prospective before-and-after design that used clinical simulation as a research methodology in a clinical simulation center of Colombia. A simulation-based educational intervention with two cases related to COVID-19 was proposed in the emergency room and the intensive care unit. We conducted A workshop for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and a debriefing after the first case. RESULTS In the pre-test, 100% of participants failed donning and doffing PPE, 98.4% were contaminated, only one-person did not contaminate out of. The mean cognitive load was high (7.430.9 points). In the post-test, 100% were successful in donning the PPE and 94.8% in doffing; only 9.8% were contaminated. The mean of the cognitive load was low (4.11.4 points), and the performance was high (7.91.1). Of the total, 73.8% of participants reported overload in the doffing. The most difficulties were in gown/overall, and N95 mask removal. DISCUSSION The PPE donning and doffing is critical and may be changed significantly by active training. In responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, activities of training in donning and doffing PPE would provide a means of training personnel, reducing the cognitive load and maybe the risk of contamination and infection of health care workers.","output":"Cognitive load and performance of health care professionals in donning and doffing PPE before and after a simulation-based educational intervention and its implications during the COVID-19 pandemic for biosafety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Norovirus is a major etiologic agent in worldwide outbreaks of gastroenteritis associated with food as well as person\\\\to\\\\person transmission.

The aim of this systematic review is to review the evidence for the prevalence of PTSD in gastrointestinal cohorts versus comparator groups (healthy controls and chronic illness groups), predictive factors associated with the development and management of PTSD and the impact on patient outcomes. Adult studies were identified through systematic searches of eight databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, PsycINFO, Ovid Nursing, CINAHL, Informit Health Collection, and Cochrane Library) in February 2020. The overall pooled prevalence rate of PTSD in GI cohorts was 36%; however, the prevalence rate in non-veteran-specific gastrointestinal cohorts of 18% across all GI classification groups is likely to be the more representative rate. The non-gastrointestinal chronic illness cohort PTSD prevalence rate was 11%. Predictors identified in the development of post-traumatic stress in gastrointestinal cohorts include: female gender, poor social support, life adversity, subjective pain, and dietary choices. Post-traumatic stress was found to exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms in a Crohn's Disease sample, whereby disease exacerbation was four times in those who met the criteria for probable PTSD. Post-traumatic stress symptoms affect around one in five individuals (non-veteran status) with a gastrointestinal condition.

This paper proposes design rules for register shifts in ¦-motifs, which have not been reported previously, but are necessary for determining a target structure of de novo design of -proteins. By analyzing naturally occurring protein structures in a database, we found preferences for register shifts in ¦-motifs, and derived the following empirical rules: (1) register shifts must not be negative regardless of torsion types for a constituent loop in ¦-motifs; (2) preferred register shifts strongly depend on the loop torsion types. To explain these empirical rules by physical interactions, we conducted physics-based simulations for systems mimicking a ¦-motif that contains the most frequently observed loop type in the database. We performed an exhaustive conformational sampling of the loop region, imposing the exclusion volume and hydrogen bond satisfaction condition. The distributions of register shifts obtained from the simulations agreed well with those of the database analysis, indicating that the empirical rules are a consequence of physical interactions, rather than an evolutionary sampling bias.

This nonlinear model for the COVID-19 epidemic includes eight state variables (susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, hospitalized, recovered, deceased, and insusceptible populations). Two plausible scenarios are put forward in this article to control this epidemic before and after its vaccine invention. In the first scenario, the social distancing and hospitalization rates are employed as two applicable control inputs to diminish the exposed and infected groups. However, in the second scenario after the vaccine development, the vaccination rate is taken into account as the third control input to reduce the susceptible populations, in addition to the two objectives of the first scenario. The proposed feedback control measures are defined in terms of the hospitalized and deceased populations due to the available statistical data, while other unmeasurable compartmental variables are estimated by an extended Kalman filter (EKF). In other words, the susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, recovered, and insusceptible individuals cannot be identified precisely because of the asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 in some cases, its incubation period, and the lack of an adequate community screening.

Demographic data were collected (age, sex, federal state, profession). Experience with own COVID-19 infection, or infection in personal environment (family, friends) as well as willingness to vaccinate was queried. Results: The sample includes n = 1296 participants. A willingness to be vaccinated exists in 57%, 27.6% participants were undecided. Our results show a higher propensity to vaccinate among the following groups: male gender, higher medical education level, older age, own burden caused by the pandemic (p &lt;0.001).

Herein, we demonstrated serial LUS changes in a 75-year-old woman recovering from COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in need of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. LUS initially revealed extensive consolidation in the bilateral lower lung (BLL) fields with coalescent B-lines. While the patient recovered from ARDS, the findings gradually changed to discrete B-lines and small pleural consolidations. The LUS findings were more sensitive than those of the CXR in detecting re-expansion of the lungs by showing B-lines instead of consolidations in the BLL fields immediately after recruitment maneuver (RM). Compared with physiological parameters, LUS findings provided more precise information about the parts of the lungs that had been recruited by RM. Therefore, we encourage intensivists to extend their use of LUS in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS to acquire real-time information for a quick response and minimize the risk of viral transmission.","output":"Using lung ultrasound changes to evaluate the response of recruitment maneuver in a patient recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Topical povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is currently being considered as a potential preventive measure against the spread of COVID-19.

Data analysis used global regression models: ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial autoregressive model (SAR), and conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the local regression model called multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR).Findings: The higher the GINI index, the higher the incidence of the disease at the municipal level. Likewise, the higher the nurse ratio per 1,000 inhabitants in the municipalities, the higher the COVID-19 incidence. Meanwhile, the proportional mortality ratio was inversely associated with incidence of the disease.Discussion: Social inequality increased the risk of COVID-19 in the municipalities. Better social development of the municipalities was associated with lower risk of the disease.

To our knowledge, no other systematic review has assessed this broad topic. DESIGN: Systematic review of all studies investigating the use of telemedicine in the provision of gynaecological care and education. The search for eligible studies followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and focused on three online databases: PubMed, Science Direct and SciFinder. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only studies within gynaecology were considered for this review. Studies covering only obstetrics and with minimal information on gynaecology, or clinical medicine in general were excluded. All English language, peer-reviewed human studies were included. Relevant studies published up to the date of final submission of this review were considered with no restrictions to the publication year. DATA EXTRACTIONS AND SYNTHESIS: Data extracted included author details, year of publication and country of the study, study aim, sample size, methodology, sample characteristics, outcome measures and a summary of findings. Data extraction and qualitative assessment were performed by the first author and crossed checked by the second author. Quality assessment for each study was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: A literature search carried out in August 2020 yielded 313 records published between 1992 and 2018. Following a rigorous selection process, only 39 studies were included for this review published between 2000 and 2018. Of these, 19 assessed gynaecological clinical practice, eight assessed gynaecological education, one both, and 11 investigated the feasibility of telemedicine within gynaecological practice. 19 studies were classified as good, 12 fair and eight poor using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Telecolposcopy and abortion care were two areas where telemedicine was found to be effective in potentially speeding up diagnosis as well as providing patients with a wide range of management options. Studies focusing on education demonstrated that telementoring could improve teaching in a range of scenarios such as live surgery and international teleconferencing. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review are promising and demonstrate that telemedicine has a role to play in improving clinical effectiveness and education within gynaecology. Its applications have been shown to be safe and effective in providing remote care and training. In the future, randomised controlled studies involving larger numbers of patients and operators with measurable outcomes are required in order to be able to draw reliable conclusions.","output":"Evaluating the use of telemedicine in gynaecological practice: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To assess clinical outcomes and adverse drug events in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 treated with off-label hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (Az). METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalised patients who had a positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 and received HCQ plus Az or no targeted therapy. The primary end point was clinical improvement on day 7 defined as either hospital discharge or an improvement of 2 points on a 6-category ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included mortality at day 28, intensive care admission, requirement for mechanical ventilation and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: Data from a total of 134 patients were evaluated; 82 patients received HCQ/Az and 52 patients received no targeted therapy. Clinical improvement was seen in 26.8% of patients who received HCQ/Az but this was not significant. The rates of intensive care transfer and mechanical ventilation were higher in the treatment group, but these differences were not significant. Mortality at day 28 was significantly higher in the treatment group (P = .03). Hypoglycaemia elevated liver function tests and QT prolongation were monitored in both groups. The risk of QT prolongation was significantly higher in the treatment group. Treatment was stopped early in 6 (7.3%) patients due to adverse events. CONCLUSION: Although patients who received HCQ/Az were more severely ill the administration of these repurposed drugs did not result in clinical improvement and was associated with a significant increase in toxicity.

Immunoproteasomes are specialized types of proteasomes involved in shaping adaptive immune responses, but their role in innate immune signaling is still elusive. Here, we analyzed immunoproteasome function for polarization of alveolar macrophages, highly specialized tissue macrophages of the alveolar lung surface. Classical activation (M1 polarization) of primary alveolar macrophages by LPS/IFN transcriptionally induced all three immunoproteasome subunits, low molecular mass protein 2 (LMP2), LMP7 and multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1, which was accompanied by increased immunoproteasome activity in M1 cells. Deficiency of LMP7 had no effect on the LPS/IFN-triggered M1 profile indicating that immunoproteasome function is dispensable for classical alveolar macrophage activation. In contrast, IL-4 triggered alternative (M2) activation of primary alveolar macrophages was accompanied by a transcriptionally independent amplified expression of LMP2 and LMP7 and an increase in immunoproteasome activity. Alveolar macrophages from LMP7 knockout mice disclosed a distorted M2 profile upon IL-4 stimulation as characterized by increased M2 marker gene expression and CCL17 cytokine release. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of IL-4-responsive genes and of genes involved in cellular response to defense, wounding and inflammation in LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages indicating a distinct M2 inflammation resolving phenotype. Moreover, augmented M2 polarization was accompanied by amplified AKT/STAT6 activation and increased RNA and protein expression of the M2 master transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 in LMP7(?/?) alveolar macrophages. IL-13 stimulation of LMP7-deficient macrophages induced a similar M2-skewed profile indicative for augmented signaling via the IL-4 receptor  (IL4R). IL4R expression was generally elevated only on protein but not RNA level in LMP7(?/?) alveolar macrophages. Importantly, specific catalytic inhibition with an LMP7-specific proteasome inhibitor confirmed augmented IL-4-mediated M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages. Our results thus suggest a novel role of immunoproteasome function for regulating alternative activation of macrophages by limiting IL4R expression and signaling.","output":"Immunoproteasome dysfunction augments alternative polarization of alveolar macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While educators uses of social media for purposes such as professional learning and networking are now well-established, our understanding of how educational institutions use social mediaincluding to engage key stakeholders during periods of crisisis limited.

Ultrasound sonograms have been confirmed to illustrate damage to a person's lungs, which means that the correct classification and scoring of a patient's sonogram can be used to assess lung involvement. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to establish a lung involvement assessment model based on deep learning. A novel multimodal channel and receptive field attention network combined with ResNeXt (MCRFNet) was proposed to classify sonograms, and the network can automatically fuse shallow features and determine the importance of different channels and respective fields. Finally, sonogram classes were transformed into scores to evaluate lung involvement from the initial diagnosis to rehabilitation.

The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection.

The Internet provides social stations and the public with an efficient means for interactive communication and an open space for active information sharing and public participation. For example, while the website of an organization such as an environmental activist group can initially trigger local interest, the Internet allows this information to be disseminated to a much wider audience in a manner unavailable to the traditional media. Interaction among social stations demonstrates an amplifying process of public attention to the risk. Analyses of the volume of readers' comments to online newspaper articles and public opinions posted on message board of public and nonprofit organizations show the ripple effects of the amplification process as measured along temporal, geographical, and sectoral dimensions.

This study compared the positive subjective drug effects of a newly developed extended-release (ER) oxycodone (OC)/acetaminophen (acetyl-para-aminophenol [APAP]) formulation with those of immediate-release (IR) OC/APAP. METHODS This randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, 7-way crossover study enrolled healthy volunteers who were recreational prescription opioid users. The protocol was approved by an institutional review board and all participants provided written informed consent. Participants received single doses of intact ER and IR OC/APAP 15/650 mg, intact ER and IR OC/APAP 30/1300 mg, crushed ER and IR OC/APAP 30/1300 mg, and placebo. Peak subjective effects (Emax), time to Emax, and area under the drug-effect curves for drug liking, drug high, and good drug effects were measured using visual analogue scales. Least squares means with 95% confidence interval were compared using analysis of variance. RESULTS Among completers (N = 55), intact ER OC/APAP produced delayed and lower peak effects versus IR OC/APAP. Comparing intact tablets, the drug liking Emax (least squares means [95% confidence interval]) was significantly lower for OC/APAP 30/1300 mg (76.4 [72.8 to 80.0]) than for IR OC/APAP 30/1300 mg (85.6 [81.9 to 89.2]; difference, -9.2 [-13.1 to -5.2]; P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for intact ER and IR OC/APAP (15 mg/650 mg). Crushing ER OC/APAP 30/1300 mg further delayed these effects compared with the same dose of crushed IR OC/APAP and intact ER OC/APAP. CONCLUSIONS Extended-release OC/APAP produced lower subjective drug effects than IR OC/APAP. Crushing ER OC/APAP further delayed onset of subjective effects compared with intact ER OC/APAP.

Also full-length 16S rDNA gene sequencing was used to verify the partial (V3-V4) sequencing results obtained in 2017. Measures of &#945;-diversity displayed transgenic 2A5 to be significantly lower in species richness at the flowering stage; however, diversity remained undisturbed. ?-diversity was least affected by genetic modifications where similar community profiles were shared by transgenic 2A5 and control Z58. In addition, root exudation patterns were found to drive variations in bacterial assemblages based on developmental stages. For example, genus Massilia successfully colonized the rhizosphere at jointing stage, while Mucilaginobacter showed higher relative abundance in flowering stages of both 2A5 and Z58. These members are known to possess attributes related to plant growth. The impact of dual-transgene insertion on nifH gene abundance was also analyzed where no apparent significant difference in nifH gene copy number was observed.

Clearly, this has important implications for preventive measures, vaccination, and future therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19. Furthermore, we will highlight important knowledge gaps and provide suggestions for future research and recommendations for policy actions. Since many new reports on COVID-19 rapidly appear, the present perspective should be seen as a focus for discussion to drive forward further understanding, research initiatives, and clinical management of COVID-19.","output":"Obesity and COVID-19: A Perspective from the European Association for the Study of Obesity on Immunological Perturbations, Therapeutic Challenges, and Opportunities in Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between parental and teacher support and elementary students academic skills during the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on data of an ongoing longitudinal study, we studied the roles of childrens (N = 63) academic skills before the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany (MarchCJune 2020) as predictors of individual differences in parental schoolwork support during the lockdown, and the contributions of parental and teacher support to students reading and mathematics skills after the lockdown. Findings indicated that childrens reading and mathematics skills before the lockdown predicted parental help, and reading skills predicted parental need-oriented support with schoolwork during the lockdown. Children who received more need-oriented support from parents showed a more favorable development of arithmetic skills across the lockdown. Indicators of teacher support did not explain individual differences in students academic skills after the lockdown period. ?

In this study, we searched for novel antifungal activities in the Pandemic Response Box, a collection of 400 structurally diverse compounds in various phases of drug discovery. We identified five molecules which could control the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans, Cryptococcus deuterogattii, and the emerging global threat Candida auris. After eliminating compounds which demonstrated paradoxical antifungal effects or toxicity to mammalian macrophages, we selected compound MMV1593537 as a nontoxic, fungicidal molecule for further characterization of antifungal activity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that MMV1593537 affected cellular division in all three pathogens. In Cryptococcus, MMV1593537 caused a reduction in capsular dimensions. Treatment with MMV1593537 resulted in increased detection of cell wall chitooligomers in these three species. Since chitooligomers are products of the enzymatic hydrolysis of chitin, we investigated whether surface chitinase activity was altered in response to MMV1593537 exposure. We observed peaks of enzyme activity in C. neoformans and C. deuterogattii in response to MMV1593537. We did not detect any surface chitinase activity in C. auris. Our results suggest that MMV1593537 is a promising, nontoxic fungicide whose mechanism of action, at least in Cryptococcus spp, requires chitinase-mediated hydrolysis of chitin. IMPORTANCE The development of novel antifungals is a matter of urgency. In this study, we evaluated antifungal activities in a collection of 400 molecules, using highly lethal fungal pathogens as targets. One of these molecules, namely, MMV1593537, was not toxic to host cells and controlled the growth of isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans, C. deuterogattii, C. gattii, Candida auris, C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei. We tested the mechanisms of antifungal action of MMV1593537 in the Cryptococcus and C. auris models and concluded that the compound affects the cell wall, a structure which is essential for fungal life. At least in Cryptococcus, this effect involved chitinase, an enzyme which is required for remodeling the cell wall. Our results suggest that MMV1593537 is a candidate for future antifungal development.","output":"Screening of the Pandemic Response Box Reveals an Association between Antifungal Effects of MMV1593537 and the Cell Wall of Cryptococcus neoformans, Cryptococcus deuterogattii, and Candida auris."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health issue Neurological complications have been reported in up to one-third of affected cases, but their distribution varies significantly in terms of prevalence, incidence and phenotypical characteristics Variability can be mostly explained by the differing sources of cases (hospital vs community-based), the accuracy of the diagnostic approach, and the interpretation of the patients' complaints Moreover, after recovering, patients can still experience neurological symptoms To obtain a more precise picture of the neurological manifestations and outcome of the COVID-19 infection, an international registry (ENERGY) has been created by the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) in collaboration with European national neurological societies and the Neurocritical Care Society and Research Network (NCRN) ENERGY can be implemented as a stand-alone instrument for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients AND neurological findings or as an addendum to an existing registry not targeting neurologic symptoms Data are also collected to study the impact of neurological symptoms and neurological complications on outcomes The variables included in the registry have been selected in the interest of most countries, to favour pooling with data from other sources, and to facilitate data collection even in resource-poor countries Included are adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, ascertained through neurological consultation, and providing informed consent Key demographic and clinical findings are collected at registration Patients are followed up to 12 months in search of incident neurological manifestations As of August 19, 254 centres from 69 countries and four continents have made requests to join the study","output":"The EAN COVID-19 registry (ENERGY): An international instrument for surveillance of neurological complications in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is still examining possibilities of elimination of the COVID-19 virus and there are many of them One of the important country-specific action is disc","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey and Kerala, India: Some Observations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To evaluate changes in immunological parameters following subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) administration of meperidine in horses through quantitative analysis of plasma tryptase, histamine, and IgE levels.

Identified as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the number of cases grew rapidly by human-to-human transmission in Wuhan. Social media, especially Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media site), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and seek help. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who asked for help on Sina Weibo. METHODS: We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. In total, 9878 posts seeking help on Sina Weibo from February 3 to 20, 2020 were analyzed. We used a descriptive research methodology to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. The distance between patients' home and the nearest designated hospital was calculated using the geographic information system ArcGIS. RESULTS: All patients included in this study who sought help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR 55.0-71.0). Fever (408/485, 84.12%) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (237/314, 75.48%) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography; 39.67% (167/421) of families had suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed family members; 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed members; and 70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their relatives for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR 6.0-12.0). Of 481 patients, 32.22% (n=155) lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest designated hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that patients seeking help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan and most were elderly. Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography. The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital. Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan's lockdown. These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.","output":"Mining the Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients in China: Analysis of Social Media Posts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the authors develop a method of detecting correlations between epidemic patterns in different regions that are due to human movement and introduce a null model in which the travel-induced correlations are cancelled. They apply this method to the well-documented cases of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the United States and France. In the United States (using data for 1972-2002), the authors observed strong short-range correlations between several states and their immediate neighbors, as well as robust long-range spreading patterns resulting from large domestic air-traffic flows. The stability of these results over time allowed the authors to draw conclusions about the possible impact of travel restrictions on epidemic spread. The authors also applied this method to the case of France (1984-2004) and found that on the regional scale, there was no transportation mode that clearly dominated disease spread. The simplicity and robustness of this method suggest that it could be a useful tool for detecting transmission channels in the spread of epidemics.","output":"Detecting Robust Patterns in the Spread of Epidemics: A Case Study of Influenza in the United States and France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The association between age at fist calving (AFC) and production, fertility and survivability in Jersey heifers requires evaluation and comparison with published literature on Holstein heifers. METHOD Lactation records from 7256 pedigree Jersey heifers were grouped by AFC. Analysis comprised mixed effects multivariable regression modelling and binary logistic regression modelling. RESULTS Increased lifetime daily yield (LDY) was significantly associated with a reduced AFC; calving UK Jersey heifers at 24 months or below is optimal. Heifers calving at 25-26 months had a significantly lower mean calving interval (391 days; 95 per cent CI 386 to 397) than those calving over 30 months (399; 95 per cent CI 394 to 405) (P=0.03). Heifers with an AFC over 30 months were less likely to survive to second lactation than those with an AFC 18-24 months. Spring calving heifers produced significantly less milk per day (9.87 kg; 95 per cent CI 9.64 to 10.1) than autumn (10.18; 95 per cent CI 9.94 to 10.41) or winter calvers (10.07; 95 per cent CI 9.84 to 10.3) (P0.01). Heifers that calved in the winter had a significantly shorter calving interval (389 days; 95 per cent CI 394 to 383) (P0.01) than heifers calved in other seasons.

We developed an ex vivo model with human airway epithelial (HAE) cells harvested from lung biopsies to study Spn colonisation and translocation. Flow-cytometry, confocal imaging and electron microscopy studies identified the epithelial lineage with signs of differentiation (beating cilia, mucus, and tight junctions). HAE cells were challenged with Spn wild-type TIGR4 (wtSpn) or its isogenic {Delta}comC quorum sensing-deficient mutant. {Delta}comC mutant colonised significantly less than wtSpn at 6 h post-inoculation but at significantly higher levels at 19 h and 30 h. Translocation correlated inversely with colonisation density. Transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) decreased after pneumococcal infection and correlated with increased translocation for both strains. Confocal imaging illustrated colocalisation of intracellular Spn with both cilia and zonulin-1 and prominent microcolony formation with wtSpn but disintegration of microcolony structures over time with {Delta}comC mutant. {Delta}comC caused a more pronounced release of both zonulin-1 and lactate dehydrogenase into the supernatant at later time points than wtSpn, suggesting that cytotoxicity is likely not the mechanism leading to translocation. There was a density- and time-dependent increase of inflammatory cytokines from human HAE cells infected with {Delta}comC compared with wtSpn, including increased levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome-related IL-18. In conclusion, our experiments indicate that ComC system allows a higher organisational level of population structure resulting in microcolony formation, increased early colonisation and subsequent translocation. We propose that ComC inactivation unleashes a very different and possibly more virulent phenotype that merits further investigation.","output":"The quorum sensing com system regulates pneumococcal colonisation and invasive disease in a pseudo-stratified airway tissue model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A history of Lyme disease can complicate the interpretation of Lyme disease serology in acutely symptomatic patients.

METHODS: The expression of fourteen common used reference genes of Oryza sativa L. were evaluated by RT-qPCR in RSV and RBSDV infected rice plants. Suitable normalization reference gene(s) were identified by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. RESULTS: UBQ 10 + GAPDH and UBC + Actin1 were identified as suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization under RSV and RBSDV infection, respectively. When using multiple reference genes, the expression patterns of OsPRIb and OsWRKY, two virus resistance genes, were approximately similar with that reported previously. Comparatively, by using single reference gene (TIP41-Like), a weaker inducible response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed that the combination of two reference genes could obtain more accurate and reliable normalization of RT-qPCR results in RSV- and RBSDV-infected plants. This work therefore sheds light on establishing a standardized RT-qPCR procedure in RSV- and RBSDV-infected rice plants, and might serve as an important point for discovering complex regulatory networks and identifying genes relevant to biological processes or implicated in virus.

We propose a deep learning-based method to detect stigmatized contents on online social network (OSN) platforms in the early stage of COVID-19. Our method performs a semantic-based quantitative analysis to unveil essential spatial-temporal characteristics of COVID-19 stigmatization for timely alerts and risk mitigation. Empirical evaluations are carried out to examine our method's predictive utilities. The visualization results of the co-occurrence network using Gephi indicate two distinct groups of stigmatized words that pertain to people in Wuhan and their dietary behaviors, respectively. Netizens' participations and stigmatizations in the Hubei region, where the COVID-19 broke out, are twice (p < 0.05) and four (p <0.01) times more frequent and intense than those in other parts of China, respectively. Also, the number of COVID-19 patients is correlated with COVID-19-related stigma significantly (correlation coefficient = 0.838, p <0.01).

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate all published studies that investigated the effects of BCAAs on seizures, emphasizing therapeutic efficacy and possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS On 31 January, 2017, the following databases were searched for relevant studies: MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), Scopus (Elsevier), the Cochrane Library, and the unindexed material in PubMed (National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health). The searches were repeated in all databases on 18 February, 2019. We only included full-length preclinical and clinical studies that were published in the English language that examined the effects of BCAA administration on seizures. RESULTS Eleven of 2045 studies met our inclusion criteria: ten studies were conducted in animal models and one study in human subjects. Seven seizure models were investigated: the strychnine (one study), pentylenetetrazole (two studies), flurothyl (one study), picrotoxin (two studies), genetic absence epilepsy in rats (one study), kainic acid (two studies), and methionine sulfoximine (one study) paradigms. Three studies investigated the effect of a BCAA mixture whereas the other studies explored the effects of individual BCAAs on seizures. In most animal models and in humans, BCAAs had potent anti-seizure effects. However, in the methionine sulfoximine model, long-term BCAA supplementation worsened seizure propagation and caused neuron loss, and in the genetic absence epilepsy in rats model, BCAAs exhibited pro-seizure effects. CONCLUSIONS The contradictory effects of BCAAs on seizure activity likely reflect differences in the complex mechanisms that underlie seizure disorders. Some of these mechanisms are likely mediated by BCAA's effects on glucose, glutamate, glutamine, and ammonia metabolism, activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathway, and their effects on aromatic amino acid transport and neurotransmitter synthesis. We propose that a better understanding of mechanisms by which BCAAs affect seizures and neuronal viability is needed to advance the field of BCAA supplementation in epilepsy.","output":"Branched-Chain Amino Acids and Seizures: A Systematic Review of the Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)Cmitochondria contact sites (ERMCSs) are crucial for multiple cellular processes such as calcium signaling, lipid transport, and mitochondrial dynamics. However, the molecular organization, functions, regulation of ERMCS, and the physiological roles of altered ERMCSs are not fully understood in higher eukaryotes. We found that Miga, a mitochondrion located protein, markedly increases ERMCSs and causes severe neurodegeneration upon overexpression in fly eyes. Miga interacts with an ER protein Vap33 through its FFAT-like motif and an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease related Vap33 mutation considerably reduces its interaction with Miga. Multiple serine residues inside and near the Miga FFAT motif were phosphorylated, which is required for its interaction with Vap33 and Miga-mediated ERMCS formation. The interaction between Vap33 and Miga promoted further phosphorylation of upstream serine/threonine clusters, which fine-tuned Miga activity. Protein kinases CKI and CaMKII contribute to Miga hyperphosphorylation. MIGA2, encoded by the miga mammalian ortholog, has conserved functions in mammalian cells. We propose a model that shows Miga interacts with Vap33 to mediate ERMCSs and excessive ERMCSs lead to neurodegeneration.","output":"Miga-mediated endoplasmic reticulumCmitochondria contact sites regulate neuronal homeostasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The p53 transcription factor plays a key role both in cancer and in the cell-intrinsic response to infections.

In addition, admission and in-hospital measures for kidney abnormalities have not been studied separately. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study aimed to analyze these associations in 321 patients sequentially admitted between March 7, 2020 and April 1, 2020 at Stony Brook University Medical Center, New York. We investigated the association of proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI with outcomes of inflammation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and in-hospital death. We used ANOVA, t test, &#967;2 test, and Fisher's exact test for bivariate analyses and logistic regression for multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Three hundred patients met the inclusion criteria for the study cohort. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that admission proteinuria was significantly associated with risk of in-hospital AKI (OR 4.71, 95% CI 1.28-17.38), while admission hematuria was associated with ICU admission (OR 4.56, 95% CI 1.12-18.64), IMV (OR 8.79, 95% CI 2.08-37.00), and death (OR 18.03, 95% CI 2.84-114.57).

Our aims were to determine whether rOv-ASP-1 is immunostimulatory for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and, if so, whether it could augment cellular responses against human pathogen antigens in vitro. Cytokines from rOv-ASP-1-stimulated human PBMC were measured by a fluorescence activated cell sorter-based multiplex assay.

We explored how concomitant medication use relates to clinical response to a standard course of rTMS. METHODS Medications were tabulated for 181 MDD patients who underwent a six-week rTMS treatment course. All patients received 10 Hz rTMS administered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), with 1 Hz administered to right DLPFC in patients with inadequate response to and/or intolerance of left-sided stimulation. Primary outcomes were change in Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (IDS-SR30) total score after 2, 4, and 6 weeks. RESULTS Use of benzodiazepines was associated with less improvement at week 2, whereas use of psychostimulants was associated with greater improvement at week 2 and across 6 weeks. These effects were significant controlling for baseline variables including age, overall symptom severity, and severity of anxiety symptoms.

METHODS: This is a separate-sample Mendelian randomisation study using publicly available data. We applied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with plasma vitamin C, in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) as genetic instruments to the GWAS of severe COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalisation and any infection in the COVID-19 host genetics initiative and the GWAS of pneumonia in the UK Biobank, to assess whether people with genetically predicted higher levels of plasma vitamin C had lower risk of severe COVID-19 and pneumonia.

Age > 45 years (OR = 2.01; 95% C.I. = 2.01-4.3), absence of fear over vaccine safety (OR = 4.09; 95% C.I. = 1.36-12.3), and information received from the Greek public health authorities (OR = 11.14; 95% C.I. = 5.48-22.6), were factors independently associated with the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance. Our study indicates a high level of the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance among physicians, dentists and pharmacists. Nevertheless, several interventions can be implemented to increase acceptance of vaccine among health-care workers (HCWs) and could be especially directed at younger and vaccine-hesitant health care workers due to fear of vaccine side-effects. Last, our results provide some evidence that receiving vaccine-related information from the Greek Center for Diseases Control (E.O.D.Y.) could reduce the drivers of hesitancy and enhance the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"Acceptability of COVID-19 Vaccination among Greek Health Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Yersinia pestis is the etiologic agent of plague that has killed more than 200 million people throughout the recorded history of mankind. Antibiotics may provide little immediate relief to patients who have a high bacteremia or to patients infected with an antibiotic resistant strain of plague. Two virulent factors of Y. pestis are the capsid F1 protein and the low-calcium response (Lcr) V-protein or V-antigen that have been proven to be the targets for both active and passive immunization. There are mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the F1- and V-antigens that can passively protect mice in a murine model of plague; however, there are no anti-Yersinia pestis monoclonal antibodies available for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment in humans. We identified one anti-F1-specific human mAb (m252) and two anti-V-specific human mAb (m253, m254) by panning a na?ve phage-displayed Fab library against the F1- and V-antigens. The Fabs were converted to IgG1s and their binding and protective activities were evaluated. M252 bound weakly to peptides located at the F1 N-terminus where a protective mouse anti-F1 mAb also binds. M253 bound strongly to a V-antigen peptide indicating a linear epitope; m254 did not bind to any peptide from a panel of 53 peptides suggesting that its epitope may be conformational. M252 showed better protection than m253 and m254 against a Y, pestis challenge in a plague mouse model. A synergistic effect was observed when the three antibodies were combined. Incomplete to complete protection was achieved when m252 was given at different times post-challenge. These antibodies can be further studied to determine their potential as therapeutics or prophylactics in Y. pestis infection in humans.","output":"Human Anti-Plague Monoclonal Antibodies Protect Mice from Yersinia pestis in a Bubonic Plague Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1007/s11150-020-09536-5.].","output":"Correction to: The impact of closing schools on working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence using panel data from Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a worldwide distribution.

In this paper, a total of 192 critically ill patients (142 were discharged and 50 died in the hospital) with COVID-19 were included. Self-evaluation indicators including demographics, baseline characteristics and symptoms and detailed lab-examination indicators were extracted. Data were first compared between survivors and non-survivors. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was performed to identify possible risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 patients. MVPA achieved a relatively high classification accuracy of 93% when using both self-evaluation indicators and laboratory-examination indicators. Several self-evaluation factors related to COVID-19 were highly associated with mortality, including age, duration (time from illness onset to admission), and the Barthel index score. When the duration, age and Barthel index increased by one day, one year and one point, the mortality increased by 3.6%, 2.4% and 0.9% respectively. Laboratory-examination indicators including C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count, fibrin degradation products (FDP), oxygenation index (OI), lymphocyte count and D-dimer were also risk factors. Among them, duration was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality. Several self-evaluation indicators that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without clinical examination were the risk factors of all-cause mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

In this study, we evaluated a series of molecules based on the plant (Cedrus deodara) derived &#945;,?,?3-Himachalenes scaffolds. RESULTS: The results obtained from estimated affinity and ligand efficiency suggested that BCH10, BCH15, BCH16, and BCH17 could act as potential inhibitors of Nsp1. Moreover, MD simulations comprising various MD driven time-dependent analyses and thermodynamic free energy calculations also suggested stable protein-ligand complexes and strong interactions with the binding site. Furthermore, the selected molecules passed drug likeliness parameters and the physiochemical property analysis showed acceptable bioactivity scores.

In addition to worries about physical health, it also causes concerns about psychological and mental health. This research aims to explore predictors affecting psychological well-being during the pandemic using the 2018 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) RAND longitudinal data (N = 42,233) and the 2020 HRS COVID-19 module (N = 3,266). Demographics (i.e., gender, age, and education), psychosocial (i.e., personality traits), and health (i.e., comorbidity) variables were included in multivariate logistic and ordinary least square regression analyses predicting feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and lonely during the pandemic. Our results indicated that neuroticism was positively associated with all outcomes. Women were more likely to feel overwhelmed, stressed, and lonely compared to men. Age negatively predicted the overwhelmed and stressed feelings. Furthermore, the effect of depressive symptoms in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 on psychological well-being was assessed by conducting a latent growth curve model. Findings indicate that initial level and increasing change of depressive symptoms over four-time points (waves 11-14) were positively related to psychological feelings. A higher level of depressive symptoms at the initial level of 2012 and increasing reports of depression symptoms predicted higher rates of being stressed, feeling overwhelmed, and lonely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although the conventional neutralization test (cVNT) remains the gold standard to confirm the presence of neutralizing antibodies in sera, the test is too labour-intensive for massive screening programs and less reproducible as live virus and cell culture is involved. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of a commercially available surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT, GenScript cPass) that can be done without biosafety level 3 containment in less than 2 hours. When using the cVNT and a Luminex multiplex immunoassay (MIA) as reference, the sVNT obtained a sensitivity of 94% (CI 90-96%) on a panel of 317 immune sera that were obtained from hospitalized and mild COVID-19 cases from Belgium and a sensitivity of 89% (CI 81-93%) on a panel of 184 healthcare workers from the Democratic Republic of Congo. We also found strong antibody titer correlations (rs>0.8) among the different techniques used.

Methods Information of the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer and data about the HDI 2019 were obtained from the World Bank database. The correlation between incidence, mortality rates, and the HDI parameters were assessed using linear regression. We calculated concentration index (CI) to measure socioeconomic inequality in COVID-19 related mortality & incidence. Results linear regression analysis showed a direct significant correlation between the incidence and mortality rate from COVID-19 and HDI at the global level. The concentration index was positive for incidence rate (0.62) and mortality rate (0.69) of COVID-19, indicating the higher concentration of the rates among groups with high HDI. Conclusions The high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in countries with high and very high HDI are remarkable which should be the top priority of interventions for global health policymakers.

The supply chain industry is severely affected due to the COVID-19 outbreak and industry practitioners are focusing on minimizing the ripple effect of the disruption made to the economy. Considering the unprecedented situation, the research is motivated to analyse the ripple effect in a multi-echelon supply chain and investigate the performance at various nodes to understand the capability of the supply chain to withstand the disruptions at different levels. Using discrete event simulation, this study analyses the ripple effect in the copper industry by an agent-based simulation software anyLogistix, considering various key performance indexes (KPIs) to gauge the magnitude. From the results of the simulation, it is evident that the lack of safety stocks and multi-sourcing of copper facilitate as major causes for the disruptions. The simulation helps to understand the disruption levels and make the supply chain more resilient and robust for any future disruption. Further, the study proposes resilient project management solutions to recover from the cascading ripple effect in the copper supply chain. The scientific contribution of the research is to provide supply chain managers with simulation techniques to understand the ripple effect on the copper supply chain. It helps the stakeholders to understand the importance of project management tools to reduce the cascading ripple effect in a copper supply chain.

RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual number of own observations of spontaneous pneumomediastinum did not exceed 1-2 patients. The mechanism of pneumomediastinum is explained by the Macklin effect. COVID-19 pandemic in the Russian Federation was followed by increase of the number of patients with pneumomediastinum up to 2.4% of the total number of patients in the thoracic department.

The timing of pneumomediastinum ranged from 2 to 18 (median 14) days after clinical manifestation of COVID-19. In 2 out of 14 cases, pneumomediastinum was the main symptom of coronavirus infection at admission. One patient had a combination of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. In 6 cases, pneumomediastinum was stable and regressed under conservative therapy. Eight patients underwent Razumovsky suprajugular mediastinotomy. There were no postoperative deaths.

Observed concentrations at all available ground monitoring sites (240 and 480 for NO2 and PM2.5, respectively) were compared between April 2020 and April of the prior five years, 2015-2019, as the baseline. Large statistically significant decreases in NO2 concentrations were found at more than 65% of the monitoring sites, with an average drop of 2 ppb when compared to the mean of the previous five years. The same patterns are confirmed by satellite-derived NO2 column totals from NASA OMI. PM2.5 concentrations from the ground monitoring sites, however, were more likely to be higher. The second goal of this study is to explain the different responses of the two pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis put forward is that the shelter-in-place measures affected peoples' driving patterns most dramatically, thus passenger vehicle NO2 emissions were reduced. Commercial vehicles and electricity demand for all purposes remained relatively unchanged, thus PM2.5 concentrations did not drop significantly. To establish a correlation between the observed NO2 changes and the extent to which people were sheltering in place, we use a mobility index, which was produced and made public by Descartes Labs. This mobility index aggregates cell phone usage at the county level to capture changes in human movement over time. We found a strong correlation between the observed decreases in NO2 concentrations and decreases in human mobility. By contrast, no discernible pattern was detected between mobility and PM2.5 concentrations changes, suggesting that decreases in personal-vehicle traffic alone may not be effective at reducing PM2.5 pollution.","output":"Changes in air quality and human mobility in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques across all disciplines has exploded in the past few years, with the ever-growing size of data and the changing needs of higher education, such as digital education.

Methods: Multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive characteristics over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. We evaluated age, sex, reason for testing, risk factors, symptoms, and expected PCR result for their impact on the test result. Results: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing and were included in this analysis. A fraction of 10.7% (n=40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97).

The study aimed at assessing symptom dynamics, potentially increased adversities and factors influencing a successful transition into teletherapy in adolescent psychiatric outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD Thirty adolescent psychiatric outpatients participated in an interview-based study. The differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was measured by integrating patients' and psychiatrists' judgements. RESULTS Patients who reported deteriorated symptoms and patients who showed (partial) improvement of symptomatology could be separated by feelings of isolation (specific to deterioration) and perceived reduction in school-associated stress (unique to improvement). Patients with worsening symptomatology showed a significantly higher degree of psychosocial disability before lockdown and at the first interview. Patients who deteriorated in their level of psychosocial functioning also reported negatively on teletherapy. These patients were verbally less differentiated concerning emotions and affect, reported introspection and rumination, and stated distinctly lower levels of perceived social support. Concerning adversities, no clear trend could be identified, but some patients reported increased domestic violence and neglect. CONCLUSIONS Patients with a higher degree of psychosocial disability suffer disproportionally from the crisis, so that an assessment of functioning should serve as a triage tool. Also, a screening of the perceived level of social support should be established before offering teletherapy. Additionally, the provision of strategies to enhance verbalisation and differentiation of emotions and affect might be beneficial.","output":"'The world somehow stopped moving': impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent psychiatric outpatients and the implementation of teletherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The burden of infections on an individual and public health is profound.

Refinements of surgery have improved warm ischemia times and facilitated renal reconstruction. We present a technique that makes renorrhaphy easier using Self-Retaining Barbed Suture (SRBS) weaving two threads. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two patients with carcinoma of the kidney, 3.4 and 1.5 cm respectively, were subjected to the LPN. The SRBS is an absorbable polygluconate with small projections along its axis which are anchored in the tissue, distributing the tension of the suture line and eliminating the need for knots. Renorrhaphy was performed using the SRBS by two continuous suture lines without knots, setting the sutures with clips of Hem-o-lok(?) and adjusting it with the technique of ?sliding clip?, without placing ?bolsters? inside the renal parenchymal defect. RESULTS Operative time was 156 minutes and 163 minutes, intraoperative bleeding was 50 ml and 850 ml, the warm ischemia time was 14.3 minutes and 23 minutes and follow-up time was 7 months and 3 months in the first and second cases respectively. The hospital stay was 5 days and there were no postoperative complications.

In this research, we examined Finnish social workers' experiences of their work communities during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored (1) how the restrictive measures affected social workers' work communities and (2) what types of factors promoted and challenged the cohesion of social networks and mutual trust between colleagues.

We also show that PheoA prevents coronavirus entry into the cells by directly targeting the viral particle. Besides SARS-CoV-2, PheoA also displayed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against (+) strand RNA viral pathogens such as HCV, West Nile, and other coronaviruses, but not against (-) strand RNA viruses, such as VSV. Our results indicate that PheoA displays a remarkable potency and a satisfactory therapeutic index, which together with its previous use in photoactivable cancer therapy in humans, suggest that it may be considered as a potential candidate for antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 fears green: the chlorophyll catabolite Pheophorbide a is a potent antiviral"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Orthopaedic and rehabilitation physicians often instruct patients to elevate a traumatized or postoperative lower extremity. Elevation is thought to improve patient comfort, as well as decrease swelling, wound complications, and the risk of compartment syndrome. Elevating a limb with increased compartment pressures, however, has been shown to reduce perfusion pressure and contribute to tissue ischemia. This investigation aims to advance our understanding of the tissue effects of limb elevation using a healthy patient model. OBJECTIVE To quantify the effects of elevation, experimentally induced ischemia, and immobilization on muscle oxygen saturation in the human leg using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). DESIGN Experimental crossover study. SETTING Orthopaedic Surgery research laboratory, Stanford Hospitals & Clinics. PATIENTS FOR PARTICIPATION Twenty-six healthy volunteers. METHODS Using transcutaneous sensors, we measured muscle oxygen saturation of the anterior compartment of the left (control) leg at 0, 15, and 30 cm of elevation relative to the heart using NIRS. A standardized short leg splint and a thigh tourniquet inflated to 50 mmHg were then applied to the right (experimental) leg to simulate a traumatized state. NIRS measurements were then repeated, again at 0, 15, and 30 cm of elevation. Muscle oxygen saturation values at various degrees of elevation of the control and experimental limb were then compared and analyzed by the use of a crossover study design and mixed-effects regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Muscle oxygen saturation at varying levels of elevation in both the (1) control leg and (2) experimental leg in a simulated traumatic state. RESULTS Male (18) males and female (8) patients between 22 and 62 years of age (mean 29.8 years) were enrolled. Mean regional muscle oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the control limbs at 0, 15 and, 30 cm of elevation were 74.2%, 72.5%, and 70.6%, respectively, whereas mean rSO2 of the experimental limbs were 66.3%, 65.0%, and 63.3%. A statistically significant decrease of rSO2 was observed (mean 7.65%) in the experimental limbs compared with the control limbs. As elevation increased, there was a statistically significant decrease in rSO2 of 0.12% per centimeter of elevation. Elevation did not decrease the rSO2 in the experimental limb to a greater degree than in the control limb. CONCLUSION Increasing levels of elevation in a human limb results in progressively compromised muscle oxygen saturation as measured by NIR.","output":"The Effects of Limb Elevation on Muscle Oxygen Saturation: A Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study in Humans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To compare outcomes between laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (LSPDP) and open spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (OSPDP) for treatment of benign and low-grade malignant tumors of the pancreas and evaluate feasibility and safety of LSPDP.

An objective marker is needed to track consumption of supplements to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate saccharin and resveratrol as potential adherence markers for tracking recent consumption of a single serving of SQ-LNS in women. METHODS: Forty-seven healthy nonpregnant women 18C45 y of age were assigned to consume a single dose of SQ-LNS (20 g) containing either 10 mg sodium saccharin or 5 mg trans-resveratrol, under supervision. On the day before and for 2 d following SQ-LNS consumption, urine samples were collected each day for 24 h as 3 consecutive 4-h collections and one 12-h overnight collection. Urinary concentrations of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, a resveratrol metabolite, were measured by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography interfaced to a mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization [UHPLC-(ESI-)MS/MS]. Urinary concentrations (mol/L urine) of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate were plotted against time, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the discriminative capacity of each compound, at each post-consumption time point compared with baseline, to detect recent consumption of SQ-LNS. Cutoff values to differentiate supplement consumption from nonconsumption of each marker were developed using the closest-to-(0,1)-corner cut-point approach. RESULTS: Forty-five participants were included in the analysis. Urinary concentrations of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate increased within 4 h of SQ-LNS consumption. Urinary concentration cutoff values for saccharin (13.4 mol/L) and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate (0.7 mol/L) allowed for 78% and 89% sensitivity, respectively, and 100% specificity in detecting consumption of SQ-LNS within the first 12 h after consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary concentrations of saccharin and trans-resveratrol-3-O-sulfate reflect consumption of SQ-LNS containing those compounds during the first 12 h post-consumption with high sensitivity and specificity in healthy women and may be useful objective adherence markers for tracking consumption of SQ-LNS.","output":"Evaluation of Saccharin and Resveratrol as Extrinsic Markers of Small-Quantity Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplement Consumption in Healthy Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April-June 2020 on UV exposure of office workers was assessed using an online survey on time spent outdoors and environmental data for different locations in the UK.

Despite the lack of a single randomized control trial (RCT) with positive results, there are currently (as for the search on 30th of August 2020) more than 250 RCT registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with HCQ in COVID patients, and more than 150 of them are \\"still recruiting\\" or \\"not yet recruiting\\" patients. DATA SOURCES: Our study combines a therapeutic evaluation of RCT data with a sociological analysis of related controversies, examining scientific and public arena discourses.

From a sociological perspective, the HCQ controversy is a useful case study for understanding the construction of plausibility in a cultural context polarized into competing versions of reality, with different epistemologies and ideologies. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the first RCTs have been published, and they are disappointing; beneficial effects of HCQ could not be proven either for negative conversion on polymerase chain reactions of COVID patients or for postexposure prophylaxis. The question to be asked is: how many studies do we need until HCQ is abandoned?

Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were: to update and re-assess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and b) Guillain-Barr syndrome in any population; and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality. The study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in 10 dimensions; temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response, animal experiments, analogy, specificity and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, a multidisciplinary panel of experts assessed the review findings and reached consensus on causality. We found 1091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of 10 causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity) we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For Guillain-Barr syndrome, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified non-systematically from May 30-July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that: a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including 61 microcephaly; and b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barr syndrome is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barr syndrome. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or Guillain-Barr syndrome but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible co-factors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research. Rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed, both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge.

Of 118 children, 99 (83.9%), 60 (50.8%), 43 (36.4%), 26 (22.0%), and 6 (5.1%) had RT-PCR positivity at 14, 21, 28, 35, and 60 d from diagnosis of COVID-19, respectively. Scheduled risk-directed intravenous chemotherapy was delivered in 70 (90.9%) of 77 children on active systemic treatment with a median delay of 14 d (range 0C48 d) and no increased toxicities. All-cause mortality rate was 7.4% (n = 9) and COVID-19 related mortality rate was 4.9% (n = 6). One hundred-fifteen (94.2%) children with COVID-19 did not require any form of respiratory support during the course of infection. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 was not a major deterrent for the continuation of active cancer treatment despite persistent RT-PCR positivity. The long-term assessment of treatment adaptations requires further prospective follow-up and real-time addressal.","output":"COVID-19 in Children with Cancer and Continuation of Cancer-Directed Therapy During the Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OPINION STATEMENT The management of patients with HER2+ breast cancer has evolved significantly over the preceding decades.

International organizations have documented an increase in IPV reports during the current pandemic, raising awareness of the potential causes for such an increase. Reflecting on risk factors associated with IPV, and the underlying need of the perpetrators to exert control over the victims, it becomes increasingly important to understand how the current policies of social distancing, self-isolation, and lockdown can precipitate episodes of IPV. Furthermore, access to specialized services and health care can be compromised, and health care professionals face new challenges and demands imposed by the pandemic while managing IPV cases. This article begins by examining the main risk factors more commonly associated with IPV in the literature. It proceeds by reflecting on how these risk factors may be exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic, which can explain the increased number of reports. Finally, it emphasizes the new challenges faced by health care professionals, while assisting IPV victims during the pandemic and provides possible recommendations on actions to implement during and beyond the Covid-19 pandemic to prevent such cases.","output":"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the precipitation of intimate partner violence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anticipated sequelae of critical care admission for COVID-19 disease remain unclear.

PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: The aim of this work was to assess the relationship between the DOCCR response rates for the communes of the Bouches-du-Rh?ne (BdR) department and the boroughs of Marseille and their poverty levels. The DOCCR response rate was assessed for the 2017-2018 campaign. The Pearson coefficient was calculated to assess correlations with the average poverty rate per commune/borough, the density of general practitioners (GPs) and Potential Localized Accessibility (PLA) to GPs. RESULTS: Among the DOCCR guests, 29.7% ( 4.7) responded. The rate of respondents differed significantly between the communes/boroughs of the department (P < 0.001). The rate of respondents was inversely correlated with the rate of people living below the poverty line, both for the communes/boroughs of the department, with a high correlation (r = - 0.795, P < 0.001) and for the Marseille boroughs, with an even higher correlation (r = - 0.910, P < 0.001). It was inversely correlated with the density of GPs (r = - 0.430, P < 0.001). On the other hand, there was a weak positive correlation with Potential Localized Accessibility to GPs (r = 0.193, P < 0.001), as well as with the age of guests (r = 0.476, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The poverty rate in the BdR, which is higher than the national average, may partly explain the low rate of DOCCR respondents; other factors such as the density of GPs and their accessibility may play a role.","output":"[Colorectal cancer screening participation according to poverty rates in the department of Bouches-du-Rh?ne (France)]./ Participation au dpistage du cancer colorectal selon le taux de pauvret dans les Bouches-du-Rh?ne"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes in influenza viruses require regular reformulation of strain-specific influenza vaccines.

Survey distribution via online COVID-19 support groups and social media Participants. 3,762 respondents from 56 countries completed the survey. 1166 (33.7%) were 40-49 years old, 937 (27.1%) were 50-59 years old, and 905 (26.1%) were 30-39 years old. 2961 (78.9%) were women, 718 (19.1%) were men, and 63 (1.7%) were nonbinary. 8.4% reported being hospitalized. 27% reported receiving a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. 96% reported symptoms beyond 90 days. Results. Prevalence of 205 symptoms in 10 organ systems was estimated in this cohort, with 66 symptoms traced over seven months. Respondents experienced symptoms in an average of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 9.04 to 9.13) organ systems. The most frequent symptoms reported after month 6 were: fatigue (77.7%, 74.9% to 80.3%), post-exertional malaise (72.2%, 69.3% to 75.0%), and cognitive dysfunction (55.4%, 52.4% to 58.8%). These three symptoms were also the three most commonly reported overall. In those who recovered in less than 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at week 2 (11.4, 9.4 to 13.6), and in those who did not recover in 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at month 2 (17.2, 16.5 to 17.8). Respondents with symptoms over 6 months experienced an average of 13.8 (12.7 to 14.9) symptoms in month 7. 94.9% (94.1% to 95.6%) experienced relapses, with exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress as the main triggers. 86.7% (85.6% to 92.5%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7% (38.5% to 50.5%) of recovered respondents. 45.2% (42.9% to 47.2%) reported requiring a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness and 22.3% (20.5% to 24.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to their health conditions.

Vaccine hesitancy, identified as a top threat to global health by the World Health Organization, is a significant barrier to vaccine uptake. With COVID-19 vaccination programs in effect since December 2020, it is critical that vaccination barriers are proactively identified. With limited information surrounding college students perspectives on COVID-19 vaccines, outreach measures will play a pivotal role in vaccine uptake in this population. Development of informative, cohort-driven vaccination campaigns requires proactive assessment of factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, access, and uptake. Objectives The primary objective of this study was to investigate the spectrum of vaccine hesitancy among college students at the University of Rhode Island (URI). The secondary objective was to identify differences in COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy rates in this population. Methods A 22-item, IRB-approved, anonymous questionnaire was developed to survey URI students who voluntarily attended two joint University Health Services and College of Pharmacy influenza vaccination clinics in November 2020. Results A total of 237 vaccination clinic participants consented and responded to at least one question on the survey. Once available to their respective priority group, 92% are very/somewhat likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 50% will receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. Only 3% of participants stated they would never receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The top three reported COVID-19 vaccine-related concerns were safety (37%), effectiveness (24%), and limited information (16%). When asked if COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines should be mandated, 85% and 83%, respectively, were in favor. Conclusion Understanding the spectrum of vaccine hesitancy is critical in achieving COVID-19 community immunity thresholds.

We aimed to identify the specific challenges experienced by contacts of COVID-19 cases to better target support and minimise the harms of self-isolation. Methods The Contact Adherence Behavioural Insights Study (CABINS) was a 15 min telephone survey of contacts of COVID-19 cases, identified through NHS Wales Test Trace Protect (TTP). Quota sampling by age, gender (interlocked), and Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) was used to ensure a representative sample of those in the TTP database. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, living alone, time period, WIMD, and income precarity (financial insecurity) established which subgroups were more likely to experience challenges. Ethical approval was gained from the NHS Research Ethics Committee and the Public Health Wales Research and Development Office. Informed consent was gained from participants at the beginning of the telephone call. Findings We identified 47 072 eligible contacts (24 825 female, 23 090 male, and 10 542 did not say) who were informed to self-isolate over two periods (period 1 [regional lockdowns in place; no financial support available]: Sept 13, 2020, to Oct 23, 2020 [n=18 568]; period 2 [during a national lockdown; self-isolation support payments available]: Dec 13, 2020, to Jan 16, 2021 [n=28 504]). 10 801 were invited to participate (5092 from period 1, 5709 from period 2); 2027 (188%) completed the survey. People with high income precarity were almost eight times more likely to report financial challenges (adjusted odds ratio 773; 95% CI 510C1174) and three times more likely to report mental health concerns (308; 222C428) than their more financially secure counterparts. Younger people (18C29 years) were twice as likely to report loneliness (196; 137C281) and three times more likely to report mental health concerns (316; 205C486) than individuals aged 60 years and older. Women were nearly twice as likely to experience mental health difficulties as men (151; 120C192). No effects of WIMD were found. Findings were similar between the two periods. Interpretation Financial challenges of self-isolation were particularly acute among those individuals with high income precarity, and younger people and women had considerable mental health challenges. During the pandemic, Welsh Government and local TTP teams used this insight to target financial and mental health support to those with greatest need. Despite easing of self-isolation requirements for contacts of COVID-19 cases, identifying these groups remains important for future pandemics and the provision of financial and social support.

The role of Dot1L against infections was highlighted by an increase of influenza A and vesicular stomatitis virus replication in Dot1L-inhibited cells mediated by a decreased antiviral response. Interferon-beta (IFN-) reporter assays indicate that Dot1L is involved in the control of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein (RIG-I) signaling. Accordingly, Dot1L inhibition decreases the IFN- promoter stimulation and RIG-I- mitochondria-associated viral sensor (RIG-I-MAVS) association upon viral infection. Replication of an influenza A virus lacking NS1 (delNS1), incapable of counteracting the antiviral response, is not affected by Dot1L inhibition. Consequently, RIG-I-MAVS association and nuclear factorCB (NF-B) nuclear translocation, are not affected by the Dot1L inhibition in delNS1 infected cells. Restoration of NS1 expression in trans also reinstated Dot1L as a regulator of the RIG-I-dependent signaling in delNS1 infections. Interferon-inducible E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) expression increases in influenza virus infected cells, but Dot1L inhibition reduces both the TRIM25 expression and TRIM25 protein levels. TRIM25 overexpression reverses the defective innate response mediated by Dot1L inhibition elicited upon virus infection or by overexpression of RIG-I signaling intermediates. Thus, TRIM25 is a control point of the RIG-I recognition pathway controlled by Dot1L and may have a general role in RNA viruses recognized by the RIG-I sensor.","output":"Interferon- Stimulation Elicited by the Influenza Virus Is Regulated by the Histone Methylase Dot1L through the RIG-I-TRIM25 Signaling Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Older adults are stereotyped in a paternalistic manner (warm, but incompetent), deserving of assistance regardless of their need; however, little is known about how gender contextualizes these attitudes. The purpose of this study was to extend previous work that examined the malleability of the paternalistic older adult stereotype using a two-part experimental vignette. The goals of the current study included: (1) to examine attitudes of benevolent ageist behavior toward a male target, (2) to confirm whether attributions made toward an older male target change if they defy or confirm the paternalistic stereotype, and (3) to examine the distinct roles of age and gender on an act of benevolent ageism. Method: In prior work, a female target was offered unnecessary assistance, which is replicated in the current study with a male target. The age (young vs. old), response (accepting vs. declining assistance), and gender (male vs. female) of the target were manipulated and then rated by a young adult sample (N = 698). Results: Our findings replicated earlier work in that overaccommodative behaviors were endorsed more so for the older target than the younger target, which corroborates support for the Stereotype Content Model in that older adults are viewed paternalistically. Additionally, the older male target and the older female target were viewed differently when they respectively defied the paternalistic stereotype indicating distinctness between benevolent ageism and benevolent sexism.

METHODS Two groups of preterm infants (birth weight </= 1500 g) with feeding intolerance were randomized to either low-dose erythromycin (5 mg/kg every 8 hours) or 5% dextrose placebo, both of which were discontinued 1 week after full enteral feedings were tolerated. The primary outcome variable was the time taken to attain full enteral feedings of at least 130 mL/kg/d. RESULTS The gestational age at birth was similar in the two groups (erythromycin, 27.1 +/- 1.9 weeks; placebo, 27.5 +/- 2.9 weeks). The mean birth weight of the erythromycin group was lower (806.3 +/- 215.6 g) than the placebo group (981.4 +/- 285.4 g; P = 0.18), and included more infants who were small for gestational age (4/13 = 31% versus 1/11 = 9%; P = 0.224). There was no difference between the two groups with regard to the volume of feedings they were receiving at the time of enrollment. Reduction in symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux was similar in the two groups. 3 of 13 in the erythromycin group and 4 of 11 in the placebo group improved during the study (P = 0.565). The mean time to attain full enteral feedings after enrollment was 24.9 + 2.9 days in the erythromycin group and 30.8 +/- 4.1 days in the placebo group, a difference that did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS Low-dose erythromycin did not reduce the time taken to attain full enteral feedings in preterm infants with very low birth weight and feeding intolerance. Gastroesophageal reflux decreased as a consequence of maturation of the gastrointestinal tract and not because of erythromycin.

There is a lack of longitudinal studies that can shed light on potential social, emotional, and behavioral development in adolescents. We aimed to identify potential changes in adolescent psychosocial functioning from pre-pandemic to peri-pandemic assessment, and secondly, to identify specific patterns of change. METHODS: This longitudinal study was based on a Lithuanian community sample of 331 adolescents aged 12C16 at T1 (M = 13.87, SD = 1.59). T1 data collected before the pandemic (MarchCJune, 2019) was compared with T2 data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak (October 2020). Psychosocial functioning was assessed by The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Multivariate latent change modeling and latent class change approaches were used to identify patterns of change. RESULTS: We found a small but significant increase in hyperactivity/inattention, emotional symptoms, but also prosocial behavior from before to during the pandemic, even adjusting for resilience, lifetime abuse experience, and socio-demographic situation. Three change profiles were identified in the latent change analysis: (1) a majority (70.7%) experienced a significant increase in psychosocial problems; (2) a smaller sub-group (19.6%) with increased peer problems only; (3) a small group (9.7%) showing no negative change and an increase in prosocial behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The study found a significant negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the majority of adolescents, as well as indications of positive social development in a small group. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and supporting adolescents in the time of the pandemic more effectively.

We report the ability to perform parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy as planned from the preoperative imaging and the type of vascular intervention used to preserve hepatic outflow. METHODS We analyzed 60 consecutive parenchyma-sparing hepatectomies in 54 patients for 7 primary and 53 metastatic tumors (48 colorectal), located in segments I, VII, VIII, or IVa and involving the hepatocaval confluence. Patients had a median of 2 (range: 1-18) lesions with median diameter of 4 cm (range: 1.2-16.5), which were bilateral in 43%. RESULTS A parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy was performed in all of the 60 cases, only one case required the resection of 3 adjacent segments. In 16 (27%) hepatic veins-resections, the outflow was assured by preservation of the inferior-right-hepatic veins in 3 (5%), of the communicating-veins in 4 (7%), of the middle-hepatic veins in 3 (4%; middle-hepatic veins patch-reconstruction in 2 cases), by polytetrafluoroethylene-grafts in 4 (7%), and by hepatic veins-anastomosis in 2 (3%). In 15 (25%) cases, the hepatic veins were resected tangentially and reconstructed by direct suture venorraphy. In 29 (48%) cases, the hepatic veins were skeletonized from the tumor. Grade IIIb to IV complications occurred in 7%, median hospital-stay was 9 days, and 90-day mortality occurred in one cirrhotic patient. Median overall and disease-free survivals were 72 and 16 months (median follow-up: 34 months). CONCLUSION A lesser volume parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy rather than a formal major hepatectomy for tumors involving the hepatocaval confluence can be performed with a low rate of major complications (7%). Parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy should be considered in highly selected patients when evaluating liver resection for tumors involving the hepatocaval confluence based on appropriate and accurate preoperative imaging.","output":"Techniques of parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy for the treatment of tumors involving the hepatocaval confluence: A reliable way to assure an adequate future liver remnant volume."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generalized linear models are flexible tools for the analysis of diverse datasets, but the classical formulation requires that the parametric component is correctly specified and the data contain no atypical observations.

In Brazil, 99% of cases occur in the Amazon region. In the extra-Amazonian region, a non-endemic area, epidemiological surveillance focuses on imported malaria and on autochthonous outbreaks, including cases with mild symptoms and low parasitemia acquired in the Atlantic Forest biome. In this scenario, cases are likely to be underreported, since submicroscopic parasitemias are not detected by thick blood smear, considered the reference test. Molecular tests are more sensitive, detecting asymptomatic individuals and mixed infections. The aim of this study was to propose a more efficient alternative to detect asymptomatic individuals living in areas of low malaria endemicity, as they are reservoirs of Plasmodium that maintain transmission locally. In total, 955 blood samples from residents of 16 municipalities with autochthonous malaria outbreaks in the Sao Paulo State were analyzed; 371 samples were collected in EDTA tubes and 584 in filter paper. All samples were initially screened by a genus-specific qPCR targeting ssrRNA genes (limit of detection of 1 parasite/L). Then, positive samples were subjected to a nested PCR targeting ssrRNA and dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase genes (limit of detection of 10 parasites/L) to determine Plasmodium species. The results showed a statistically significant difference (K = 0.049; p < 0.0001) between microscopy positivity (6.9%) and qPCR (22.9%) for EDTA-blood samples. Conversely, for samples collected in filter paper, no statistical difference was observed, with 2.6% positivity by thick blood smear and 3.1% for qPCR (K = 0.036; p = 0.7). Samples positive by qPCR were assayed by a species-specific nested PCR that was in turn positive in 26% of samples (16 P. vivax and 4 P. malariae ). The results showed that molecular protocols applied to blood samples from residents in areas with autochthonous transmission of malaria were useful to detect asymptomatic patients who act as a source of transmission. The results showed that the genus-specific qPCR was useful for screening positives, with the subsequent identification of species by nested PCR. Additional improvements, such as standardization of blood plotting on filter paper and a more sensitive protocol for species determination, are essential. The qPCR-based algorithm for screening positives followed by nested PCR will contribute to more efficient control of malaria transmission, offering faster and more sensitive tools to detect asymptomatic Plasmodium reservoirs.","output":"An algorithm based on molecular protocols to improve the detection of Plasmodium in autochthonous malarial areas in the Atlantic Forest biome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the persistence of antibody in convalescent COVID-19 patients may help to answer the current major concerns such as the risk of reinfection, the protection period of vaccination and the possibility of building an active herd immunity.

Increasing interest in this approach to perioperative management in children culminated in the recent development of the first enhanced recovery pathway for pediatric intestinal surgery, endorsed by Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Society (ERAS ?). In parallel, there has been increasing interest in the refinement of perioperative management of selected pediatric cardiac surgical patients, invariably referred to as 'fast track' management. Initiatives have largely focused on duration of post-operative ventilation rather than on a much wider range of perioperative interventions to optimize recovery and ensure timely discharge after surgery. In our institution, a 'Level 1' pediatric cardiac surgical center, we assembled a multidisciplinary team to design a comprehensive enhanced recovery pathway, based on ERAS? methodology, for selected cardiac surgical patients. After a lengthy period of planning, staff education and preparation we implemented the pathway at the end of November 2019. METHODS We conducted a prospective audit of the perioperative management and outcomes of the first 88 patients managed according to this enhanced recovery pathway over a 25 month period in our institution. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 5.8 years (range 0.5 to 17.9) and the mean weight was 22.4 kg (range 6.6 to 57.2). 68 of the 88 were cardiopulmonary bypass cases. 54% of patients received all four defined intraoperative anesthetic interventions (intravenous paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, antiemetic if aged more than 4 years and use of a local anesthetic technique). 89% of patients met the target extubation time of six hours after administration of protamine. Median postoperative intensive care unit length of stay was 23.5hours (range 15.2 to 89.5). When compared to a historic control group this represented a 22% reduction in median Intensive Care Unit stay, although the total hospital length of stay remained unchanged. 83% of patients met the target hospital discharge target of the fifth postoperative day.

This results in the death of muscle cells and cardiomyocytes and consequent substitution by fat and fibrous tissue. The clinical translation of this is muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. We report on the case of a young patient with dilated cardiomyopathy on a background of DMD who developed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). CASE SUMMARY: A 19-year-old male patient with DMD, known dilated cardiomyopathy, and no risk factors for ischaemic heart disease presented with central crushing chest pain. His electrocardiogram revealed anterior ST elevation. His angiogram revealed distally occluded left anterior descending and second diagonal branch with no evidence of underlying coronary artery disease. He was treated with balloon angioplasty. An echocardiogram raised the suspicion of a left ventricular thrombus, and the mechanism of STEMI was felt to be embolism from the left ventricular thrombus on a background of dilated cardiomyopathy in the context of DMD. The patient was treated with anticoagulants (warfarin). On a repeat echocardiogram a few months later, the thrombus had resolved. At 3 years of follow-up, the patient did not present any more embolic events. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of STEMI secondary to thrombotic coronary occlusion that has been described in a patient with DMD. This case highlights an unusual complication of DMD. Based on this case, we discuss the dilemmas in the management and follow-up of this complex patient population.","output":"ST-elevation myocardial infarction in a young patient with Duchennes muscular dystrophy: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a Human Counting system is implemented for COVID-19 capacity restrictions.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to review published studies implementing AAIs in hospital settings and to assess the effects of AAIs on the biobehavioral response to stress and pain, social behavior, quality of life and level of satisfaction with hospitalization in children and adolescents. Stress and burden, quality of life, mood and level of satisfaction with hospitalization in parents/caregivers as well as stress and burden, perception of the work environment and job satisfaction in hospital staff were also reviewed. METHODS: All published studies reporting quantitative assessments were systematically searched using PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest and Web of Science databases in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The aim was to identify studies examining the effects of AAIs on behavioral, psychological and physiological responses to stress in children and adolescents (0C18 years) formally admitted to a hospital for a stay, as well as in those undergoing a visit for treatments or medical examinations. RESULTS: Of the 350 studies screened, 21 were eligible for inclusion. Most of them focused on stress, pain, and anxiety reduction in pediatric patients, and used both physiological parameters and behavioral and psychological observations/scales. All studies employed dogs. Results show the potential of AAIs to reduce anxiety and behavioral distress in pediatric patients while acting on physiological measures associated with arousal. CONCLUSION: Although further, more rigorous studies are still needed, the findings of this review may have implications for clinical practices suggesting appropriate planning of AAIs by pediatric healthcare professionals.

In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. MATERIALS AND METHODS The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. RESULTS The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","output":"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on a sample of Spanish health professionals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A comprehensive approach to decisions about the use of land and other world resources, taking full account of biological and other scientific information, is crucial for good decisions to be made now and in future. The sustainability of systems for producing food and other products is sometimes assessed using too narrow a range of component factors. A production system might be unsustainable because of adverse effects on a wide range of aspects of human welfare, animal welfare, or the environment. All factors should be included in sustainability evaluation, otherwise products or actions might be avoided without adequate consideration of key factors or of the diversity of production systems. A scoring method that is based on scientific information and potentially of general relevance is presented here, using beef production as a example with a review of each of its sustainability components. This includes an overall combined score and specific factors that make the system unacceptable for some consumers. The results show that, in this example, the sustainability of the best systems is very much better than that of the worst systems. By taking account of scores for a wide range of components of sustainability in comparing beef-production systems, better quality policies about beef use can be formulated than when statements referring only to one system are considered. The least sustainable beef-production systems are extensive grazing that causes land degradation and the use of feedlots or indoor housing with grain feeding. Semi-intensive silvopastoral systems are the most sustainable beef-production systems, and well-managed pasture-fed beef from areas where crop production is uneconomic is also sustainable. This simple, scientifically based scoring system could be modified to use positive as well as negative scores and is of value for policy makers, researchers, producers, organisations aiming to improve sustainability, and the general public.","output":"A method for assessing sustainability, with beef production as an example."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It seems important to understand how was the life of young people during the Antiquity, in the Greek cities and in Rome. Furthermore, it can be useful to find if there is a stage that marks the transition to adulthood. Finally, as the Romans are considerate to be great codifiers of laws, it seems important to study the Roman law to understand the legal conception of adolescence at this period. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A literature review has been done about studies published between 1962 and 2015. Those publications were found in some historical databases (as Perse, Cairns, J-Stor, OpenEdition) and in academic libraries. RESULTS In the Greek cities, the adolescent, at 18 years old, has to do a military service called the ephebia. At the end of this formation, the young man, aged of 20 years old, comes back to his city. However, he has to continue his (intellectual) training until about his 30 years old. Generally, at this age, a man marries a young girl and becomes a respected adult. In the Roman law, there is no conception of legal age for the majority: the young people stay under the authority of the pater familias (father of the family) until the death of the father. If the father is dead: the boy becomes a pupil and has a specific juridical status until his 25 years. Two important stages exist for the young Romans: wearing the toga virilis (toga of manhood) and the wedding. CONCLUSIONS There is an evolution in the perception of the adolescence during the Antiquity: for the Greeks, the adolescence ends at 20 years old with an important stage, the ephebia. In the Roman law, there is no legal age because everyone lives under the authority of the pater familias.","output":"Adolescence during Antiquity: the Greek and Roman periods."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM: There is a paucity of guidance regarding implementation of telemedicine curricula at the clerkship level, particularly with students actively engaged in video and telephone encounters. The COVID-19 pandemic caused rapid shifts in the delivery of medical education to clerkship-level students. This article describes the successful pilot of a direct patient care, virtual health curriculum at the clerkship level and discusses lessons learned. APPROACH: All 18 preceptors and 5 students at Stanford University School of Medicine, California, enrolled in the required 4-week family medicine clerkship in April 2020 were connected as virtual partners via a commercial video platform. The combined use of both this video program and Epic electronic health record (EHR) software as modes for teaching and patient care led to technical challenges and logistical hurdles. As part of an iterative process, clerkship leadership identified problems via preceptor and student interviews and integrated that feedback to create a model for delivering high-quality, clerkship-level clinical instruction during the COVID-19 shelter in place order. OUTCOMES: Of those who completed an evaluation, the majority of preceptors (n = 16; 89%) and students (n = 4; 100%, 1 student did not respond) expressed satisfaction with the virtual, remote teaching model conducted over 37 clinic visits. A detailed 14-step process list resulted from identifying and addressing both audio and video technical challenges and is provided for use by other institutions that wish to implement this workflow.

This report assessed current practices and focused solely on cryopreserved HSPC cell therapy products to establish preliminary recommendations for a stability program roadmap. METHODS A survey was prepared by the SPT and distributed to ISCT and AABB members. Survey results were summarized and recommendations were outlined based on the responses from the survey. This report highlights current practices for cryopreserved HSPC stability programs, including additional considerations and recommendations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Eighty-two (82) centers worldwide participated in the survey. Survey results indicate variability across programs. HSPC stability depends on multiple factors within the processing facility (e.g., cryopreservation techniques, reagents used, and storage temperature) and independent variables (e.g., donor-related factors and starting material variability). While retention of hematopoietic engraftment potential is the primary goal for cryopreserved HSPC stability, engraftment results should not be used as the sole metric for stability programs. Based on the survey results, the SPT provides recommendations for consideration. CONCLUSIONS The SPT recommendations for best practices are not intended to replace existing standards.

METHODS: The levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were determined by flow cytometry in 27 COVID-19 patients, and their association with clinical characteristics and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: The frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs was elevated in COVID-19 patients, particularly severe patients. A follow-up comparison revealed a decline of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs percentages in most patients 1 day after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were still greater than 50.0% in 3 ICU patients 4-10 days after negative SARS-CoV-2 results. Elevated frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs was positively correlated with oropharyngeal viral loads and length of hospital stay, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte counts and serum albumin. Moreover, strong correlations were observed between the frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs and T cell subsets, NK cell counts, and B cell percentages. The frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs could be used as a predictor of COVID-19 severity.

Although influenza viral infections are usually diagnosed using viral isolation and serological/molecular analyses, the cost, accessibility, and availability of these methods may limit their utility in various settings. The objective of this study was to develop and optimized a multiplex detection system for most influenza viruses currently infecting humans. METHODS: We developed and optimized a multiplex detection system for most influenza viruses currently infecting humans including two type B (both Victoria lineages and Yamagata lineages), H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9 using Reverse Transcriptional Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) technology coupled with a one-pot colorimetric visualization system to facilitate direct determination of results without additional steps. We also evaluated this multiplex RT-LAMP for clinical use using a total of 135 clinical and spiked samples (91 influenza viruses and 44 other human infectious viruses). RESULTS: We achieved rapid detection of seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and Type B) and avian influenza viruses (H5N1, H5N6, H5N8 and H7N9) within an hour. The assay could detect influenza viruses with high sensitivity (i.e., from 100 to 0.1 viral genome copies), comparable to conventional RT-PCR-based approaches which would typically take several hours and require expensive equipment. This assay was capable of specifically detecting each influenza virus (Type B, H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8 and H7N9) without cross-reactivity with other subtypes of AIVs or other human infectious viruses. Furthermore, 91 clinical and spiked samples confirmed by qRT-PCR were also detected by this multiplex RT-LAMP with 98.9% agreement. It was more sensitive than one-step RT-PCR approach (92.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that our multiplex RT-LAMP assay may provide a rapid, sensitive, cost-effective, and reliable diagnostic method for identifying recent influenza viruses infecting humans, especially in locations without access to large platforms or sophisticated equipment.

However, a number of limitations (e.g., low NIR absorption capacity of photothermal agents, insufficient loading efficiency of photosensitive molecules) have hindered the widespread use of NIR-mediated cancer therapy. Therefore, we developed a mesoporous silica-coated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite that could provide a high encapsulation rate of indocyanine green (ICG) and enhance PTT/PDT efficiency in vitro and in vivo. The ICG-encapsulated nanocomposite not only enhances the photothermal effect but also generates a large number of tumor toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). By conjugation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with folic acid (FA) as a tumor targeting moiety, we confirmed that ICG-encapsulated mesoporous silica (MS)-coated rGO nanocomposite (ICG@MS-rGO-FA) exhibited high colloidal stability and intracellular uptake in folate receptor-expressing CT-26 colorectal cancer cells. Upon NIR laser irradiation, this ICG@MS-rGO-FA nanocomposite induced the apoptosis of only CT-26 cells via enhanced PTT and PDT effects without any damage to normal cells. Furthermore, the ICG@MS-rGO-FA nanocomposite revealed satisfactory tumor targeting and biocompatibility in CT-26 tumor-bearing mice, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effects of PTT and PDT in vivo.

This makes the efficient production and recycling of lithium an issue that should be addressed immediately. Lithium bromide is widely used as a water-absorbent material, a humidity regulator, and an absorption refrigerant in the industry. However, there are few studies on the recovery of lithium from lithium bromide after disposal. In this paper, a bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) process is proposed to convert waste lithium bromide into lithium hydroxide, with the generation of valuable hydrobromic acid as a by-product. The effects of the current density, the feed salt concentration, and the initial salt chamber volume on the performance of the BMED process were studied. When the reaction conditions were optimized, it was concluded that an initial salt chamber volume of 200 mL and a salt concentration of 0.3 mol/L provided the maximum benefit. A high current density leads to high energy consumption but with high current efficiency; therefore, the optimum current density was identified as 30 mA/cm(2). Under the optimized conditions, the total economic cost of the BMED process was calculated as 2.243 USDkg(?1)LiOH. As well as solving the problem of recycling waste lithium bromide, the process also represents a novel production methodology for lithium hydroxide.

The rate of viral suppression among those in care increased to 85% in 2018, highlighting the need to ensure sustained care for people with HIV. Greater increases in all steps along the HIV care continuum are needed for those disproportionately impacted by HIV, especially the young, sexual and racial/ethnic minorities, people experiencing homelessness, and people who inject drugs. Informed by systematic reviews and current research findings, this paper describes more recent promising practices that suggest an impact on HIV care outcomes. It highlights rapid linkage and treatment interventions; interventions that identify and re-engage people in HIV care through new collaborations among health departments, providers, and hospital systems; coordinated care and low-barrier clinic models; and telemedicine-delivered HIV care approaches. The interventions presented in this paper provide additional approaches that state and local jurisdictions can use to reach their local HIV elimination plans' goals and the ambitious Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. Treat pillar targets by 2030.","output":"The HIV Treat Pillar: An Update and Summary of Promising Approaches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary discussed the psychological issues related to bereavement in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Viable particles are living microorganisms, whereas non-viable particles do not contain microorganisms but act as transport for viable particles. The effectiveness of ozone in reducing these particles in a non-controlled room and a controlled cleanroom using high-efficiency particles air (HEPA) filter was analyzed in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Viable particles and non-viable particles sized 0.5 and 5 m were quantified before and after ozonation in two different health environments: non-controlled (group 1) and controlled area, which was associated with a HEPA filtering system (group 2). Active air sampling using a MAS 100 was used to count the number of viable particles, while the number of non-viable particles/m3 was obtained following the manufacturer's recommendations of the Lasair III 310C system. RESULTS Our results of the viable particles counting were not quantifiable and analyzed using statistical tests. Both groups showed a slight tendency to reduce the number of viable particles after ozonation of the environmental air. A statistically significant reduction of non-viable 5 m particles after ozonation was observed in both groups (G1: p = 0,009; G2: p = 0,002). Reduction in the non-viable 0.5 m particles after ozonation was observed only in group 2, associated with the HEPA filter. In group 1, after ozonation, a significant increase in 0.5 m particles was observed, probably due to the breaking of 5 m particles by ozone gas. Our results suggest that ozone gas can break 5 m particles and, when associated with a HEPA filter, increases its effectiveness in removing 0.5 m particles. CONCLUSION Considering that 5 m particles are important in the air transport of microorganisms, their reduction in the environment can be a relevant parameter in controlling the dissemination of infections.","output":"Effect of Ozone Gas on Removal of Airborne Particles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Faraday Discussion volume is unique in the hundred plus year history of the Faraday Discussion series, being produced at a time of unprecedented circumstances worldwide and without the preceding Faraday Discussion conference having taken place.","output":"Luminescent silicon nanostructures and COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Research Question How have U.S. states incorporated the controversial standard of rationing by age and/or life-years into their pandemic preparedness plans? Study Design and Methods Investigator-initiated, textual analysis conducted from AprilCJune 2020, querying online resources and in-state contacts to identify PPPs published by each of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Analysis included the most recent versions of CSC documents and official state PPPs containing triage guidance as of June 2020. Plans were categorized as rationing by (A) short-term survival (<1 year), (B) 1-5 expected life-years, (C) total life-years, (D) fair innings, i.e., specific age cut-offs, or (O) other. The primary measure was any use of age and/or life-years. Plans were further categorized based on whether age/life-years was a primary consideration. Results 35 states promulgated PPPs addressing the rationing of critical care resources. Seven states considered short-term prognosis, seven considered whether a patient had 1-5 expected life-years, thirteen rationed by total life-years, and one used the fair innings principle. Seven states provided only general ethical considerations. Seventeen of the twenty-one plans considering age/life-years made it a primary consideration. Several plans borrowed heavily from a few common sources, though use of terminology was inconsistent. Many documents were modified in light of controversy. Interpretation Guidance with respect to rationing by age and/or life-years varied widely. Over half of PPPs, many following a few common models, included age/life-years as an explicit rationing criterion; the majority of these made it a primary consideration. Terminology was often vague, and many plans evolved in response to pushback.

However, consistency between the reported number of COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause deaths was limited across prefectures, suggesting the necessity of distinguishing the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 by cause-specific analysis. To examine whether deaths from road injuries decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, consistent with a possible reduction of road transport activity connected to Japans state of emergency declaration, we estimated the exiguous deaths from road injuries in each week from January to September 2020 by 47 prefectures. METHODS: To estimate the expected weekly number of deaths from road injuries, a quasi-Poisson regression was applied to daily traffic fatalities data obtained from Traffic Accident Research and Data Analysis, Japan. We set two thresholds, point estimate and lower bound of the two-sided 95% prediction interval, for exiguous deaths, and report the range of differences between the observed number of deaths and each of these thresholds as exiguous deaths. RESULTS: Since January 2020, in a few weeks the observed deaths from road injuries fell below the 95% lower bound, such as April 6C12 (exiguous deaths 5C21, percent deficit 2.82C38.14), May 4C10 (8C23, 21.05C43.01), July 20C26 (12C29, 30.77C51.53), and August 3C9 (3C20, 7.32C34.41). However, those less than the 95% lower bound were also observed in weeks in the previous years. CONCLUSIONS: The number of road traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan has decreased slightly, but not significantly, in several weeks compared with the average year. This suggests that the relatively small changes in excess all-cause mortality observed in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic could not be explained simply by an offsetting reduction in traffic deaths. Considering a variety of other indirect effects, evaluating an independent, unbiased measure of COVID-19-related mortality burden could provide insight into the design of future broad-based infectious disease counter-measures and offer lessons to other countries.

METHODS: An online questionnaire survey was conducted in July 2020. The two questionnaires covered 35 and 8 questions about non-pregnancy and pregnancy clinical practice for overt hyperthyroidism, respectively. RESULTS: One thousand, two hundred fifty-six physicians participated. Chief physicians and associate chief physicians accounted for 58.6% of the participants. Approximately 95.2% of the respondents chose the thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) test to clarify the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, while only 27.0% of them chose radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU). In terms of treatment for non-pregnant patients, anti-thyroid drugs (ATDs) were the first choice, and most of the clinicians chose methimazole. Compared with clinicians in recent studies, Chinese physicians used serum TRAb to diagnose Graves disease more commonly, and there were obviously more physicians preferring ATDs. For maternal hyperthyroidism, most physicians preferred propylthiouracil administration before or during the first trimester, which is consistent with the 2016 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines. In terms of the initial ATD dose, monitoring the treatment process, indications for ATD withdrawal and treatment of special cases, the preferences of Chinese physicians were generally consistent with the guidelines.

Many field experiments have observed large sensitivity of leaf C:N ratio to eCO2 and iNDEP. However, the large-scale pattern of this sensitivity is still unclear, because eCO2 and iNDEP drive leaf C:N ratio toward opposite directions, which are further compounded by the complex processes of nitrogen acquisition and plant-and-microbial nitrogen competition. Here, we attempt to map the leaf C:N ratio spatial variation in the past 5 decades in China with a combination of data-driven model and process-based modeling. These two approaches showed consistent results. Over different regions, we found that leaf C:N ratio had significant but uneven changes between 2 time periods (1960-1989 and 1990-2015): a 5%  8% increase for temperate grasslands in northern China, a 3%  6% increase for boreal grasslands in western China, and by contrast, a 7%  6% decrease for temperate forests in southern China, and a 3%  5% decrease for boreal forests in northeastern China. Additionally, the structural equation models indicated that the leaf C:N change was sensitive to NDEP, CO2 and MAT rather than MAP and ecosystem types. Process-based modeling suggested that iNDEP was the main source of soil mineral nitrogen change, dominating leaf C:N ratio change in most areas in China, while eCO2 led to leaf C:N ratio increase in low iNDEP area. This study also indicates that the long-term leaf C:N ratio acclimation was dominated by climate constraint, especially temperature, but was constrained by soil N availability over decade scale.","output":"Long-term leaf C:N ratio change under elevated CO2 and nitrogen deposition in China: Evidence from observations and process-based modeling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES A feasibility study.

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. RESULTS: We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period. Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.

METHODS A total of 125 continuous patients were randomly assigned to receive either CO2 (n = 63) or air (n = 62) insufflation during propofol-sedated colonoscopy. Postcolonoscopy abdominal pain, distention, and satisfaction were assessed at 1, 3, and 24 h after the procedure, and the proportions of pain-free and distention-free patients were compared. Residual bowel gas in the colon and small bowel was evaluated at 1 h after colonoscopy. End-tidal CO2 and O2 saturation was measured for safety analysis. RESULTS There was a significant difference between the two groups regarding the postcolonoscopy abdominal pain, distention, and subjective satisfaction at 1 h (P < 0.001) and 3 h (P < 0.01) after the procedure.

Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a major cause of death among HIV-infected patients. Cryptococcal antigenemia (CrAg+) in the absence of CM can represent early-stage cryptococcosis during which antifungal treatment might improve outcomes. However, patients without meningitis are rarely tested for cryptococcal infection. We evaluated Cryptococcus species as a cause of acute respiratory infection in hospitalized patients in Thailand and evaluated clinical characteristics associated with CrAg+. Methods. We tested banked serum samples from 704 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)Cinfected and 730 HIV-uninfected patients hospitalized with acute respiratory infection from 2004 through 2009 in 2 rural provinces in Thailand for the presence of CrAg+. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted for CrAg+ patients to distinguish meningeal and nonmeningeal cryptococcosis and to identify clinical characteristics associated with CrAg+ in patients with and without evidence of CM. Results. CrAg+ was found in 92 HIV-infected patients (13.1%); only tuberculosis (19.3%) and rhinovirus (16.5%) were identified more frequently. No HIV-uninfected patients were CrAg+. Of 70 CrAg+ patients with medical charts available, 37 (52.9%) had no evidence of past or existing CM at hospitalization; 30 of those patients (42.9% of all CrAg+) had neither past nor existing CM, nor any alternate etiology of infection identified. Dyspnea was more frequent among CrAg+ patients without CM than among CrAgC patients (P = .0002). Conclusions. Cryptococcus species were the most common pathogens detected in HIV-infected patients hospitalized with acute respiratory infection in Thailand.

Importantly, more noteworthy coagulation disorders similar to the differences between patients and controls were found in the aggravated patients with conditions deterioration after admission than those in the nonaggravated patients without conditions deterioration (P < .05). Moreover, the aggravated patients possessed a longer hospital stay and a higher mortality compared with the nonaggravated patients (P < .001). The coagulation parameters of COVID-19 patients were widely and closely related to the indexes of liver function and inflammation (P < .05), indicating the coagulation dysfunction of these patients may be caused by liver injury and inflammatory storm. CONCLUSION: Severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection often possess coagulation dysfunction on admission. A certain correlation exists in coagulation disorder and adverse clinical outcome among severe COVID-19 patients.","output":"Manifestations of blood coagulation and its relation to clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients: Retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early and precocious determination of acute kidney injury (AKI) is essential to prevent morbidity and mortality following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Evaluation of the perioperative renal function is substantial using novel biomarkers other than the late traditional method of using serum creatinine. Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a biomarker investigated for early detection of AKI in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and its role has to be determined in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients undergoing elective CABG were enrolled in this cohort study and were assigned into two groups: group I include the patients that did not develop AKI (no AKI group) and group II include the patients that developed AKI (AKI group). Acute kidney injury based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification had been developed in 7 patients (28%). Plasma NGAL levels at 6 h were higher in patients who developed AKI compared with those who did not (302  88.02 vs. 116.50  17.33 ng/m, p value < 0.001). The cut-off value of plasma NGAL levels measured 6 h postoperatively was 145 ng/ml and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.965. Results of this study showed that plasma NGAL is a robust early biomarker of AKI, which preceded the rise in serum creatinine by many hours. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that earlier diagnosis of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing CABG can be achieved by measuring postoperative plasma NGAL concentration at 6 h.","output":"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as a biomarker for predicting acute kidney injury after coronary artery bypass grafting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Summer camp can positively affect self-esteem and social skills.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the association between ABO blood groups and the presentation and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective cohort study of patients with mild-to-moderately severe COVID-19 infections who presented in the COVID-19 unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital and were enrolled between 01 June and 25 August, 2020. Patients were followed up for at least 30 days after disease onset. We grouped participants with A-positive and A-negative blood groups into group I and participants with other blood groups into group II. RESULTS: The cohort included 438 patients; 52 patients were lost to follow-up, five died, and 381 completed the study. The prevalence of blood group A [144 (32.9%)] was significantly higher among COVID-19 patients than in the general population (p < 0.001). The presenting age [mean (SD)] of group I [42.1 (14.5)] was higher than that of group II [38.8 (12.4), p = 0.014]. Sex (p = 0.23) and co-morbidity (hypertension, p = 0.34; diabetes, p = 0.13) did not differ between the patients in groups I and II. No differences were observed regarding important presenting symptoms, including fever (p = 0.72), cough (p = 0.69), and respiratory distress (p = 0.09). There was no significant difference in the median duration of symptoms in the two group (12 days), and conversion to the next level of severity was observed in 26 (20.6%) and 36 patients (13.8%) in group I and II, respectively. However, persistent positivity of RT-PCR at 14 days of initial positivity was more frequent among the patients in group I [24 (19%)] than among those in group II [29 (11.1%)].

Improved rapid diagnosis and antimicrobial resistance determination, such as by whole genome sequencing, are required. Our aim was to develop a simple, low-cost method of preparing DNA for sequencing direct from MTB positive clinical samples (without culture). Simultaneous sputum liquefaction, bacteria heat-inactivation (99C/30min) and enrichment for Mycobacteria DNA was achieved using an equal volume of thermo-protection buffer (4M KCl, 0.05M HEPES buffer pH7.5, 0.1% DTT). The buffer emulated intracellular conditions found in hyperthermophiles, thus protecting DNA from rapid thermo-degradation, which renders it a poor template for sequencing. Initial validation experiments employed Mycobacteria DNA, either extracted or intracellular. Next, mock clinical samples (infection-negative human sputum spiked 0-105 BCG cells/ml) underwent liquefaction in thermo-protection buffer and heat-inactivation. DNA was extracted and sequenced. Human DNA degraded faster than Mycobacteria DNA, resulting in target enrichment. Four replicate experiments achieved MTB detection at 101 BCG cells/ml, with 31-59 MTB complex reads. Maximal genome coverage (>97% at 5x-depth) occurred at 104 BCG cells/ml; >91% coverage (1x depth) at 103 BCG cells/ml.

Both initial (r = 0.58, 0.64, p < 0.05) and worst CT scores (r = 0.47, 0.65, p < 0.05) were correlated with C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase; and CT scores before discharge, only with albumin (r = -0.41, p < 0.05). Duration to worst CT manifestation was associated with initial and worst CT scores (r = 0.33, 0.29, p < 0.05). No parameters were related to timespan to discharge. Conclusion: Our results illustrated the temporal changes of characteristic clinical measures and extent of CT lung abnormalities in COVID-19.

In the current study, a novel \\"symptomics\\" approach was employed to examine the association between acute transdiagnostic symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and burnout and work and relationship difficulties in FHCWs at an urban tertiary care hospital in New York City. METHODS Symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD (4-item PTSD Checklist-5), MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), burnout (Single-Item Mini-Z Burnout Assessment), and functional difficulties (Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning) were assessed. Relative importance analyses were conducted to identify PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms associated with burnout and functional difficulties. RESULTS The total number of eligible participants included 6,026 presumed FHCWs, of which 3,360 (55.8%) completed the survey and 2,579 (76.8%) of whom endorsed directly treating patients with COVID-19 and provided sufficient responses to our outcome variables for analysis. Feeling tired/having little energy, being easily annoyed or irritable, and feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge were most strongly associated with burnout; feeling tired/having little energy accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 15%). Negative expectations of oneself or the world, trouble concentrating, and feeling easily annoyed or irritable were most strongly associated with work difficulties; negative expectations of oneself or the world accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 9%). Feeling easily annoyed or irritable, negative expectations about oneself or the world, and feeling bad about oneself were most strongly associated with relationship difficulties; feeling easily annoyed or irritable accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (> 10%). CONCLUSIONS Results of this study underscore the importance of a transdiagnostic, symptom-based approach when examining associations between acute psychopathology and burnout and functional difficulties in FHCWs. Further work is needed to determine if early interventions aimed at ameliorating specific psychiatric symptoms may help mitigate risk for peri- and posttraumatic burnout and functional difficulties in this population.","output":"Transdiagnostic Psychiatric Symptoms, Burnout, and Functioning in Frontline Health Care Workers Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Symptomics Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19) has recently raised worldwide public health concerns.

Recent evidence shows internet-delivered dialectic behaviour therapy (iDBT) skills training can reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity. However, further studies are needed to provide more definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of iDBT skills training in the chronic pain population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-case experimental design (SCED) with multiple baselines will be used to examine the efficacy of a 4-week iDBT-Pain skills training intervention (iDBT-Pain intervention) to reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity in individuals with chronic pain. The iDBT-Pain intervention encompasses two components: (1) iDBT-Pain skills training sessions (iDBT-Pain sessions) and (2) the iDBT-Pain skills training web application (iDBT-Pain app). Three individuals with chronic pain will be recruited and randomly allocated to different baseline phases (5, 9 or 12 days). Following the baseline phase, participants will receive six 60-90 min iDBT-Pain sessions approximately 4 or 5 days apart, delivered by a psychologist via Zoom. To reinforce learnings from the iDBT-Pain sessions, participants will have unlimited use of the iDBT-Pain app. A 7-day follow-up phase (maintenance) will follow the intervention, whereby the iDBT-Pain sessions cease but the iDBT-Pain app is accessible. Emotional regulation, as the primary outcome measure, will be assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Pain intensity, as the secondary outcome measure, will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Generalisation measures will assess psychological state factors (depression, anxiety and coping behaviour), alongside sleep quality, well-being and harm avoidance. SCEDs are increasingly considered effective designs for internet-delivered psychological interventions because SCED enables the investigation of interindividual variability in a heterogeneous population such as chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Patients in cardiogenic shock with severe MR have a poor prognosis in the setting of conventional medical therapy. Because of its favorable safety profile, TMVr is being increasingly used as an acute therapy in this population, though its efficacy remains unknown. METHODS: A multicenter, collaborative, patient-level analysis was conducted. Patients with cardiogenic shock and moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR who were not surgical candidates were treated with TMVr. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and the combined event rate of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization following dichotomization by TMVr device success. RESULTS: Between January 2011 and February 2019, 141 patients across 14 institutions met the inclusion criteria. In-hospital mortality occurred in 22 patients (15.6%), at 90 days in 38 patients (29.5%), and at one year in 55 patients (42.6%). Median length of hospital stay following TMVr was 10 days (interquartile range: 6 to 20 days). HF hospitalization occurred in 26 patients (18.4%) at a median of 73 days (interquartile range: 26 to 546 days). When stratified by TMVr procedural results, successful TMVr reduced rates of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13 to 0.98; p = 0.04), 90-day mortality (HR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.78; p = 0.01), and the composite of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.90; p = 0.03).

This may result in unnecessary antibiotic therapy. This analysis described the experience of an urban academic medical centers management of non-ICU patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the initial months of the pandemic and assessed the rate of concomitant bacterial pneumonia in this population. METHODS: This retrospective analysis evaluated patients 18 years and older admitted to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH) between March 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020 who had a positive COVID-19 test, were symptomatic, and received at least one dose of antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy was considered appropriate if there was objective evidence of bacterial pneumonia. Per the TJUH COVID-19 guidelines, objective diagnostic criteria assessed included the following: MRSA nasopharyngeal swab, urine Legionella pneumophilia or Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test, respiratory pathogen panel, and sputum culture. If patients did not have evidence of bacterial pneumonia, the threshold for appropriate discontinuation of antibiotics was 48 hours. RESULTS: 50 patients were included in the final analysis. Upon admission, 7 (14%) patients had clear chest radiographs, and 9 (25%) of the 36 patients with a procalcitonin drawn had a level  0.25, indicating a potential bacterial infection. 15 (30%) patients were known to be COVID-19 positive prior to being administered antibiotics. Additionally, 22 (44%) patients had an infectious diseases service consult during their admission. 25 (50%) patients were continued on antibiotics > 48 hours. The mean duration of antibiotic therapy in the entire population was 3.4 days (82 hours). The monthly average duration of antibiotic therapy trended downward as the pandemic progressed. The most common empiric antibiotic regimen was ceftriaxone and azithromycin, received by 28 (56%) patients. Only 2 (4%) patients were diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. CONCLUSION: In a sample of 50 COVID patients the overall rate of concomitant bacterial pneumonia was 4%. Given this finding, it is vital to remain judicious with the use of antibiotics and to employ the assistance of antimicrobial stewardship colleagues when managing patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Unfortunately, there are little data available on adolescents and young adults who have contracted HIV. Only few studies have been conducted in India with an aim to assess the clinical presentation, disease progression, and clinical profile of HIV in adolescents. Materials and Methods There was a cohort study conducted at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) center at a teaching hospital in Western India. The study participants were kept under observation for 1 year. The end point of the cohort analysis was HIV disease progression. Patient details such as sociodemographic profile, CD4 counts at presentation, date of initiation of ART, WHO clinical stage of HIV at presentation, episodes of opportunistic infections, and laboratory investigations were recorded. Descriptive statistics and survival analysis were used for analyzing disease progression, improvement in health conditions, and factors affecting the same. Results Of 155 participants, 100 were followed up till the end of the study. Seventy-two percent participants were adolescents and 53% were female.

Vaping is also a risk factor for and is implicated in the spreading of COVID-19. Despite the consequences of vaping, the views and training of medical students regarding vaping is unclear. This study sought to investigate the knowledge and perception of vaping amongst future health care providers. Methods An anonymous, online survey was administered to 259 first through fourth year medical students at Nova Southeastern University Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine via a secure website link in October 2019 and January 2020. The survey consisted of two sections. All participants answered section one, involving nine questions. This first section addressed sociodemographic characteristics, personal views on vaping, rating and impact of vaping medical education, and whether students had ever tried vaping. If students had ever vaped, they proceeded to section two of the survey including nine additional questions. Students that reported no past vaping use ended the survey and did not proceed to section two. Section two focused on evaluating vaping habits of users by questioning age of first usage, use frequency and nature, reasons for first trying and/or continuing to use, plans for quitting, personal impact of use, and current use. Data was analyzed with frequency and percentage distributions. Results Most respondents were of age 18-25 years (66.8%) and female (60.2%). Almost all students (96.5%) were aware of the negative health consequences of vaping. More than two thirds of students (68.7%) rated their vaping medical education as inadequate and the majority (76.1%) indicated their medical school curriculum did not impact their view on the matter. Most students (71.0%) reported a more negative stance on vaping due to recent news and media. Of the respondents, over two thirds (37.5%) vaped at least once and were labeled vapers. The most commonly stated reason for first trying vaping was recreational (60.8%). Half of vapers (50.5%) admitted to vaping in the past year and most vapers (90.6%) did not think their vaping impacted others. Current vaping use was reported in almost one-third of vapers (32.3%) despite knowing its dangers, and several (6.3%) did not consider vaping dangerous. Conclusion The findings from this pilot study conducted at a single medical school indicate possible deficiencies in vaping education, at least as perceived by the respondents and demonstrated by their vaping-related actions. It is unknown if the stated vaping views and practices of these medical students would be positively impacted by better vaping education or if these practices are generalizable to other students. However, the data suggests there is a need to consider more extensive analyses of medical school curriculums with respect to vaping education and training of students in these and related areas. Recommendations to enhance medical school curriculums include vaping-focused respiratory and gastrointestinal lectures, problem-based case studies on vaping, standardized patient encounters, and a community education program taught by medical students.","output":"Assessing Vaping Views, Usage, and Vaping-Related Education Among Medical Students: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We aimed to investgate the chest high-resoluton computed tomography (HRCT) imaging manifestatons of patents with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.

Usage of PAPRs by healthcare workers is rapidly increasing; these respirators are often considered the best option in healthcare settings, particularly during public health emergency situations, such as outbreaks of pandemic diseases. At the same time, lack of user training and certain vigorous work activities may lead to a decrease in a respirator's performance. There is a critical need for real-time performance monitoring of respiratory protective devices, including PAPRs. In this effort, a new robust and low-cost real-time performance monitor (RePM) capable of evaluating the protection offered by a PAPR against aerosol particles at a workplace was developed. The new device was evaluated on a manikin and on human subjects against a pair of condensation nuclei counters (P-Trak) used as the reference protection measurement system. The outcome was expressed as a manikin-based protection factor (mPF) and a Simulated Workplace Protection Factor (SWPF) determined while testing on subjects. For the manikin-based testing, the data points collected by the two methods were plotted against each other; a near-perfect correlation was observed with a correlation coefficient of 0.997. This high correlation is particularly remarkable since RePM and condensation particle counter (CPC) measure in different particle size ranges. The data variability increased with increasing mPF. The evaluation on human subjects demonstrated that RePM prototype provided an excellent Sensitivity (96.3% measured on human subjects at a response time of 60 sec) and a Specificity of 100%.

We find that after a loss of average life satisfaction during the first three months after the outbreak of the pandemic in Germany many people's life satisfaction increased again. Roughly 60% of the respondents proved resilient in the sense that eight months after the outbreak of the pandemic they had regained the same or an even higher level of life satisfaction as compared to the situation before the COVID-19 crisis. Our results show that besides socioeconomic characteristics like age and income and certain character traits, people's personal experience during the crisis and their approval or disapproval of government policy during the crisis had an important influence on their chance to prove resilient.

Despite this recommendation, there is quite limited evidence describing the effect of early EN on outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The association between early EN (within 3 d post intubation) and clinical outcomes in adult COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation (within 2 d post ICU admission) was evaluated. DESIGN: We performed a nationwide observational cohort study using a nationwide administrative-financial database (Premier) in United States. SETTING: Information pertaining to all COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU from 75 hospitals between April and December 2020 was analyzed. PATIENTS: A total of 861 COVID-19 patients were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical outcomes were assessed via regression models to control for patient and hospital characteristics. We identified 513 COVID-19 ICU patients (59.2%) requiring mechanical ventilation who received early EN and had similar baseline characteristics to late EN group. Compared with late EN group, the early EN group had shorter ICU (hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.15C1.68) and hospital length of stays (LOS) (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23C1.91), fewer mechanical ventilation days (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01C1.54), and lower cost (C$22,443; 95% CI, C$32,342 to C$12,534). All comparisons were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, early EN is associated with earlier liberation from mechanical ventilation, shorter ICU and hospital LOS, and decreased cost. Our results are among the first to support guideline recommendations for initiation of early EN in COVID-19 ICU patients. Further, our data show nearly 40% of critically ill COVID-19 patients fail to have early EN initiated, even at 3 d post initiation of mechanical ventilation. These results emphasize the need for targeted strategies promoting initiation of early EN, as this may lead to improved clinical and economic outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients.","output":"Role of Early Enteral Nutrition in Mechanically Ventilated COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The UK's exit from the EU has had a mixed effect on scientists' assessment of their international mobility and future job market prospects, according to the 2020 STEM Survey","output":"STEM CAREERS IN THE BREXIT ERA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In order to understand the current status of the work of clinical-trial-related units, strengthen communication between units, analyze relevant impact factors, and predict development trends of good clinical practice (GCP) field in the future based on the severe epidemic situation Methods: Combined with key work in the GCP field, a questionnaire was compiled to widely understand the value of clinical trial staffs in response to outbreaks, the status of clinical trials, and their outlook for development Statistical analysis performed after feedback was collected Results: A total of 357 valid questionnaires were recovered 53 45% of clinical trial institutions released response rules within 3 days, and only 5 17% of clinical trial institutions have not released relevant response measures so far E-mail acceptance methods of research institutions accounted for 52 02%, suspended reviews of ethics committees accounted for 50 62%, and online conference reviews accounted for 22 36% The main methods of follow-up of the subjects: telephone follow-up 35 16%, delayed follow-up 21 8%, off-site follow-up 16 03% Off-site subjects who cannot come to the hospital and need to send medicine accounted for 50 62% and delayed drug administration for 28 88% Different sponsors, contract research organization (CRO), site management organization (SMO) companies have taken proactive measures, such as formulating detailed drug delivery processes based on project characteristics, and remote monitoring by clinical research associate (CRA) 86 27% of employees still have great confidence in the future development of the GCP field Conclusion: The epidemic has affected the current work of the GCP industry to varying degrees, but most units have adopted active and effective measures to maximize the health and safety of participants in clinical trials, and they still have strong confidence in the work status and development of units in GCP field after the epidemic","output":"Investigation and analysis of the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak on the development of GCP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate ocular surface disorders in students whose daily screen time increased due to distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted institutions hosting summer URE programs to offer them remotely, raising questions about whether undergraduates who participate in remote research can experience scientific integration. To address this, we investigated indicators of scientific integration for students who participated in remote life science URE programs in summer 2020. We found that these students experienced gains in their scientific self-efficacy and scientific identity similar to results reported for in-person UREs. We also found that these students perceived high benefits and low costs of doing research at the outset of their programs, and their perceptions did not change despite the remote circumstances. Yet, their perceptions differed by program, indicating that programs differentially affected students perceptions of the costs of doing research. Finally, we observed that students with prior research experience made greater gains in self-efficacy and identity, as well as in their perceptions of the alignment of their values with those of the scientific community, in comparison to students with no prior research experience. This finding suggests that additional programming may be needed for undergraduates with no prior experience to benefit from remote research.","output":"Virtually the same?

The study population for this review included asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in original articles published up to 30 April 2020. A random effects model was applied to analyze pooled data on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases among all COVID-19 patients and also by age and gender. From the meta-analysis of 16 studies, comprising 2,788 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the pooled prevalence according to the random effect size of asymptomatic cases was 48.2% (95% CI, 30C67%). Of the asymptomatic cases, 55.5% (95% CI, 43.6C66.8%) were female and 49.6% (95% CI, 20.5C79.1%) were children. Children and females were more likely to present as asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and could act as unknown carriers of SARS-CoV-2.

METHOD: We collected data from 59 self-reported EU/EEA/European identifying doctors working in the UK. We weighted results to the English National Health Service population in terms of gender, professional grade level and ethnicity and ran weighted regression analyses of respondents plans (leaving, considering, not considering) and whether they reported Brexit influencing their decision-making. We then examined how stating that Brexit affected their career, national identity, and sex and age related to doctors intentions to leave or stay. FINDINGS: The more doctors agreed that Brexit had impacted their professional lives, the more likely they were to state they intended to leave the UK. We found doctors with increased levels of British identity less likely to leave than those with reduced British identity. Interestingly, we found that those with higher levels of European identity were less likely to leave but more sharply likely to consider leaving compared to those with lower levels of European identity.

Autophagy dysregulation plays crucial roles during HS formation. The overexpressed p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in injured skin tissue after wound healing becomes a factor aggravating scar. The study was designed to investigate the role of p75NTR and p75NTR-mediated autophagy in the process of HS. The results revealed that p75NTR expression was significantly upregulated while that of autophagy proteins was downregulated in cicatrix at 3 and 6 months after burn, which was recovered at 12 months. p75NTR silencing inhibited proliferation, migration and ECM deposition of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSF), whereas p75NTR overexpression presented the opposite results. Silencing of p75NTR reduced the expression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling molecules while enhanced that of autophagy proteins. Importantly, PI3K agonist (IGF-1) intervention notably decreased the levels of LC3B II/I and Beclin-1, and restored the inhibitory effects of p75NTR silencing on proliferation, migration and ECM deposition of HSF. Concurrently, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) treatment exhibited the same variation trends with IGF-1. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that p75NTR silencing inhibits proliferation, migration and ECM deposition of HSF by activating autophagy through inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.","output":"p75NTR silencing inhibits proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix deposition of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts by activating autophagy through inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Navigation bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which doctors pass a bronchoscope into a subject's airways to sample the target pulmonary lesion.

Therefore, an accurate and efficient airway segmentation algorithm is essential to reduce bronchoscopists' burden of pre-procedural airway identification as well as patients' discomfort during the prolonged procedure.

As fibrinogen is affected by PI of WB, the effect of fibrinogen supplementation commonly used in trauma patients was also analyzed in this model. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Trauma transfusion scenarios were simulated by mixing untreated WB or WB treated with the Mirasol PI technology (riboflavin/UV) in different ratios with hemodiluted blood, and the thromboelasticity was monitored by ROTEM.

RESULTS Pathogen-inactivated WB (PI-WB) showed decreased activity in the hemostatic profile compared to the untreated control. Hemodiluted blood at a hematocrit (hct) of 20%, which was reconstituted with PI-WB or untreated WB, exhibited increased alpha values, maximum clot firmness, and clot formation time. Simulating transfusion scenarios by blood replacement with PI-WB resulted in a significant difference in ROTEM parameters between reconstituted PI-treated and -untreated WB (p  .05).

They significantly impact the quality of life of the patient. They are one of the most common causes of benign biliary strictures, which can result in serious complications such as recurrent cholangitis or secondary biliary cirrhosis. Although LC is a common operation today, the incidence of BDIs associated with LC is twice that of BDIs resulting from open cholecystectomies. CASE REPORT: In this paper, we present a case report of a patient after LC with the Class III-D injury according to the Stewart-Way classification. The injury was a result of a misleading description from a preoperative ultrasonography and a subsequent misunderstanding of the anatomical conditions of a patient with congenital gallbladder agenesis. The BDI was recognised first day after surgery. Thanks to a prompt transfer to our centre the patient was in a good condition. Biliary reconstruction could be done because there was no serious inflammation or biliary peritonitis at the time of reoperation. Due to the extent of the injury a Roux-en-Y tri-hepaticojejunostomy combined with external transhepatic biliary drains was performed. CONCLUSION: Iatrogenic BDI after a LC is a rare, but potentially life-threatening complication. The main risk factor is the presence of anatomical variants of the biliary tract. Early recognition and treatment in a department with adequately experienced hepatobiliary specialists are crucial for a positive outcome. The most frequent surgical treatment is a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.","output":"Rozshl porann ?lu?ovych cest po laparoskopick cholecystektomii ?e?en tri-hepatiko-jejunoanastomzou na Y-Roux kli?ku: kazuistika./ Extensive bile duct injury resulting from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy resolved by a Roux-en-Y tri-hepaticojejunostomy: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus is normally transmitted from animal to person, but nowadays it is transmitted from person to person by changing its form. Covid-19 appeared as a very dangerous virus and unfortunately caused a worldwide pandemic disease. Radiology doctors use X-ray or CT images for the diagnosis of Covid-19. It has become crucial to help diagnose such images using image processing methods. Therefore, we proposed a novel intelligent computer vision method to automatically detect the Covid-19 virus. The proposed automatic Covid-19 detection method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and feature selection stages. Image resizing and grayscale conversion are used in the preprocessing phase. The proposed feature generation method is called as Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP). In the feature selection phase, a novel iterative ReliefF (IRF) based feature selection is used. Decision tree (DT), linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighborhood (kNN) and subspace discriminant (SD) methods are chosen as classifiers in the classification phase. Leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV) and 10-fold cross-validation are used for training and testing. In this work, SVM classifier achieved 100.0% classification accuracy by using 10-fold cross-validation.

Typhi) is a highly invasive bacterium that infects the human intestinal mucosa and causes ~ 11.9C20.6 million infections and ~ 130,000C223,000 deaths annually worldwide. Oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a confers a moderate level of long-lived protection (5C7 years) in the field. New and improved vaccines against enteric pathogens are needed but their development is hindered by a lack of the immunological correlates of protection especially at the site of infection. Tissue resident memory T (T(RM)) cells provide immediate adaptive effector immune responsiveness at the infection site. However, the mechanism(s) by which S. Typhi induces T(RM) in the intestinal mucosa are unknown. Here, we focus on the induction of S. Typhi-specific CD4+T(RM) subsets by Ty21a in the human terminal ileum lamina propria and epithelial compartments. METHODS: Terminal ileum biopsies were obtained from consenting volunteers undergoing routine colonoscopy who were either immunized orally with 4 doses of Ty21a or not. Isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) CD4+T(RM) immune responses were determined using either S. Typhi-infected or non-infected autologous EBV-B cell lines as stimulator cells. T-CMI was assessed by the production of 4 cytokines [interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-17A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)] in 36 volunteers (18 vaccinees and 18 controls volunteers). RESULTS: Although the frequencies of LPMC CD103+ CD4+T(RM) were significant decreased, both CD103+ and CD103? CD4+T(RM) subsets spontaneously produced significantly higher levels of cytokines (IFN and IL-17A) following Ty21a-immunization. Importantly, we observed significant increases in S. Typhi-specific LPMC CD103+ CD4+T(RM) (IFN and IL-17A) and CD103? CD4+T(RM) (IL-2 and IL-17A) responses following Ty21a-immunization. Further, differences in S. Typhi-specific responses between these two CD4+T(RM) subsets were observed following multifunctional analysis. In addition, we determined the effect of Ty21a-immunization on IEL and observed significant changes in the frequencies of IEL CD103+ (decrease) and CD103? CD4+T(RM) (increase) following immunization. Finally, we observed that IEL CD103? CD4+T(RM), but not CD103+ CD4+T(RM), produced increased cytokines (IFN, TNF and IL-17A) to S. Typhi-specific stimulation following Ty21a-immunization. CONCLUSIONS: Oral Ty21a-immunization elicits distinct compartment specific immune responses in CD4+T(RM) (CD103+ and CD103?) subsets. This study provides novel insights in the generation of local vaccine-specific responses.

Excessive consumption is assumed to lead to a sedentary lifestyle, psychiatric disorders, overconsumption of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. But are these assumptions valid? METHODS: We supplemented data from the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study for Belgium with a bibliographical search of online databases (Medline, Scopus, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, PubMed) with the keywords 'adolescent' - 'internet' and 'sedentarity' or 'suicide' or 'family' or 'sex*' or 'porno*' for articles published between 2014 and 2019. We selected 27 original research articles and/ or quantitative or qualitative meta-analyses. RESULTS: Total consumption of different media (television, video games, internet) remained stable until 2010, and significantly increased in 2014. No parallel increase in sedentarity was reported. Controversy continues to surround the quantification of overconsumption, and the definition of 'problematic use'. Nevertheless, it appears that 5% of young people have unusual internet use, and 97.5% of these meet the criteria for a mental disorder. The risk of overconsumption is related to four factors: familial, personality, peer influence and supply. These general factors are supplemented by specific factors related to the abuse of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. For the latter, specific risk factors are the same as for suicidal young people who are not influenced by social media. CONCLUSION: Even if screen time is higher for Generation Alpha, these young people are no more at risk unless they accumulate risk factors. They are also exposed to challenges that researchers have not yet studied in any depth. One question relates to how they can manage their privacy if their parents published, without their consent, photographs of them as children? Another issue is their relationship to knowledge, given that everything they need to know can easily be found online.","output":"Screen Time and (Belgian) Teenagers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate the experiences of Danish patients treated at home for an acute illness instead of being hospitalised.

Interviews were conducted between August 2020 and April 2021. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-one patients, aged 34-94 years, narrated their experiences of being treated at home for an acute illness. RESULTS The overarching theme in our analyses was that 'being the centre of the nurses' attention provided safety, patient involvement and quality of life during home treatment'. The following six themes emerged from analyses: (1) exclusive attention facilitates involvement and activity; (2) hospitals are for the sick; (3) maintaining a meaningful everyday life; (4) the hospital exudes productivity and busyness; (5) family relations and roles are maintained; (6) and concerns of deterioration.

In contrast to the elder versions, COVID-19 spread vastly and quickly all over the world. World Health Organization (WHO) insists on adequate social distancing in order to decrease the risk of contagion by air. In the present work, different parameters which affect the necessary social distance were investigated. Drag coefficient around a Corona-shaped nanoparticle with the geometry of COVID-19 was determined by modeling laminar flow in different Reynolds numbers. Accordingly, modified correlations for drag coefficient were derived which implied to be much higher in Corona-shaped particles in compare to spherical ones. Applying the new modified correlation, the behavior of 120 nm to 120 mu m droplets generated by sneezing or coughing were investigated considering the evaporation of the volatile portion of the virus (around 94%), in different ambient conditions, namely temperature, pressure and relative humidity. Studying COVID-19 falling behavior showed that terminal velocity in Corona-shaped particles was much lower than spherical particles of the same size. It was also proved that falling time in Corona-shaped particles was longer, i.e. lasted longer in air. Ambient temperature increase and decrease in ambient relative humidity resulted into decrease in falling speed of the Corona particles. Decrease in ambient pressure, i.e. increase in elevation from sea level, yielded an increase in molecular free mean path which consequently resulted into reduction in falling speed. Hot dry areas were recognized to be critical from the viewpoint of COVID-19 spread through air.","output":"Numerical calculation of necessary distancing regarding SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vs. spherical viruses, based on environmental features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many governments to impose social distancing measures upon its citizens, including in the Netherlands. Motivating adolescents to adhere to measures such as social distancing can be challenging, since adolescents are relatively more affected by them, while experiencing virtually no personal health benefit. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to impact the social environment of adolescents in schools, as some media sources have reported bullying and stigmatisation of students with an Asian appearance. This study aims to explore the experiences of adolescents regarding their Health-Protective Behaviour (HPB), as well as the prevalence and expression of stigma towards ethnic minorities within the context of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a cross-sectional mixed-methods study, including two independent online questionnaires. An adapted version of the \\"HPB\\" questionnaire (n = 528) and the \\"Measure of Disease-Related Stigma (MDRS)\\" questionnaire (n = 380), were administered to Dutch adolescents of 10-16 years old, attending primary or secondary school. Furthermore, 15 interviews were held with eight male and seven female adolescents. All data collection took place between March 17 and April 20, 2020. Results show that adolescents perceive COVID-19 as a threat to other peoples' health, rather than their own, and report adherence to public health measures in the interest of older and more vulnerable members of their community. We found no convincing evidence for widespread misinformation or stigmatising of certain ethnic groups among adolescents related to COVID-19 during this study. Participants acknowledged such behaviour happened in the early stages of the pandemic, before this study was initiated.

This study aims to create and verify a simple nomogram and a dynamic web-based calculator for predicting the risk of SSI among gynecologic oncology patients. Methods: A retrospective evaluation was conducted on patients who were admitted into a tertiary hospital in China with confirmed diagnosis of gynecologic cancer between 01 August 2017 and 30 November 2021. A two-piecewise linear regression model with a smoothing function was used to investigate the non-linear association between GNRI and SSI to determine the ideal cut-off point. Three models were developed on the basis of different variables to predict SSI in gynecologic oncology patients. Through a nomogram the concordance index (C-index), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the integrated discrimination index (IDI) were used to determine the final model. Finally, the performance of the nomogram was validated using the 1,000-bootstrap resamples method and analyzed using C-index, GiViTI calibration belts, and decision curve. Also, a user-friendly dynamic web-based calculator was developed. Results: A total of 1,221 patients were included in the analysis. A non-linear association could be observed between GNRI and SSI risk with a GNRI cut-off value of 101.7. After adding GNRI to Model 2 (which comprised Morse Fall Scale score, preoperative length of stay, operation time, and estimated blood loss), the AIC value decreased, the C-index value increased and IDI increased significantly. The nomogram C-index in the development cohort and internal validation cohort demonstrates a moderate-high degree of discrimination. The GiViTI calibrated belt showed a good agreement between the observed and predicted probabilities of SSI. The decision curve validates the clinical feasibility of the nomogram with a threshold value between 0 and 49%. Conclusion: The GNRI cut-off value of 101.7 allowed for appropriate stratification of patients into distinct SSI risk groups. This study found that including GNRI in the above nomogram (Model 2) would enhance its potential to predict SSI in gynecologic oncology patients.","output":"Development and Validation of a Nomogram Based on Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index to Predict Surgical Site Infection Among Gynecologic Oncology Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the necessary focus on this pandemic, we must still care for the invisible patient.","output":"The Invisible Patient: Caring for Those without Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Time appears to pass irreversibly.

METHODS Pediatric patients with T1D in Colorado and surrounding states who received diabetes care using clinic-to-clinic telemedicine were enrolled. Medical records and surveys were reviewed to ascertain technology use, and data were compared to patients from the main clinic population. RESULTS Patients (N=128, baseline mean age 12.4  4.2 years, median T1D duration 3.3 years [IQR 1.4,7.7], mean A1c 8.9%  1.8, 60% male, 75% non-Hispanic white, 77% private insurance) who utilized telemedicine were included. Technology use among telemedicine patients was not associated with gender, T1D duration, insurance, distance from the main clinic or rural designation but was associated with ethnicity and A1c. Compared to the main clinic cohort (N=3,636), continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use and pump/CGM combination use was lower among patients participating in clinic-to-clinic telemedicine (CGM: 29.7% vs 56.0%, p<0.001; CGM/pump combination: 27.3% vs. 40.3%, p=0.004). Technology use was associated with lower A1c regardless of cohort. CONCLUSIONS Compared to patients attending in-person clinic, pediatric T1D patients who use clinic-to-clinic telemedicine due to their distance from the main clinic, have lower CGM and combination CGM/pump use. For both telemedicine and main clinic patients, CGM and CGM/pump combination was associated with lower A1c.

In the majority of symptomatic cases, COVID-19 results in a mild disease predominantly characterised by upper respiratory tract symptoms. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a nasopharyngeal sample is the mainstay of diagnosis, but there is an ~30% false negative rate early in the disease and in patients with mild disease, and therefore repeat testing may be required. RT-PCR positivity can persist for several days after resolution of symptoms. IgM and IgG antibody responses become positive several days after the onset of symptoms, and robust antibody responses are detectable in the second week of illness. Antibody-based immunoassays have a limited role in the diagnosis of early symptomatic disease. However, their incremental benefit over RT-PCR in the first 2 weeks of illness is currently being clarified in ongoing studies. Such assays may be useful for surveillance purposes.

This work sought to mathematically model infarct growth and determine whether infarct volume growth can be predicted by angiographic assessment of pial collateral recruitment in an experimental MCA occlusion animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Pial collateral recruitment was quantified by using DSA, acquired 15 minutes following permanent MCA occlusion in 6 canines based on a scoring system (average pial collateral score) and arterial arrival time. MR imaging-based infarct volumes were measured 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 and 1440 minutes following MCA occlusion and were parameterized in terms of the growth rate index and final infarct volume (VFinal) as V(t) = VFinal [1 - e(-G  t)] (t = time). Correlations of the growth rate index and final infarct volume to the average pial collateral score and arterial arrival time were assessed by linear bivariate analysis. Correlations were used to generate asymptotic models of infarct growth for average pial collateral score or arterial arrival time values. Average pial collateral score- and arterial arrival time-based models were assessed by F tests and residual errors. RESULTS Evaluation of pial collateral recruitment at 15 minutes postocclusion was strongly correlated with 24-hour infarct volumes (average pial collateral score: r2 = 0.96, P < .003; arterial arrival time: r2 = 0.86, P < .008). Infarct growth and the growth rate index had strong and moderate linear relationships to the average pial collateral score (r2 = 0.89; P < .0033) and arterial arrival time (r2 = 0.69; P < .0419), respectively. Final infarct volume and the growth rate index were algebraically replaced by angiographically based collateral assessments to model infarct growth. The F test demonstrated no statistical advantage to using the average pial collateral score- over arterial arrival time-based predictive models, despite lower residual errors in the average pial collateral score-based model (P < .03).

Through direct regional correlation of imaging findings to histopathological patterns, this study aimed to explain typical COVID-19 CT patterns at tissue level. METHODS: Eight autopsy cases were prospectively selected of patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 pneumonia with varying clinical manifestations and causes of death. All had been subjected to chest CT imaging 24-72 h prior to death. Twenty-seven lung areas with typical COVID-19 patterns and two radiologically unaffected pulmonary areas were correlated to histopathological findings in the same lung regions. RESULTS: Two dominant radiological patterns were observed: ground-glass opacity (GGO) (n = 11) and consolidation (n = 16). In seven of 11 sampled areas of GGO, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was observed. In four areas of GGO, the histological pattern was vascular damage and thrombosis, with (n = 2) or without DAD (n = 2). DAD was also observed in five of 16 samples derived from areas of radiological consolidation. Seven areas of consolidation were based on a combination of DAD, vascular damage and thrombosis. In four areas of consolidation, bronchopneumonia was found. Unexpectedly, in samples from radiologically unaffected lung parenchyma, evidence was found of vascular damage and thrombosis. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19, radiological findings of GGO and consolidation are mostly explained by DAD or a combination of DAD and vascular damage plus thrombosis.

The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is inappropriate to match the reality of COVID-19, because the collected data contradicts the models requirement that variance should be larger than the expected value. Our version of an IB model is more appropriate, as it can accommodate all potential data scenarios in which the variance is smaller, equal, or larger than the mean. This is unlike the usual IB, which accommodates only the scenario in which the variance is more than the mean. Therefore, we propose a refined version of an IB model to be able to accommodate all potential data scenarios. The application of the approach is based on a restricted infectivity rate and methodology on COVID-19 data, which exhibit two clusters of infectivity. Cluster 1 has a smaller number of primary cases and exhibits larger variance than the expected cases with a negative correlation of 28%, implying that the number of secondary cases is lesser when the number of primary cases increases and vice versa. The traditional IB model is appropriate for Cluster 1. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.13 among the primary, but is 0.75 among the secondary in Cluster 1, with a wider gap. Cluster 2, with a larger number of primary cases, exhibits smaller variance than the expected cases with a correlation of 79%, implying that the number of primary and secondary cases do increase or decrease together.

Global stability analysis of the equilibria was conducted using Lyapunov function which depends on the basic reproduction ratio R (0). If R (0) < 1, the disease free equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable, and if R (0)  1 the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable. We computed and predicted the basic reproduction ratios across all the years. It was found out that there were flaws in the exact values of R (0) which is related to the poor registration system of HIV/AIDS in Turkey. Hence, there is need for the government to improve the system in order to cover the actual cases of the disease.

BVDV has been grouped into two genotypes, genotype 1 and genotype 2. In this study, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, effective number of codon (ENC) values and nucleotide content were investigated, and a comparative analysis of codon usage patterns for open reading frames (ORFs) of 22 BVDV genomes, including 14 of genotype 1 and 8 of genotype 2, was carried out. A high A+U content and low codon bias were found in BVDV genomes. Depending on the RSCU data, it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage between the two genotypes, and a geographic factor exists only in genotype-1 of BVDV. The RSCU data have a negative correlation with general average hydrophobicity (GRAVY), aromaticity and nucleotide content. Furthermore, the overall abundance of C and U has no effect on the synonymous codon usage patterns. In contrast, the A and G content showed a significant correlation with the nucleotide content at the third position. In addition, the codon usage patterns of BVDV are similar to those of 22 conserved genes of Bos taurus.

These differences were determined by myriad political, financial, social, and economic factors - these factors are our focus. We ask what were the factors that are associated with the structure of the fiscal programs that governments chose to adopt in the early stage of the pandemic in 2020. We answer this question using details about the fiscal programs that were announced by 98 governments in the first six months of the pandemic, together with a large set of explanatory variables. Maybe not surprisingly, we find that politics played a very significant part in determining the size and composition of these fiscal programs. Governments and societies that are less polarized and more capable were able to mobilise more fiscal resources. We also find that it was governments with bigger debt loads that announced bigger programs, but that sovereign spreads were not so clearly associated with the size of these program plans. There is a limit, however, to what we can glean from these cross-country comparisons. Ultimately, the understanding of the politics and political-economy considerations that led to the specific content of each fiscal program will have to rely on information about the actual deliberations in each governments halls of power, should these ever become public.","output":"The Political Economy of the COVID-19 Fiscal Stimulus Packages of 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 may seem to have an impact on middle-aged and elderly people.

A format to guide discussions and interviews was made to bring uniformity across groups and participants. Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis method was used to extract key conceptual themes. RESULTS: There were 12 male and 10 female participants included, with a mean age of 62.2 years. Five subcategories identified were: Fear and anxiety, household confinement, lifestyle modification, preventive practices, and coping strategies. These sub-categories formed three major categories-psychological, social, and behavioral which ultimately led to the emergence of the main theme that is, COVID-19 effects on the life of middle-aged and older individuals.

The purpose of this study was to survey previous and current psychiatry residents, with the goal of describing the impact of the program on rural track residents compared to those in the traditional residency track. METHODS: Psychiatry residents 2010C2020 completed an online survey. For those who participated in the rural residency track, the survey asked additional questions regarding barriers experienced practicing in rural areas (e.g., professional isolation) and whether the goals of the rural track were met. RESULTS: Seventy-four residents completed surveys, with 26% in the Rural Track Group (RTG) and 74% in the Non-rural Track Group (NTG). More RTG reported they were more likely to practice in rural, frontier, or underserved areas after residency compared to NTG (74% versus 60%). Most RTG (72%) strongly agreed the rural program helped meet goals. Distance from family was a top barrier for current RTG (63%), followed by concerns about local schools, social isolation, and reduced career opportunities for partners (45%). CONCLUSIONS: Residents of the RTG were more likely to consider a career in a rural area than those of the traditional program alone.

The research design chosen by the researcher is the Pre-Experimental One-Group Pretest-Posttest Design. Participants in this study were 140 science student teachers who did distance practicum on basic biology practicum courses. Basic biology practicum is a practicum course that practices biological science including respiration photosynthesis, nutrient content of food and pollutant testing. Based on gender the participants were 62 male students and 78 female students. The value of N-Gain d > 0.58 (moderate effect) means that practicum activities can be continued as a practicum solution during the pandemic. Student activities during a practicum at home apply new adaptations different from a practicum in the laboratory. Independence in preparing materials and tools preparing worksheets simplifying materials and modifying tools is a new way for students. The study concludes that a new practicum method that utilizes the environment potential is a solution in the implementation of science practicums as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.

Ethiopia is one of developing countries estimated to have high prevalence of visual impairment which have an enormous socio-economic impact. Also there is limited available information regarding with the magnitude of visual impairment among adults in our country at large and east Gojjam zone in specific. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of visual impairment and its associated factors among patients attending Debre Markos Referral Hospital ophthalmic clinics in east Gojjam zone, North West Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Debre Markos Referral Hospital which is the only hospital in east gojjam zone with ophthalmic care service from March 1 to 30, 2020 by using systematic random sampling technique to select study participants after informed consent was obtained. Data were collected by interview with 5% pretested, structured questionnaire and ocular examinations. Data were cleaned, coded and entered to Epi-data version-3.1, and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science software version 26. The descriptive statistics was presented in tables, text and graphs. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with visual impairment was conducted. Covariates with P-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A study was conducted among 312 study participants with 96% response rate. The magnitude of visual impairment was 114 (36.5%) [95% CI, (33.8, 39.2%)]. Age > 50 years [AOR = 3.82; 95% CI (1.56, 9.35)], rural residency [AOR = 4.33 95% CI (1.30, 14.44)], inability to read and write [AOR = 3.21; 95% CI (1.18, 8.73)] and Cataract [AOR = 4.48; 95% CI (1.91, 10.52)] were factors significantly associated with visual impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The overall magnitude of visual impairment was found to be high. Older age, rural residency, inability to read and write and cataract were associated with visual impairment. Increasing literacy, expanded cataract surgery, as well as community based visual acuity screening especially for elders and rural residents is crucial.

The first was a well-established robust information technology infrastructure supporting virtual urgent care services at our institution; this connected physicians directly to patients using both the physician's and the patient's own mobile devices. The second is the concept of one patient, one chart, facilitated by a suite of interconnected electronic medical record (EMR) applications on several different device types.We present our experience with conducting general teleneurology encounters using secure synchronous audio and video connections integrated with an EMR.

ARDS in influenza-infected mice is associated with reduced levels of liponucleotides (essential precursors for de novo phospholipid synthesis) in alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells. Because surfactant phospholipid synthesis is a primary function of ATII cells, we hypothesized that disrupting this process could contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of influenza-induced ARDS. The goal of this study was to determine whether parenteral liponucleotide supplementation can attenuate ARDS. C57BL/6 mice inoculated intranasally with 10,000 pfu/mouse of H1N1 influenza A/WSN/33 virus were treated with CDP-choline (100 g/mouse, i.p.) +/- CDP-diacylglycerol 16:0/16:0 (10 g/mouse, i.p.) once daily from 1-5 days post-inoculation (to model post-exposure influenza prophylaxis) or as a single dose on day 5 (to model treatment of patients with ongoing influenza-induced ARDS). Daily post-exposure prophylaxis with CDP-choline attenuated influenza-induced hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, alterations in lung mechanics, impairment of alveolar fluid clearance, and pulmonary inflammation without altering viral replication. These effects were not recapitulated by daily administration of CTP and/or choline. Daily co-administration of CDP-diacylglycerol significantly enhanced the beneficial effects of CDP-choline and also modified the ATII cell lipidome, reversing the infection-induced decrease in phosphatidylcholine and increasing levels of most other lipid classes in ATII cells. Single-dose treatment with both liponucleotides at 5 days post-inoculation also attenuated hypoxemia, altered lung mechanics, and inflammation.

In addition to fever, cough, headache, and shortness of breath, an intense increase in immune response-based inflammation has been the hallmark of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection. This narrative review summarizes and critiques pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its plausible effects on drug metabolism and disposition. The release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukins, tumor necrosis factor ), also known as cytokine storm, leads to altered molecular pathophysiology and eventually organ damage in the lung, heart, and liver. The laboratory values for various liver function tests (e.g., alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin) have indicated potential hepatocellular injury in COVID-19 patients. Since the liver is the powerhouse of protein synthesis and the primary site of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug metabolism, even a minor change in the liver function status has the potential to affect the hepatic clearance of xenobiotics. It has now been well established that extreme increases in cytokine levels are common in COVID-19 patients, and previous studies with patients infected with non-SARS-CoV-2 virus have shown that CYP enzymes can be suppressed by an infection-related cytokine increase and inflammation. Alongside the investigational COVID-19 drugs, the patients may also be on therapeutics for comorbidities; especially epidemiological studies have indicated that individuals with hypertension, hyperglycemia, and obesity are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the average population. This complicates the drug-disease interaction profile of the patients as both the investigational drugs (e.g., remdesivir, dexamethasone) and the agents for comorbidities can be affected by compromised CYP-mediated hepatic metabolism. Overall, it is imperative that healthcare professionals pay attention to the COVID-19 and CYP-driven drug metabolism interactions with the goal to adjust the dose or discontinue the affected drugs as appropriate.","output":"Potential Effects of COVID-19 on Cytochrome P450-Mediated Drug Metabolism and Disposition in Infected Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To evaluate overall ischemic stroke volumes and rates, specific subtypes, and clinical presentation during the COVID-19 pandemic in a multicenter observational study from eight states across US.

However, there is no widely accepted priority setting evaluation framework. We reviewed literature with the aim of developing and proposing a framework for the evaluation of macro and meso level healthcare priority setting practices. METHODS We systematically searched Econlit, PubMed, CINAHL, and EBSCOhost databases and supplemented this with searches in Google Scholar, relevant websites and reference lists of relevant papers. A total of 31 papers on evaluation of priority setting were identified. These were supplemented by broader theoretical literature related to evaluation of priority setting. A conceptual review of selected papers was undertaken. RESULTS Based on a synthesis of the selected literature, we propose an evaluative framework that requires that priority setting practices at the macro and meso levels of the health system meet the following conditions: (1) Priority setting decisions should incorporate both efficiency and equity considerations as well as the following outcomes; (a) Stakeholder satisfaction, (b) Stakeholder understanding, (c) Shifted priorities (reallocation of resources), and (d) Implementation of decisions. (2) Priority setting processes should also meet the procedural conditions of (a) Stakeholder engagement, (b) Stakeholder empowerment, (c) Transparency, (d) Use of evidence, (e) Revisions, (f) Enforcement, and (g) Being grounded on community values. CONCLUSION Available frameworks for the evaluation of priority setting are mostly grounded on procedural requirements, while few have included outcome requirements. There is, however, increasing recognition of the need to incorporate both consequential and procedural considerations in priority setting practices.

Generalized Additive Models (GAM) were developed with respect to inter-annual variations, seasonal cycles, holiday effects, diurnal profile, and the non-linear influences of meteorological factors to quantitatively differentiate the lockdown effects and meteorology impacts on concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and fine particulate matters (PM(2.5)) at 34 sites in the Beijing area. The results revealed that lockdown measures caused large reductions while meteorology offset a large fraction of the decrease in surface concentrations. GAM estimates showed that in February, the control measures led to average NO(2) reductions of 19 g/m(3) and average PM(2.5) reductions of 12 g/m(3). At the same time, meteorology was estimated to contribute about 12 g/m(3) increase in NO(2), thereby offsetting most of the reductions as well as an increase of 30 g/m(3) in PM(2.5), thereby resulting in concentrations higher than the average PM(2.5) concentrations during the lockdown. At the beginning of the lockdown period, the boundary layer height was the dominant factor contributing to a 17% increase in NO(2) while humid condition was the dominant factor for PM(2.5) concentrations leading to an increase of 65% relative to the baseline level. Estimated NO(2) emissions declined by 42% at the start of the lockdown, after which the emissions gradually increased with the increase of traffic volumes. The diurnal patterns from the models showed that the peak of vehicular traffic occurred from about 12pm to 5pm daily during the strictest control periods.

SETTING: Community Participants: Individuals with mild to moderate stroke (N= 212) Interventions: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Individuals were assessed five times daily for 14 days with EMA surveys to determine what, with whom, and where individuals were doing activities and appraise mental, somatic, and cognitive symptoms. Individuals also completed standardized assessments during lab visits, including Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Activity Card Sort, PROMIS and NeuroQoL. RESULTS: Most individuals (median agea?=a?60 years; 55% males) were ischemic stroke (90%) and neurologically mild (median NIHSSa?=a?2). Total 14,140 EMA surveys were analyzed. Individuals were home 78% of the time, primarily participated in passive, unproductive activities (27%), especially watching television and resting, and participated least in physical activities (4%). EMA was sensitive to indicators of post-stroke disability; unemployed individuals reported fewer vocational activities but more activities of daily living (ADL) and passive activities than employed counterparts. Users of mobility devices and individuals with cognitive problems spent significantly less time on vocational activities and more on ADL than non-users and those without cognitive problems. Our data supported the validity of EMA methods in stroke, with small-to-moderate correlations of EMA with in-lab measures of daily functioning (r=-0.30 to 0.35, p-value < 0.05) and very large correlations between EMA and in-lab measures of symptoms, especially those measuring same constructs (r= -0.64 to 0.79, p-value < 0.0001).

Objective: The study intended to examine the features and characteristics of existing human coronaviruses and identify their resemblance to the newly identified 2019-nCoV. Design: The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19.

Setting: This study was take place in School of Pharmacy, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur, India. Results: The undistinguishable similarity of the genomic sequences of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and Bat SARS-CoV-bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-to nCoV-2019 has facilitated the process of identifying primary treatment measures. Researchers are presuming the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding in nCoV-2019, as in SARS-CoV. Researchers have been examining human-to-human transmission, the possibility of an intermediate host between bats and humans, and the existence of asymptomatic cases. An incubation period of 0 to 14 days has been reported, with acute to chronic symptoms being cough, nasal congestion, high fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, invasive lesions in both lungs, respiratory failure, and even death, including in pediatric cases. Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective. Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time. Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action. Conclusions: First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time.

Thus, rapid, accurate, and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods are in urgent demand to halt the spread of the virus. Objective: We aimed to validate the clinical performance of the FastProof? 30 min-TTR SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method using leftover ribonucleic acid (RNA) samples extracted from 315 nasopharyngeal swabs. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP were determined in comparison with RT-PCR. Result: Out of 315 nasopharyngeal swabs, viral RNA was detected in 154 (48.9%) samples by RT-PCR assay. Compared with RT-PCR, overall sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP were 81.82% (95% CI: 74.81C87.57) and 100% (95% CI: 97.73C100), respectively. A 100% positivity rate was achieved in samples with cycle threshold (Ct) <31 for RT-PCR targeting the ORF1ab gene. However, samples with Ct >31 accounted for false-negative results by RT-LAMP in 28 samples. Conclusion: RT-LAMP reliably detected viral RNA with high sensitivity and specificity and has potential application for mass screening of patients with acute COVID-19 infection, when viral load is high.","output":"Performance of colorimetric RT-LAMP as a diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the fourth wave of COVID-19 in Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disadvantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) is widely associated with disease and mortality, and there is no reason to think this will not be the case for the newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has reached a pandemic level. Individuals with a more disadvantaged SEP are more likely to be affected by most of the known risk factors of COVID-19. SEP has been previously established as a potential determinant of infectious diseases in general. We hypothesise that SEP plays an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic either directly or indirectly via occupation, living conditions, health-related behaviours, presence of comorbidities and immune functioning. However, the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 transmission, severity and outcomes is not yet known and is subject to scrutiny and investigation. Here we briefly review the extent to which SEP has been considered as one of the potential risk factors of COVID-19. From 29 eligible studies that reported the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and their potential risk factors, only one study reported the occupational position of patients with mild or severe disease. This brief overview of the literature highlights that important socioeconomic characteristics are being overlooked when data are collected. As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it is crucial to collect and report data on socioeconomic determinants as well as race/ethnicity to identify high-risk populations. A systematic recording of socioeconomic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 will be beneficial to identify most vulnerable groups, to identify how SEP relates to COVID-19 and to develop equitable public health prevention measures, guidelines and interventions.","output":"Importance of collecting data on socioeconomic determinants from the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak onwards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to develop a learning media for the development of open and distance learning.

To continue professional education during this crisis, web-based conferences can be conducted via livestream and an audience interaction platform as an alternative. OBJECTIVE: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has affected human connections worldwide. Conventional conferences have been replaced by web-based conferences. However, web-based conferencing has its challenges and limitations. This paper reports the logistics and preparations required for converting an international, on-site, multidisciplinary conference into a completely web-based conference within 3 weeks during the pandemic. METHODS: The program was revised, and a teleconference system, live recording system, director system setup, and broadcasting platform were arranged to conduct the web-based conference. RESULTS: We used YouTube (Alphabet Inc) and WeChat (Tencent Holdings Limited) for the web-based conference. Of the 24 hours of the conventional conference, 21.5 hours (90%) were retained in the web-based conference via live broadcasting. The conference was attended by 71% (37/52) of the original international faculties and 71% (27/38) of the overall faculties. In total, 61 out of 66 presentations (92%) were delivered. A special session-\\"Dialysis access management under the impact of viral epidemics\\"-was added to replace precongress workshops and competitions.

To construct highly functional flexible biosensors, abundant kinds of polymers substrates have been modified with sufficient properties to address certain needs. Paper-based biosensors gain considerable attention as well, owing to their foldability, lightweight and adaptability. The other important flexible biosensor employs textiles as substrate materials, which has a promising prospect in the area of intelligent wearable devices. In this feature article, we performed a comprehensive review about the applications of flexible biosensors based on the classification of substrate materials (polymers, paper and textiles), and illustrated the strategies to design effective and artificial sensing platforms, including colorimetry, fluorescence, and electrochemistry.

This information is critical for policy makers and practitioners to ensure the safety of staff, students and the wider community during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Public Health England initiated enhanced national surveillance following the reopening of educational settings during the summer mini-term on 01 June 2020. COVID-19 related situations in educational settings across England were reviewed daily and followed-up until 31 July 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreak rates were calculated for staff and students attending early year settings, primary and secondary schools during June 2020. FINDINGS There were 67 single confirmed cases, 4 co-primary cases and 30 COVID-19 outbreaks during June 2020, with a strong correlation between number of outbreaks and regional COVID-19 incidence (0.51 outbreaks for each SARS-CoV-2 infection per 100,000 in the community; p=0.001). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon across all educational settings. Staff members had an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to students in any educational setting, and the majority of cases linked to outbreaks were in staff. The probable transmission direction for the 30 confirmed outbreaks was: staff-to-staff (n=15), staff-to-student (n=7), student-to-staff (n=6) and student-to-student (n=2). INTERPRETATION SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon in educational settings during the first month after the easing of national lockdown in England. The strong correlation with regional SARS-CoV-2 incidence emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission to protect educational settings. Additional interventions should focus on reducing transmission in and among staff members.

This study thus compared the effect of two instructional approaches using a virtual lab to enhance students scientific literacy. Before students were given the opportunity to conduct science inquiries with the virtual lab, they were required to critique problematic inquiry cases (the critique group) or watch teachers demonstrations (the teacher demonstration group) before taking part in the inquiry. By analyzing data from 50 middle school students, this study found that the effect of applying virtual labs can be augmented by an instructional design that engages students in critiquing experiments prior to their inquiry with the virtual lab. This study also found a limitation of the use of virtual labs in helping students transfer what they have learned from the teachers demonstration to new inquiry contexts. A close relation among scientific literacy post-test scores, critiquing performance, and inquiry performance in the inquiry activity was detected, suggesting that student critiquing prior to inquiry is in alignment with the goal of developing students inquiry skills and scientific literacy with virtual labs.","output":"Augmenting the effect of virtual labs with \\"teacher demonstration\\" and \\"student critique\\" instructional designs to scaffold the development of scientific literacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: News media coverage of anti-mask protests, COVID-19 conspiracies, and pandemic politicization has overemphasized extreme views, but does little to represent views of the general public. Investigating the public's response to various pandemic restrictions can provide a more balanced assessment of current views, allowing policymakers to craft better public health messages in anticipation of poor reactions to controversial restrictions. OBJECTIVE: Using data from social media, this study aims to understand the changes in public opinion associated with the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions (e.g. business and school closure, regional lockdown differences, additional public health restrictions such as social distancing and masking). METHODS: COVID-related tweets in Ontario (n=1,150,362) were collected based on keywords between March 12 to Oct 31 2020. Sentiment scores were calculated using the VADER algorithm for each tweet to represent its negative to positive emotion. Public health restrictions were identified using government and news media websites, and dynamic regression models with ARIMA errors were used to examine the association between public health restrictions and changes in public opinion over time (i.e. collective attention, aggregate positive sentiment, and level of disagreement) controlling for the effects of confounders (i.e. daily COVID-19 case counts, holidays, COVID-related official updates). RESULTS: In addition to expected direct effects (e.g. business closure led to decreased positive sentiment and increased disagreements), the impact of restriction on public opinion is contextually driven. For example, the negative sentiment associated with business closures was reduced with higher COVID-19 case counts. While school closure and other restrictions (e.g. masking, social distancing, and travel restrictions) generated increased collective attention, they did not have an effect on aggregate sentiment or the level of disagreement (i.e. sentiment polarization). Partial (region-targeted) lockdowns were associated with better public response (i.e. higher number of tweets with net positive sentiment and lower levels of disagreement) compared to province-wide lockdowns. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a rapid and flexible method of evaluating the public response to pandemic restrictions using near real-time social media data. This information can help public health practitioners and policymakers anticipate public response to future pandemic restrictions, and ensure adequate resources are dedicated to addressing increases in negative sentiment and levels of disagreement in the face of scientifically informed, but controversial, restrictions.","output":"Changes in public response associated with various COVID-19 restrictions in Ontario, Canada: an observational study using social media time series data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asymptomatic patients and infected patients with normal chest CT imaging are considered carriers of SARS-CoV-2.

On the one hand, it is argued that drug users ? and the drug markets in which they interact ? may have become the incidental targets of law enforcement as police seek to enforce social distancing regulations by focusing their efforts on street-level pedestrian activity or open-air gatherings. On the other, interstate border closures and restrictions on person and freight traffic are thought to have interrupted illicit drug supply chains, temporarily reducing or displacing market activity at the street level and thus reducing police detections of drug users. In this study, we extend current analyses of crime during the COVID-19 pandemic to explore how the rate of police detection for drug possession and other drug-related offences has changed. Using crime data from the Australian state of Queensland, we use Auto-Regressive Integrated and Moving Average time series modelling techniques to explore historical trends and their dynamic forecasts. We then compare actual offence rates for March through June to identify any statistically significant changes. We find that reported drug offences significantly vary across time and location highlighting that the impact of COVID-19 is not universal across Queensland. Thus, the significant heterogeneity in local drug market dynamics that has elsewhere been documented remains even in a major crisis with significant changes in policing activity and resource allocation.

Interferon gamma (IFNG) plays an important role in viral replication. QuantiFERON-TB (QFT) test relies on IFNG release in response to antigens. A positive or negative test signifies adequate IFNG response, whereas an indeterminate result is obtained when such a response is lacking. In this study, we have attempted to see if an indeterminate QFT result can provide prognostic information on patients with COVIDC19. Survival Probability in patients with Covid - 19 and an indeterminate TB Quantiferon test result [Image: see text] METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients who were admitted at our institute with COVIDC19 and had a QFT done within one month of the positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test result. Patient charts were analyzed for clinical course and outcomes, including in-hospital mortality (primary outcome), 90-day mortality, respiratory failure, requirement for intubation and other complications that would portend a more severe disease course. RESULTS: A total of 120 patient charts were analyzed, out of which 43 (35.8%) had an indeterminate QFT. All the indeterminate results were due to an inadequate mitogen response. The indeterminate QFT group had a 41.86% (18/43) in-hospital mortality vs. 9.09% (7/77) in the negative or positive QFT group (p-value of < 0.001). The 90-day mortality was similar between the two groups. Patients with indeterminate QFT also had a higher incidence of respiratory failure (97.7% vs. 75.3%; p-value = 0.020), requirement for mechanical ventilation (55.8% vs. 23.4%; p-value < 0.001), requirement of ECMO (25.58% vs. 0%; p-vale < 0.001), requirement of pressor (48.83% vs. 14.28%; p-value < 0.001) and requirement for renal replacement therapy (32.5% vs. 1.3%; p-value < 0.001), when compared to patients with a negative or positive QFT. Patients in indeterminate group had a higher hospital length of stay than the other group (p-value = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that patients with COVID-19 who fail to mount an adequate IFNG mitogen response in QFT assay have worse clinical outcomes and a more complicated and protracted clinical course. Evaluating cell-mediated immune responses through commercially available IFNG release assays may yield a promising strategy to predict COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

Many vaccine strategies developed to control the disease are not yet completely successful. Hairpin expression vectors have been used to induce gene silencing in a large number of studies on viruses. However, none of these studies has been attempted to study GTPV. In the interest of exploiting improved methods to control goat pox, it is participated that RNAi may provide effective protection against GTPV. In this study we show the suppression of Goatpox virus (GTPV) replication via knockdown of virion core protein using RNA interference. RESULTS: Four short interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences (siRNA-61, siRNA-70, siRNA-165 and siRNA-296) against a region of GTPV ORF095 were selected. Sense and antisense siRNA-encoding sequences separated by a hairpin loop sequence were designed as short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes under the control of a human U6 promoter. ORF095 amplicon was generated using PCR, and then cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector, named as p095/EGFP. p095/EGFP and each of the siRNA expression cassettes (p61, p70, p165 and p296) were co-transfected into BHK-21 cells. Fluorescence detection, flow cytometric analysis, retro transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and real time PCR were used to check the efficiency of RNAi. The results showed that the ORF095-specific siRNA-70 effectively down-regulated the expression of ORF095. When Vero cells were transfected with shRNA expression vectors (p61/GFP, p70/GFP, p165/GFP and p296/GFP) and then infected with GTPV, GTPV-ORF095-70 was found to be the most effective inhibition site in decreasing cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by GTPV. The results presented here indicated that DNA-based siRNA could effectively inhibit the replication of GTPV (approximately 463. 5-fold reduction of viral titers) on Vero cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that vector-based shRNA methodology can effectively inhibit GTPV replication on Vero cells. Simultaneously, this work represents a strategy for controlling goatpox, potentially facilitating new experimental approaches in the analysis of both viral and cellular gene functions during of GTPV infection.","output":"RNA interference targeting virion core protein ORF095 inhibits Goatpox virus replication in Vero cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an illness caused by a novel coronavirus family. One of the practical examinations for COVID-19 is chest radiography. COVID-19 infected patients show abnormalities in chest X-ray images. However, examining the chest X-rays requires a specialist with high experience. Hence, using deep learning techniques in detecting abnormalities in the X-ray images is presented commonly as a potential solution to help diagnose the disease. Numerous research has been reported on COVID-19 chest X-ray classification, but most of the previous studies have been conducted on a small set of COVID-19 X-ray images, which created an imbalanced dataset and affected the performance of the deep learning models. In this paper, we propose several image processing techniques to augment COVID-19 X-ray images to generate a large and diverse dataset to boost the performance of deep learning algorithms in detecting the virus from chest X-rays. We also propose innovative and robust deep learning models, based on DenseNet201, VGG16, and VGG19, to detect COVID-19 from a large set of chest X-ray images. A performance evaluation shows that the proposed models outperform all existing techniques to date. Our models achieved 99.62% on the binary classification and 95.48% on the multi-class classification. Based on these findings, we provide a pathway for researchers to develop enhanced models with a balanced dataset that includes the highest available COVID-19 chest X-ray images.

RESULTS: Among all tests, 3.2% were positive. Older children consistently made up the larger portion of positive pediatric cases, regardless of community prevalence. Increased pediatric cases later in the pandemic when prevalence in adults was relatively low correlates with a higher number of tests performed in children and not with an increased positivity rate. No significant changes in trends of positivity were detected after the reopening of schools. Symptomatic and asymptomatic children had similar cycle threshold values regardless of age, and a subset of children demonstrated persistent viral detection, some for as long as 6 weeks.

However, adsorption of polar functionalities can be induced rapidly by annealing in a polar environment such as glycerol prior to quenching to a glassy state. Blended films of carboxy end-functionalised deuteriopolystyrene (dPS-COOH) with hydrogenous polystyrene (hPS) were annealed at 150 C under glycerol. Nuclear reaction analysis was used to quantify the surface excess of dPS-COOH retained at the surface after quenching the films to below the glass transition temperature. Incorporation of multiple COOH groups onto a single chain end greatly increases the affinity of these chains to the interface with glycerol. Here we have shown that even a difunctional material, dPS-2COOH, is much more surface active than either the singly functionalised dPS-COOH or the difunctional ester from which it was prepared.

To investigate those two questions, this work focuses on cross-border relations in various parts of the world primarily focusing of the role trading relations or localCcentral relations would play in developing cross-border networks spanning an international boundary. In an era of globalisation, increased trade across regions of the world seem to have led to a specific increased cross-border cooperation, however, taking different forms from intense trading relations to resulting cross-border institutionalisation.

This case presents one of the atypical etiologies of hypercalcemia. Clinical Case: A 53-year-old man with past medical history of nephrectomy was admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2. Hospital stay was complicated by septic shock and acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis. Three months post hospital admission, the patient developed non-parathyroid (PTH) mediated hypercalcemia.

Patient received tube feedings that contained 2192 mcg retinol activity equivalents of vitamin A daily, which is associated with vitamin A intoxication in the presence of renal insufficiency. Vitamin A returned 0.78 mg/L (0.3C1.2). Serum Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) was elevated at 12.4 pmol/L (0.0C2.0). There was no obvious malignancy on various imaging studies. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed biliary stricturing suggestive of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), however, liver biopsy was not consistent with PSC. Serum IgG4 level was found to be elevated to 142 mg/dl (range: 1C123) which raised suspicion for autoimmune cholangiopathy. Discussion: Patient presented with non-PTH mediated hypercalcemia with low serum 1,25 OHD levels and elevated serum PTHrP level. Although most cases of elevated PTHrP associated with hypercalcemia are due to solid tumors, increased PTHrP levels have been seen in hypercalcemic patients with hematological malignancies and rare benign causes such as pneumonia (5). Association of elevated hypercalcemia with elevated IgG4 levels and PTHrP levels has not been previously reported. MRCP findings and abnormal morphology detailed in liver biopsy are suggestive of IgG4-related disease (IgG4RD) (3). The responsiveness in hypercalcemia to prednisone also supports this diagnosis.

We found secondary zinc smelting as a significant source of Cl/Br-PAHs (9553 ng/m3 in stack gas), exceeding concentrations from other metal smelting sources by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Cl/Br-PAH emission characteristics differed between various secondary metal smelting processes, indicating dominance of different formation mechanisms. Cl/Br-PAHs with fewer rings were dominant from secondary zinc smelting and secondary copper smelting. Differently, emissions from secondary aluminum smelting were dominated by congeners with more rings. The differences in congener profiles were attributable to the catalytic effects of metal compounds during smelting activities. Zinc oxide and copper oxide dominantly catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions, contributing to the formation of intermediate radicals and subsequent dimerization to Cl/Br-PAHs with fewer rings. Differently, aluminum oxide induced alkylation reactions and accelerated ring growth, resulting in the formation of Cl-PAHs with more rings.

METHODS The serum miR-29a levels were measured in 360 subjects (180 T2DM patients and 180 healthy controls) using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), and other conventional indicators were measured and analysed. A binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the DN risk factors; a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to analyse the diagnostic efficacy of miR-29a for DN, and a Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between serum miR-29a and cystatin C. RESULTS The serum miR-29 levels in the T2DM patients were higher than those in the healthy subjects and significantly increased with the progression of DN (p < 0.05). Serum miR-29a and cystatin C are independent predictors of the occurrence of DN. Compared with a single indicator, the combination of serum miR-29a and cystatin C has better DN diagnostic performance. In addition, the serum miR-29a levels were positively correlated with cystatin C in the patients with DN (r = 0.521, p < 0.001).

METHODS: Chest CT images of patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive COVID-19 were categorized according to the CORADS and RSNA classifications by radiologists with different levels of experience and who were initially unaware of the RT-PCR results. The inter- and intra-observer concordances for each of the classifications were calculated, as were the concordances between classifications. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in this study. The RSNA classification showed an almost perfect inter-observer agreement between reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.892 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.788-0.995). CORADS showed substantial agreement among reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.642 (95% CI, 0.491-0.793). There was inter-observer variation when comparing less experienced reviewers with more experienced reviewers, with the highest kappa coefficient of 0.396 (95% CI, 0.255-0.588). There was a significant correlation between both classifications, with a Kendall coefficient of 0.899 (p<0.001) and substantial intra-observer agreement for both classifications. CONCLUSION: The RSNA and CORADS classifications showed excellent inter-observer agreement for reviewers with the same level of experience, although the agreement between less experience reviewers and the reviewer with the most experience was only reasonable. Combined analysis of both classifications with the first RT-PCR results did not reveal any false-negative results for detecting COVID-19 in patients.","output":"Evaluation of the RSNA and CORADS classifications for COVID-19 on chest computed tomography in the Brazilian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complex networks in the real world are often with heterogeneous degree distributions. The structure and function of nodes can vary significantly, with vital nodes playing a crucial role in information spread and other spreading phenomena. Identifying and taking action on vital nodes enables change to the networks structure and function more efficiently. Previous work either redefines metrics used to measure the nodes importance or focuses on developing algorithms to efficiently find vital nodes. These approaches typically rely on global knowledge of the network and assume that the structure of the network does not change over time, both of which are difficult to achieve in the real world. In this paper, we propose a localized strategy that can find vital nodes without global knowledge of the network. Our joint nomination (JN) strategy selects a random set of nodes along with a set of nodes connected to those nodes, and together they nominate the vital node set. Experiments are conducted on 12 network datasets that include synthetic and real-world networks, and undirected and directed networks. Results show that average degree of the identified node set is about 3C8 times higher than that of the full node set, and higher-degree nodes take larger proportions in the degree distribution of the identified vital node set. Removal of vital nodes increases the average shortest path length by 20C70% over the original network, or about 8C15% longer than the other decentralized strategies. Immunization based on JN is more efficient than other strategies, consuming around 12C40% less immunization resources to raise the epidemic threshold to [Formula: see text] . Susceptible-infected-recovered simulations on networks with 30% vital nodes removed using JN delays the arrival time of infection peak significantly and reduce the total infection scale to 15%. The proposed strategy can effectively identify vital nodes using only local information and is feasible to implement in the real world to cope with time-critical scenarios such as the sudden outbreak of COVID-19.","output":"Hunting for vital nodes in complex networks using local information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growing environmental concerns, increased population, and the need to meet the diversification of the source of global energy have led to increased demand for biofuels. However, the high cost of raw materials for biofuels production has continued to slow down the acceptability, universal accessibility, and affordability of biofuels. The cost of feedstock and catalysts constitutes a major component of the production cost of biofuels. Potato is one of the most commonly consumed food crops among various populations due to its rich nutritional, health, and industrial benefits. In the current study, the application of potato peel waste (PPW) for biofuel production was interrogated. The present state of the conversion of PPW to bioethanol and biogas, through various techniques, to meet the ever-growing demand for renewable fuels was reviewed. To satisfy the escalating demand for biohydrogen for various applications, the prospects for the synthesis of biohydrogen from PPW were proposed. Additionally, there is the potential to convert PPW to low-cost, ecologically friendly, and biodegradable bio-based catalysts to replace commercial catalysts. The information provided in this review will enrich scholarship and open a new vista in the utilization of PPW. More focused investigations are required to unravel more avenues for the utilization of PPW as a low-cost and readily available catalyst and feedstock for biofuel synthesis. The application of PPW for biofuel application will reduce the pump price of biofuels, ensure the appropriate disposal of waste, and contribute towards environmental cleanliness.","output":"Biofuel Generation from Potato Peel Waste: Current State and Prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 health crisis triggered changes in the workplace.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an effective preventive approach that includes several core components. Physical training is identified as an integral and essential part of CR. Training can positively influence several cardiovascular risk factors in people diagnosed with coronary heart disease and prevent them from clinical events. Our study aims to research the method of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in a home environment using telerehabilitation. We assume that the HIIT form of telerehabilitation, using a heart rate monitor as a tool for backing up training data, can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and lead to higher peak oxygen uptake than the traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). METHODS: This study is designed as a monocentral randomized controlled trial at University Hospital Brno in the Czech Republic. After the coronary heart event, the suitable patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) and separated into 2 groups: the experimental HIIT group and the control MICT group. Both groups undergo a 12-week telerehabilitation with a 1-year follow-up period. Study participants will be telemonitored during physical training in their home environment via a heart rate monitor and a web platform. Once a week, the patients will give their feedback and motivation by a telephone call. The primary outcome observed will be the effect of intervention expressed by changes in cardiorespiratory fitness. Secondary outcomes will be the health-related quality of life, anxiety, training adherence, body composition, safety, and satisfaction. DISCUSSION: The HIIT is widely researched predominantly in a center-based supervised form. Our study differs from others by the use of telemedicine and smart technologies in home-based settings. Previous home-based cardiac telerehabilitation studies have focused primarily on MICT, which has demonstrated feasibility, and results have shown similar improvements as center-based CR. There is a presumption that HIIT may be superior to MICT. However, it can be complicated to self-dose the method in the home environment. Investigators expect that HIIT research will provide insight into the possibilities of telemedicine feasibility, effect, and limitations of coronary heart disease patients use at low to moderate cardiovascular risk.","output":"Effect of home-based high-intensity interval training using telerehabilitation among coronary heart disease patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the performance of machine learning algorithms trained exclusively with configurations obtained from importance sampling Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Ising model with conserved magnetization.

However, the possibilities to perform physical activity are compromised by the running COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the relationship between self-reported physical activity levels during COVID-19 and subjective well-being. Furthermore, our secondary aim was to investigate whether personal well-being was different between men and women and between people with different self-reported physical activity levels. METHODS Physical activity rate and subjective well-being were assessed using specific online surveys. Well-being was investigated using the 5-item World Health Organization Well-being Index while physical activity rates using the official Italian short form of IPAQ. Participation was voluntary, and people could fill the questionnaire simply by clicking on a specific link reachable via Social Networks or by email. RESULTS The final sample size was 595 Italian responders. Male and female were equally distributed (50,3% male and 49,7% female). The multiple regression indicated that the model was a significant predictor of subjective well-being (R2 =,070,F (3,59) = 14,68, p< 0.0001). The univariate ANOVA detected a statistically significant difference in subjective well-being perception between gender (p<0,05; ?2= ,01) and among physical activity rates ((whole sample: p<0,0001, ?2=0,03); Males: F(2,296)=4,364, p<0,01, ?2=0,03; Females: F(2,293)=5,256, p<0,001, ?2=0,04)).

STUDY DESIGN It contained four parts. First, the chemical compounds in FF were detected by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) with data-dependent acquisition, and further, the targeted compounds were screened out based on an in-house database. In the meantime, the representative MS/MS fragmentation behaviors of different chemical structure types were summarized. Second, homologous constituents were grouped and organized based on feature-guided molecular networking, and the nontargeted components with homologous mass fragmentation behaviors were characterized. Third, the novel compounds were isolated and unambiguously identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Finally, the anti-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activities of isolated chemical constituents were further evaluated by in vitro experiments. RESULTS A total of 278 compounds were profiled in FF, including 151 targeted compounds and 127 nontargeted compounds. Among them, 16 were unambitiously identified by comparison with reference standards. Moreover, 25 were classified into potential novel compounds. Two novel compounds were unambiguously identified by using conventional chromatographic methods, and they were named phillyrigeninside D (peak 254) and forsythenside O (peak 155). Furthermore, the ACE2 activity of the compounds in FF was evaluated by modern pharmacological methods, and among them, suspensaside A was confirmed to present obvious anti-ACE2 activity.

Moreover, to demonstrate the generalizability of IMFC-Net, experiments were performed with two augmentation techniques and without augmentation, in which our model ranked first, with a considerable difference from the comparison models. A gradient-weighted class activation map technique was also used to find distinct implant characteristics needed for IMFC-Net classification decisions. Results: The results confirmed that the proposed IMFC-Net model yielded an average accuracy of 89.09%, a precision rate of 89.54%, a recall rate of 86.57%, and an F1.score of 87.94%, which were higher than those of the comparison models. Conclusion: The proposed model is efficient and can minimize the revision complexities of implants.","output":"Artificial Intelligence-Based Solution in Personalized Computer-Aided Arthroscopy of Shoulder Prostheses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CME Sonography 98: Chest Ultrasound Abstract.

Human behavior plays a fundamental role in the spreading dynamics and can be used to stop a disease from spreading or to reduce its burden, as individuals aware of the presence of a disease can take measures to reduce their exposure to contagion. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the spread of diseases with awareness in complex networks. Unlike previous models, the information is propagated following a generalized Maki-Thompson rumor model. Flexibility on the timescale between information and disease spreading is also included. We verify that the velocity characterizing the diffusion of information awareness greatly influences the disease prevalence. We also show that a reduction in the fraction of unaware individuals does not always imply a decrease of the prevalence, as the relative timescale between disease and awareness spreading plays a crucial role in the systems' dynamics. This result is shown to be independent of the network topology. We finally calculate the epidemic threshold of our model, and show that it does not depend on the relative timescale. Our results provide a new view on how information influence disease spreading and can be used for the development of more efficient methods for disease control.","output":"Epidemic spreading with awareness and different timescales in multiplex networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives around the world. Autistic adults are at higher risk for co-occurring medical and psychiatric conditions and may be more prone to difficulties adapting to pandemic-related changes and social distancing mandates and coping with ongoing uncertainties. On the other hand, the pandemic may lead to greater understanding and acceptance of accommodations in the broader community that may facilitate supports for autistic adults beyond the pandemic. To learn more about their early pandemic experiences, online surveys were sent to independent adults enrolled in the Simons Powering Autism Research Knowledge (SPARK). The first survey was open from March 30 to April 19, 2020; a follow-up survey sent to original responders was open from May 27 to June 6, yielding 396 participants with data for both surveys. We found that adults who were female, younger, had prior diagnoses of a mental health condition, personal COVID-19 experience (i.e., knowing someone who had symptoms or tested positive) or less frequent hope for the future reported the greatest negative impacts. Decrease in feelings of hopefulness over time predicted greater psychological distress at T2, accounting for T1 impact and distress levels and increases in total COVID-19 impact. Less perceived benefit of online services also predicted later distress. Although there tends to be a focus on coping with negative effects of the pandemic, mental health providers may consider approaches that focus on positives, such as fostering hope and understanding factors that facilitate benefit from online services. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic adults may be at risk for psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study suggests that autistic adults who were younger, female, had a mental health diagnosis before the pandemic and knew someone who showed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19 reported more areas negatively impacted by COVID-19 and greater difficulty coping with those effects. Decreases in hope over time were associated with greater psychological distress. Less perceived benefit from online services also predicted distress 2 months later. These results suggest important areas to further explore as we develop supports for autistic adults during the pandemic.","output":"Early Pandemic Experiences of Autistic Adults: Predictors of Psychological Distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in the suspension of many routine audiology services due to the risk of cross-infections in closed spaces. This has driven the need for exploring alternatives to conventional face-to-face consultations in the hospital outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of remote consultations and assessments for patients on the waiting list for consideration of bone conduction hearing devices (BCHDs), and whether this type of consultation could continue beyond the COVID-19 era. METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study in a tertiary Neuro-otology Department. All new patients on the waiting list for assessment for BCHD as of 1 March 2020 were included. Patients case notes were reviewed. All underwent a telephone consultation with an implant audiologist. If the patient wanted to go ahead with the remote trial, a BCHD sound processor on a headband would be mailed out and the patient would then have to use the device for two weeks and return the device after with their diary. RESULTS: There were 49 patients. The mean age was 55 (range 27C88, SD 16.3). Four did not proceed with the trial. All patients returned their devices to the department. Majority of patients (95.6%, n = 43), completed their diary. 75.6% wanted to proceed with surgery. All patients proceeding with surgery were happy with the remote assessment and would recommend this for the future. CONCLUSION: It is possible to satisfactorily assess appropriately screened patients for BCHDs remotely with a structured approach and explanation of process and expectations. It might be possible to consider this type of consultation as an option for assessing potential candidates for BCHDs beyond the COVID-19 era to reduce the number of hospital visits for patients.","output":"Remote assessments for bone conduction hearing devices during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A cells phenotype and function are influenced by dynamic interactions with its microenvironment.

Although mass gatherings present an important risk for future SSEs, we find that the bulk of transmission in the first wave occurred in smaller events at settings like workplaces, grocery stores, or food venues. We also observe that places where the majority of transmission and SSEs happened changed during the pandemic and are different across cities, a signal of the large underlying behavioral component underneath them.

While those with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) represent the highest risk group, this is a condition that is not routinely ruled out since it requires amniocentesis. Identification of low-risk or high-risk cases might allow individualisation of care, that is, reducing overtreatment with corticosteroids and shorten hospital stay in low-risk women, while allowing early antibiotic therapy in those with MIAC. Benefits versus risks of amniocentesis-based predictor models of spontaneous delivery within 7 days and/or MIAC have not been evaluated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a Spanish randomised, multicentre clinical trial in singleton pregnancies (23.0C34.6 weeks) with PTL, conducted in 13 tertiary centres. The intervention arm will consist in the use of amniocentesis-based predictor models: if low risk, hospital discharge within 24 hours of results with no further medication will be recommended. If high risk, antibiotics will be added to standard management. The control group will be managed according to standard institutional protocols, without performing amniocentesis for this indication. The primary outcome will be total antenatal doses of corticosteroids, and secondary outcomes will be days of maternal stay and the occurrence of clinical chorioamnionitis. A cost analysis will be undertaken. To observe a reduction from 90% to 70% in corticosteroid doses, a reduction in 1 day of hospital stay (SD of 2) and a reduction from 24% to 12% of clinical chorioamnionitis, a total of 340 eligible patients randomised 1 to 1 to each study arm is required (power of 80%, with type I error =0.05 and two-sided test, considering a dropout rate of 20%).

METHODS: For this qualitative realist case\\\\study, 19 interviews (one dyad) were held with (20) low\\\\income citizens in two Dutch municipalities. Additionally, the results were discussed with a reference panel consisting of professionals and citizens to enrich the results and to ensure the results had face validity. RESULTS: The results showed four different ways in which low\\\\income citizens wished to be involved: (a) in a practical/volunteer way; (b) as a buddy; (c) as a lay expert; (d) not involved at all. The factors affecting citizens interest and capacity to participate include citizens own experiences of the services they access and their personal situations, e.g. their mental or physical health, extent of financial crisis, family situation, home environment. None of the interviewees was currently involved, but all had ideas for improving health(care) services and policies. Citizens experiences of the services they accessed acted as a motivator for some to be involved as they wanted to ensure others would not have the same struggles, while for others their own needs and an apathetic system remained too high a barrier. To enable involvement, citizens need continued support for their own health(care) and financial situation, better communication and accessibility from services, practical support (e.g., training and bus passes) and recognition for their input (e.g., monetary compensation). CONCLUSION: The study shows that citizens experiences of the services they accessed influenced if and how they wanted to be involved with health and care services. Despite the fact that all participants had shared solid ideas for improving services and policies, they were hindered by a bureaucratic, impersonal and inaccessible system.

Next, qPCRs were tested on 15 sputa from 11 participants with P. aeruginosa respiratory infections to determine AMR profiles in vivo. We confirmed multiplex qPCR testing feasibility directly on sputa, representing a key advancement in in vivo AMR diagnosis. Notably, comparison of sputa with their derived isolates grown in Luria-Bertani broth (2.5% NaCl) or a 5-antibiotic cocktail showed marked expression differences, illustrating the difficulty in replicating in vivo expression profiles in vitro. Cystic fibrosis sputa showed significantly reduced mexE and mexY expression compared with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease sputa, despite harboring fluoroquinolone- and aminoglycoside-resistant strains, indicating that these loci do not contribute to AMR in vivo. oprD was also significantly downregulated in cystic fibrosis sputa, even in the absence of contemporaneous carbapenem use, suggesting a common adaptive trait in chronic infections that may affect carbapenem efficacy. Sputum ampC expression was highest in participants receiving carbapenems (6.7 to 15), some of whom were simultaneously receiving cephalosporins, the latter of which would be rendered ineffective by the upregulated ampC.

We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for hospital-based IPC practices in resource-constrained settings of LMICs. For cases of confirmed or suspected COVID-19, we suggest that patients be placed in a single isolation room, whenever possible. When single isolation rooms are unavailable or limited, we recommend cohorting patients with COVID-19 on dedicated wards or in dedicated hospitals. We also recommend that cases of suspected COVID-19 be cohorted separately from those with confirmed disease, whenever possible, to minimize the risk of patient-to-patient transmission in settings where confirmatory testing may be limited. We suggest that healthcare workers be designated to care exclusively for patients with COVID-19, whenever possible, as another approach to minimize nosocomial spread. This approach may also be beneficial in conserving limited supplies of reusable personal protective equipment (PPE). We recommend that visitors be restricted for patients with COVID-19. In settings where family members or visitors are necessary for caregiving, we recommend that the appropriate PPE be used by visitors.

METHODS A strategical literature search was performed on a various bibliographic database such as Scopus, PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, Medline, Google patent, Derwent Innovation, and Orbit Intelligence for retrieval of peerreviewed articles and patents on regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders over the past four decades or so. The relevant hits of articles and patents were analyzed and citation search for the relevant documents was carried out. RESULTS The literature documents have been summarized regarding the existing regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles on neuronal disorders with a focus on the detailed mechanism of developmental toxicity of nanoparticles. The focus of this report is to emphasize the negative effects of nanoparticle on neuronal disorders which may partially contribute to management of toxicity of nanoparticles. CONCLUSION Although nanoparticles have unique physical and chemical properties that explain the broad range of application for the central nervous system, they can also manifest neurotoxic effects due to cell necrosis, a generation of free radicals, immune responses and neuroinflammation. Thus, this review highlights on risk assessment, safety regulations and regulatory guidelines of nanoparticles which may reduce adverse reactions in humans and animals.","output":"Recent patents, regulatory issues, and toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims To survey the effect of COVID-19 on mental health of both medical professionals and the general population, as well as attitudes surrounding the disclosure of mental illness. Method An online survey comprised of two questionnaires, one for medical professionals and one for the general population, were conducted via social media. Both questionnaires asked respondents of the effect of COVID-19 on their mental health, and the former asked respondents about the effect of COVID-19 on their patient group's mental health. The questionnaires went on to ask respondents about their attitudes to mental health disclosure in various scenarios, to varying groups of people. The general population group was also asked how they would react if someone else disclosed their mental illness to them. Result The questionnaire for the medical professionals gained 62 respondents and the one for the general population had 122 respondents, with responses from multiple nations. Overall, COVID-19 has affected everyone's mental health to a degree, and all groups had reservations about disclosing their mental health issues to others. The medical professionals were especially reluctant to disclose mental illness to their patients, but were more comfortable when it came to disclosing mental illness to colleagues. The general population, however, was much more reluctant to disclose mental health issues to their colleagues. The general population were, on the whole, willing to listen to and help anyone who came to them with mental health concerns. Both groups surveyed showed reluctance toward disclosure to the wider community. Conclusion COVID-19 appears to significantly affect not only physical health, but mental health as well. There is at least some degree of stigma surrounding the disclosure of mental health issues. While most would be happy to help anyone who came to them with their mental health problems, there seems to be an attitude shift when people must contend with mental health issues of their own.","output":"Attitudes surrounding the disclosure of mental illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WiSE system is a novel, leadless endocardial system that can provide cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients who cannot be treated with a conventional epicardial left ventricular lead.

A total of 164 samples were collected weekly between February 19th and June 8th, 2021. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 47.2% (52/110) influent samples and 37% (20/54) effluent samples. The increasing percentage of positive influent samples correlated with the citys increasing active clinical cases during the second wave of COVID-19 in Jaipur. Furthermore, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) evidence clearly showed early detection of about 20 days (9/9 samples reported positive on April 20th, 2021) before the maximum cases and maximum deaths reported in the city on May 8th, 2021. The present study further observed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in treated effluents at the time window of maximum active cases in the city even after tertiary disinfection treatments of ultraviolet (UV) and chlorine (Cl(2)) disinfection. The average genome concentration in the effluents and removal efficacy of six commonly used treatments, activated sludge process + chlorine disinfection (ASP + Cl(2)), moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) with ultraviolet radiations disinfection (MBBR + UV), MBBR + chlorine (Cl(2)), sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and SBR + Cl(2), were compared with removal efficacy of SBR + Cl(2) (81.2%) > MBBR + UV (68.8%) > SBR (57.1%) > ASP (50%) > MBBR + Cl(2) (36.4%). The study observed the trends and prevalence of four genes (E, RdRp, N, and ORF1ab gene) based on two different kits and found that prevalence of N > ORF1ab > RdRp > E gene suggested that the effective genome concentration should be calculated based on the presence/absence of multiple genes. Hence, it is imperative to say that using a combination of different detection genes (E, N, RdRp, & ORF1ab genes) increases the sensitivity in WBE.

METHOD: This retrospective study analyzed 323 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients for co-infection rate and antimicrobial usage in the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC) from January 23rd to March 14th 2020. The microbiota composition was also investigated in patients with critically severe COVID-19. RESULTS: The total population co-infection rate was 17/323 (5.3%) and 0/229 (0), 4/78 (5.1%), and 13/16 (81.3%) for the mild, severe, and critically severe subgroups, respectively. Proven fungal infection was significantly associated with a higher mortality rate (p = 0.029). In critically severe patients, the rate of antimicrobials and carbapenem usage were 16/16 (100%) and 13/16 (81.3%), respectively, in which the preemptive and empiric antimicrobial days accounted for 51.6% and 30.1%, respectively. Targeted therapy only accounted for 18.3%. MS was implemented to detect non-COVID-19 virus co-existence and the semi-quantitative surveillance of bacteremia, with clear clinical benefit seen in cases with MS-based precision antimicrobial management. Airway microbiome analysis suggested that the microbiota compositions in critically severe COVID-19 patients were likely due to intubation and mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In the SPHCC cohort, we observed a non-negligible rate of super-infection, especially for the critically ill COVID-19 patients. Fungal co-infection requires intensive attention due to the high risk of mortality, and the clinical benefit of MS in guiding antimicrobial management warrants further investigation.","output":"Evaluation of superinfection, antimicrobial usage, and airway microbiome with metagenomic sequencing in COVID-19 patients: A cohort study in Shanghai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Deep general anesthesia has been associated with increased mortality in 5 observational studies. The association may be causal or an epiphenomenon due to increased anesthetic sensitivity in high-risk patients. We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of performing a definitive randomized controlled trial. The aims of the study were to determine whether anesthetic depth targeting in a high-risk group was feasible and to document anesthetic doses and arterial blood pressures associated with \\"deep\\" and \\"light\\" general anesthesia. METHODS ASA physical status III and IV patients, aged 60 years, having surgery lasting 2 hours, with expected hospital stay 2 days, and receiving general anesthesia were randomly allocated to a Bispectral Index (BIS) or spectral entropy (SE) target of 35 (\\"low\\" group) or 50 (\\"high\\" group). The primary end point was mean BIS or SE. Secondary end points were postanesthesia care unit length of stay and pain scores, quality of recovery score, hospital length of stay, postoperative complications, and death. A composite end point of postoperative complications (pneumonia, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, and death) was determined at 1 year. RESULTS One hundred twenty-five patients were recruited. The mean of the median BIS/SE values for each patient during the maintenance phase of anesthesia in the low and high groups was significantly different: 39 vs 48 (mean difference 8 [95% confidence interval {CI95}, 6 to 10], P < 0.001). There was also a significant difference in mean volatile anesthetic administration (minimum alveolar concentration): 0.98 vs 0.64 (mean difference -0.35 [CI95, -0.44 to -0.26], P < 0.001) and target propofol concentrations: 4.0 vs 3.1 g/mL (mean difference -0.8 [CI95, -1.2 to -0.3], P = 0.004). Intraoperative mean arterial blood pressures were similar (85 vs 87 mm Hg; mean difference 2 [CI95, -2 to 6], P = 0.86), and there were no differences in short-term recovery characteristics or hospital length of stay. There was a significant difference in the incidence of wound infection at 30 days (13% vs 3%; risk difference -10% [CI95, -21 to -0.1], P = 0.04). At 1 year, the composite rates of complications in the low and high groups were 28% and 17% (risk difference -11 [CI95, -25 to 4], P = 0.15) and mortality rates were 12% and 9%, respectively (risk difference -2 [CI95, -14 to 9], P = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS This pilot study demonstrated that depth of anesthesia targeting with BIS or SE was achievable in a high-risk population with adequate separation of processed electroencephalogram monitor targets.

However, data regarding the factors that predict care (and a lack of care) are scattered. This study systematically reviews biomedical literature within the Transactional Model of Physician Compassion and synthesizes evidence regarding the predictors of physician empathy, compassion, and related constructs (ECRC). METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, OvidJournals, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Scopus using search terms relating to ECRC and its predictors. Eligible studies included physicians as participants. Methodological quality was assessed based on the Cochrane Handbook, using ROBINS-I risk of bias tool for quantitative and CASP for qualitative studies. Confidence in findings was evaluated according to GRADE-CERQual approach. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two included studies (74,866 physicians) highlighted the diversity of influences on compassion in healthcare (54 unique predictors). Physician-related predictors (88%) were gender, experience, values, emotions and coping strategies, quality of life, and burnout. Environmental predictors (38%) were organizational structure, resources, culture, and clinical environment and processes. Patient-related predictors (24%) were communication ease, and physicians perceptions of patients motives; compassion was also less forthcoming with lower SES and minority patients. Evidence related to clinical predictors (15%) was scarce; high acuity presentations predicted greater ECRC. DISCUSSION: The growth of evidence in the recent years reflects ECRCs ongoing importance. However, evidence remains scattered, concentrates on physicians factors that may not be amenable to interventions, lacks designs permitting causal commentary, and is limited by self-reported outcomes. Inconsistent findings in the direction of the predictors effects indicate the need to study the relationships among predictors to better understand the mechanisms of ECRCs.

We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increases in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods.

These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis 1. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.2. Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from unscrupulous actors.3. With proper informed consent from patients or proxy when necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to conventional therapies.KEY WORDS: Coronavirus, COVID-19, cytokine storm, multiorgan failure, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.","output":"Expanded Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) as a Therapeutic Strategy in Managing Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: The Case for Compassionate Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Queenslands Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) suppression program has been relatively successful. Initially, it involved extensive community testing and repeat sampling of positive individuals for release from isolation. This enabled study of several characteristics, including persistence of detectable virus and how apparent viral clearance rates varied by age and sex. DESIGN We conducted an exploratory analysis of Queensland Pathology SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results. Kaplan Meier analyses were used to estimate median time to apparent viral clearance, and Cox regression to explore the effects of sex and age. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Individuals tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract between January 19 and June 4, 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES Presence of viral RNA detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS We analyzed 97,476 individuals. Median age was 41y (range <1-105y), and 57.2% (95% CI 57.2, 57.2) were female. In total, 958 (0.98%; 95% CI 0.92,1.05) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positivity rates were lower in regional areas than cities, in females (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70, 0.91), and in those aged 16y and below (p<0.01, test for trend). Of the 958 positive individuals, 243 had two or more (max 17) additional tests, and 92% (95% CI 88.1, 95.2) remained positive after 10 days (max 76 days) after the initial result. Median time to apparent viral clearance was longer in those 65y and over compared to those under 65y (29 v 43 days, HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.17, 2.90), and was unaffected by sex (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.66, 1.30). CONCLUSIONS Females and those 16y and under were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Detectable RNA may persist for long periods, negating the value of repeat testing for declaring individuals free of infection. Viral clearance rates appear lower in those over 65y of age compared with younger individuals.","output":"Repeat testing for SARS-COV-2: Persistence of viral RNA is common, and clearance is slower in older age groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the quality of videos for retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) on YouTube (Google, LLC) from the perspective of both patients and physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All videos longer than 2 minutes returned by the YouTube search engine in response to the keyword search retrograde intrarenal surgery were included in this study. The quality of content was analyzed by using the validated Journal of the American Medical Association Benchmark Score (JAMAS) and the Global Quality Score (GQS). Two surgeons developed the RIRS Scoring System (RIRSSS) to evaluate the technical quality of the videos. A video power index (VPI) was used to score the popularity of the videos. RESULTS: A total of 63 videos with a median of 389 views were included in the present study. Forty-three videos (68.3%) were provided by health care professionals and 53 videos (84.1%) included technical aspects about RIRS. The median (interquartile range) GQS, JAMAS, RIRSSS, and VPI scores were 2 (1C3), 1 (1C2), 2 (1C5), and 0.41 (0.08C1.29), respectively. Videos with audio had significantly higher GQS and RIRSSS scores than did with videos with no audio (p<0.001, p=0.039, respectively). The GQS of videos providing general information about RIRS was higher, whereas RIRSSS scores were higher for videos detailing technical aspects (p=0.027, p=0.038, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The quality of YouTube videos containing information about RIRS evaluated in this study was very low.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a register-based study over public health data collected, organized, and maintained by the Ministry of Health covering the Brazilian population. METHODS: We evaluated the Brazilian notifications of positively tested cases for SARS-CoV-2 who have succumbed or not to COVID-19 between February 26th to September 7th of 2020 at the city, state, and national scales for conformity to expected distribution provided by Benford's law (BL). RESULTS: Statistical analyzes demonstrated a significant rejection of SARS-CoV-2 notification cases at the city and the number of deaths by COVID-19 in all regional levels according to the hypothesis of conformity to BL. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated by BL, which has been widely applied to query the quality and reliability of different numerical data sources, the misreporting number of cases and deaths throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Brazil. Therefore, we brought to light pieces of evidence that raise questions about the reliability of SARS-CoV-2 data in Brazil.

However, 1 - 2 per million 15C19-year-old Caucasian patients will also develop nasal SCC. This case reports a rare finding of a 19-year-old Caucasian male with nasal SCC. METHOD: Medical records were used to access to all relevant clinical notes for the patient, including blood results, clinical documentation, imaging, and histology. The patients clinical journey was reviewed from initial referral to the ENT department to diagnosis with non-keratinising squamous cell carcinoma (NKSCC) stage IV b. Progression of disease: The patient was initially referred to ENT with unilateral tinnitus and temporal headache and diagnosed in clinic with glue ear and hypertrophic adenoidal tissue. He was due to have grommets and EUA, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of clinical suspicion of SCC. Patient was later seen in ED for epistaxis, and then for neck swelling after which he was diagnosed with SCC.

This sequencing is used to select targeted therapy and monitor nonresponding or progressive tumors to identify mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Our study objective was to review available coverage policies for cancer ctDNA-based testing panels to examine trends from 2015 to 2019. METHODS: We analyzed publicly available private payer policies and Medicare national coverage determinations and local coverage determinations (LCDs) for ctDNA-based panel tests for cancer. We coded variables for each year representing policy existence, covered clinical scenario, and specific ctDNA test covered. Descriptive analyses were performed. RESULTS: We found that 38% of private payer coverage policies provided coverage of ctDNA-based panel testing as of July 2019. Most private payer policy coverage was highly specific: 87% for non-small cell lung cancer, 47% for EGFR gene testing, and 79% for specific brand-name tests. There were 8 final, 2 draft, and 2 future effective final LCDs (February 3 and March 15, 2020) that covered non-FDA-approved ctDNA-based tests. The draft and future effective LCDs were the first policies to cover pan-cancer use. CONCLUSIONS: Coverage of ctDNA-based panel testing for cancer indications increased from 2015 to 2019. The trend in private payer and Medicare coverage is an increasing number of coverage policies, number of positive policies, and scope of coverage. We found that Medicare coverage policies are evolving to pan-cancer uses, signifying a significant shift in coverage frameworks. Given that genomic medicine is rapidly changing, payers and policymakers (eg, guideline developers) will need to continue to evolve policies to keep pace with emerging science and standards in clinical care.","output":"Private Payer and Medicare Coverage for Circulating Tumor DNA Testing: A Historical Analysis of Coverage Policies From 2015 to 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning is becoming increasingly promi- nent in healthcare. Although its benefits are clear, growing attention is being given to how machine learning may exacerbate existing biases and disparities. In this study, we introduce an adversarial training framework that is capable of mitigating biases that may have been acquired through data collection or magnified during model development. For example, if one class is over-presented or errors/inconsistencies in practice are reflected in the training data, then a model can be biased by these. To evaluate our adversarial training framework, we used the statistical definition of equalized odds. We evaluated our model for the task of rapidly predicting COVID-19 for patients presenting to hospital emergency departments, and aimed to mitigate regional (hospital) and ethnic biases present. We trained our framework on a large, real-world COVID-19 dataset and demonstrated that adversarial training demonstrably improves outcome fairness (with respect to equalized odds), while still achieving clinically-effective screening performances (NPV>0.98). We compared our method to the benchmark set by related previous work, and performed prospective and external validation on four independent hospital cohorts.

METHODS: A secondary data analysis of select indicators on infectious diseases and nutritional disorders in seven Northeastern states across three rounds of the National Family Health Survey (2005C06, 2015C16, 2019C20) was undertaken. We calculated outcome indicator mean prevalence, relative change and average annual rates of reduction of the indicators. RESULTS: A significant relative reduction between 2006C2020 in the prevalence of diarrhoea (0.4 [95CI:0.7,0.1]) at p < 0.05; acute respiratory illness (ARI) (0.7 [95CI:0.1,0.4]), stunting (0.3 [95CI: 0.3,0.12]) and underweight (0.3 [95CI:0.5,0.2]) at p < 0.001 were noted. However, overweight prevalence increased (10.1[95CI:4.3,16.0, p < 0.001]) due to a low annual reduction rate.

The mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains unclear. Methods: We investigated the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 at maternal-fetal interface in pregnant women who tested positive for the virus using RNA in situ hybridization (viral RNA), immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. To investigate whether viral infection alters the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in placenta which controls blood pressure, we treated human trophoblasts with recombinant Spike protein or a live modified virus with a vesicular stomatitis viral backbone expressing Spike protein (VSV-S). Findings: Viral colonization was highest in maternal decidua, fetal trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, and in placentas delivered prematurely. We localized SARS-CoV-2 to cells expressing Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and demonstrate that infected placentas had significantly reduced ACE2. In response to both Spike protein and VSV-S, cellular ACE2 decreased while Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) increased with concomitant increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1(sFlt1). Viral infection decreased pro-angiogenic factors, AT2R and Placental growth factor, which competitively binds to sFlt1. Sera from infected pregnant women had elevated levels of sFlt1 and Angiotensin II type 1-Receptor Autoantibodies prior to delivery, both signatory markers of preeclampsia. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 colonizes ACE2-expressing maternal and fetal cells in the placenta. Infection in pregnant women correlates with alteration of placental RAS. As RAS regulates blood pressure, SARS-CoV-2 infection may thus increase adverse hemodynamic outcomes such as preeclampsia in pregnant women.

In this article, we explore the issue of blame and stigma in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. We do so by studying editorial cartoons published about COVID-19 in ten mainstream Canadian newspapers between January 2020 and March 2021. We identified 203 editorial cartoons that highlight common discourses which blame or stigmatize specific groups of people for the origin or transmission of COVID-19, or for their behavior during the pandemic. The cartoons focused on four groups: 1) people of Chinese origin or descent and of other national/geographic provenance (Americans, Canadians from specific provinces, urban residents); 2) international travelers; 3) people who do not respect the preventive measures to contain the pandemic; and 4) people who question or criticize the scientific discourses about COVID-19. Our analysis revealed an othering process common in times of pandemic. Our analysis of editorial cartoons in Canada also uncovered a moralization around the respect of the counter measures against COVID-19. These editorial cartoons largely divide the population into two groups: 1) virtuous people who are selfless and smart and who respect the public health preventive measures; 2) those who are immoral, self-centered, silly and even stupid, who do not respect the recommended measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. While negatively portraying these individuals may help promote adherence to the recommended measures, it also can exacerbate polarization. Analyzing editorial cartoons can be a useful approach to rapidly gather information on attitudes and feelings in the public at a specific time and place.","output":"Stigma and blame related to COVID-19 pandemic: A case-study of editorial cartoons in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A commentary on Humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in Iceland.","output":"Significant reduction of humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 4 months after the diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable transport modes, particularly micro-mobility, allows to reduce possible congestion phenomena in urban traffic. In this study, the aim is to make a contribution to increase micro-mobility use by exploring the impacts of socio-demographic, vehicle ownership (car, bicycle and micro mobility), level of infrastructure service and road users perception in safety, comfort and chaotic environment on renting micro-mobility in a shared urban street. The study area is a historical center called Via Maqueda in Palermo, Italy, which is rich in commercial and cultural activities. A survey with 200 individuals is carried out for the data collection regarding the aim of the study. The analysis starts with a descriptive statistics in order to illustrate the characteristics of the predictor variables. This is followed by relaxing p-value method for selecting the statistically significant predictor variables with 90% confidence level. These selected predictor variables are applied into an ordinal logit model. The results suggest that one unit increase in car ownership decrease the willingness of renting a micro mobility by log odds of ?0.74, given all the other predictors are held constant. One unit increase in age group decrease the willingness of renting micro-mobility in shared urban streets. The outcomes will guide decision makers to understand who the average road users are and what are their needs in terms of further developments of the micro-mobility system in urban shared streets.

We report the clinical features and treatment of a Chinese renal transplant recipient with COVID-19. A 46-year-old Chinese woman, who had a renal transplant in 2006 due to chronic glomerulonephritis, was admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University for fever, cough, and expectoration for more than 10 days and diarrhea for 3 days. At admission, her body temperature was 38.2  and pulse oxygen saturation was 96% under oxygen inhalation. There were decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Laboratory data revealed normal leucocyte count, a normal percentage of neutrophils, a normal percentage of lymphocytes, decreased lymphocyte count, elevated procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased levels of urea, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. COVID-19 was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab and sputum which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Chest CT revealed multiple patchy and flake ground-glass shadows in bilateral lung fields, and strip shadows in bilateral lower lobes. Treatment included antiviral (umifenovir, hydroxychloroquine), antibacterial (moxifloxacin), and other support therapies. Her symptoms, laboratory data, and chest CT showed trends of gradual improvement, while nasopharyngeal swabs were always positive for SARS-CoV-2. She was finally discharged from hospital on her 70th day of hospitalization when 2 consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of lung ultrasound in COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients in predicting clinical course and outcome. METHODS: We analyzed lung ultrasound score (LUS) of all COVID-19 patients admitted from March 2020 to December 2020 to the Internal Intensive Care Unit, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) of Munich. LU was performed according to a standardized protocol at ICU admission and in case of clinical deterioration with the need for intubation. A normal lung scores 0 points, the worst LUS has 24 points. Patients were stratified in a low (0C12 points) and a high (13C24 points) lung ultrasound score group. RESULTS: The study included 42 patients, 69% of them male. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (81%) and obesity (57%). The values of pH (7.42  0.09 vs 7.35  0.1; p = 0.047) and p(a)O(2) (107 [80C130] vs 80 [66C93] mmHg; p = 0.034) were significantly reduced in patients of the high LUS group. Furthermore, the duration of ventilation (12.5 [8.3C25] vs 36.5 [9.8C70] days; p = 0.029) was significantly prolonged in this group. Patchy subpleural thickening (n = 38; 90.5%) and subpleural consolidations (n = 23; 54.8%) were present in most patients. Pleural effusion was rare (n = 4; 9.5%). The median total LUS was 11.9  3.9 points. In case of clinical deterioration with the need for intubation, LUS worsened significantly compared to baseline LU. Twelve patients died during the ICU stay (29%). There was no difference in survival in both LUS groups (75% vs 66.7%, p = 0.559). CONCLUSIONS: LU can be a useful monitoring tool to predict clinical course but not outcome of COVID-19 ICU patients and can early recognize possible deteriorations.

In fact, despite a large body of scientific evidence, health and regulatory authorities still require direct proof of this mode of transmission. To close this gap, we measured the saliva viral load of SARS-CoV-2 of an infected subject located in a hospital room, as well as the airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the room resulting from the person breathing and speaking. As the next step, we simulated the same scenarios to estimate the concentration of RNA copies in the air through a novel predictive theoretical approach. Finally, we conducted a comparative analysis (i.e. a metrological compatibility analysis) of the differences between the experimental and theoretical results by estimating the uncertainties of these two approaches. Our results showed that for an infected subject's saliva load ranging between 2.4x106 and 5.5x106 RNA copies mL-1, the corresponding airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration was not detectable when the person was breathing, but was 16.1 (with an uncertainty of 32.8) RNA copies m-3 when speaking. The application of the novel predictive estimation approach provided average concentrations of 3.2 (uncertainty range of 0.2-8.3) and 18.5 (uncertainty range of 4.5-43.0) RNA copies m-3 for breathing and speaking scenarios, respectively, thus confirming that for the breathing scenario, the airborne RNA concentration would be undetectable, being below the minimum detection threshold of the experimental apparatus (< 2 RNA copies m-3).","output":"Link between SARS-CoV-2 emissions and airborne concentrations: closing the gap in understanding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we propose a broad conceptual model that incorporates social capital dimensions and problem-solving routines to understand the determinants behind hotel managements perception of and ability to cope with the COVID-19 pandemicand thus, to innovate their service offering We provide empirical support for the notion that, due to uncertainty about reopening after lockdown, the hospitality sector has found existing problem-solving routines to be of little use Although the local community has been unable to form a shared vision around the pandemic, hoteliers have nevertheless relied on their network of relationships to sense the crisis and find their own ways to adapt Interestingly, we find that overreliance on trustworthy relationships can diminish the ability to sense a crisis objectively Our results not only shed light on sensemaking in the hotel industry, but also grapple with the theoretical nature of sensemaking as a socially constructed process","output":"Sensing the virus.

The currently developed programs use the so-called progressive approach to efficiently obtain a constrained alignment of several sequences. However, the kernels of these programs, the dynamic programming algorithms for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, run in (n(2)) memory, where  is the number of the constraints and n is the maximum of the lengths of sequences. As a result, such a high memory requirement limits the overall programs to align short sequences~only. Results: We adopt the divide-and-conquer approach to design a memory-efficient algorithm for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, which greatly reduces the memory requirement of the dynamic programming approaches at the expense of a small constant factor in CPU time. This new algorithm consumes only (n) space, where  is the sum of the lengths of constraints and usually  ? n in practical applications. Based on this algorithm, we have developed a memory-efficient tool for multiple sequence alignment with constraints.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from outpatients visiting general geriatric hospital frailty clinics. Bone mineral density (BMD) and muscle mass were measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporosis was defined as a BMD of < 70% of the young adult mean, according to the Japan Osteoporosis Society. Sarcopenia was diagnosed as per the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 recommendation. Osteosarcopenia was defined as the co-existence of osteoporosis and sarcopenia. We defined social frailty using a questionnaire comprising four items: general resources, social resources, social behavior, and basic social needs. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed with social frailty status and osteosarcopenia as the dependent and independent variables, respectively. RESULTS: We included 495 patients (mean age = 76.5  7.2 years) in the analysis; of these, 58.2% were robust and 17.2%, 13.5%, and 11.1% had osteoporosis alone, sarcopenia alone, and osteosarcopenia, respectively.

Beyond the most common clinical features of COVID-19, mainly represented by respiratory symptoms, other systems may be interested by the infection. Among these, through a neurotropic pathway, the central nervous system (CNS) may be affected by the virus, leading to developing neuropsychiatric symptoms. Particularly, this study focuses on neurological symptoms determined by the Sars-CoV-2 infection, as well as on the underlying pathogenetic processes.

Results: We display the most significant neurological clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Common neurological manifestations (ageusia, anosmia, and encephalitis) are first described. Subsequently, we provide a focus on delirium and its possible pathogenetic and clinical correlates. Delirium is not only a possible resultant of the COVID-19 neurotropism, but it may also be precipitated by a number of environmental factors that assume further relevance during the pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, due to lapses in harm reduction services, several public health experts forecasted subsequent increases in diagnosis of HIV in PWUD. As many inpatient hospitals reworked patient flow during the COVID-19 surge, we hypothesized that HIV testing in PWUD would decrease. To answer this question, we compiled a deidentified list of hospitalized patients with electronic medical record indicators of substance usea positive urine toxicology screen, prescribed medications to treat opioid use disorder, a positive CIWA score, or a positive CAGE scoreadmitted between January, 2020 and August, 2020. The outcome of interest was HIV test completion during inpatient hospitalization. The study used logistic regression to examine associations between type of substance use and receipt of HIV test. The study grouped substance use type into four groups (1) opioids (oxycodone, fentanyl, or other opiates) or opioid use disorder treatments (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone); (2) stimulant use (cocaine or amphetamines); (3) alcohol use (presence of a positive CAGE or CIWA score or alcohol present on toxicology screen); and (4) benzodiazepine use (benzodiazepines present on toxicology screen). The proportion of PWUD who were tested for HIV increased from 10.4% in January, 2020 to 28.2% in April, 2020 and back down to 12% in August.

METHODS: Fish were collected using multi-panel gill nets. The gills of each fish were washed and examined for copepods using a stereo microscope. The copepods found were stored in 70% ethanol, cleared in lactic acid, and mounted in Hoyer's medium. Drawings were made with the aid of a microscope equipped with a drawing tube. RESULTS: The new copepod species can be distinguished from its two congeners, Rhinergasilus piranhus (type-species) Boeger et Thatcher, 1988 and Rhinergasilus digitus Narciso, Brand?o, Perbiche-Neves et Silva, 2020, due to its extremely long antennary claw (etymology of the species), being longer than the other antennary segments; third leg lacking any interpodal plate; and third endopodal segment of third leg lacking a distal spine. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the morphological differences, we erected a new species of Rhinergasilus.

To maintain energy supplies in the tissues, neutrophils consumed extracellular proteins to fuel central carbon metabolism. The physiological stresses of hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, characteristic of inflamed tissues, promoted this extra-cellular protein scavenging with activation of the lysosomal compartment further driving exploitation of the protein rich inflammatory milieu.

We previously developed the interactive, livestreaming, group-based, Moving TogetherTM program for PWML and their caregivers (CGs). This study assesses feasibility, satisfaction, and qualitative outcomes in four groups that participated during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: We assessed feasibility based on number of participants and attendance. We administered an online survey at the end of the 12-week program to assess satisfaction. The survey included a 6-item Class Experience scale (e.g., feeling accepted, energized) and the 4-item PROMIS Social Isolation scale, both using 4-point Likert response scales. Open-ended questions asked about changes noticed in themselves and others during the program. We used a previously established coding scheme informed by a biopsychosocial framework to code free-text survey responses and refined codes as we identified new concepts. RESULTS: We offered four 12-week class series (1 hour, 2 days/week) from April to July 2020 that included 8 to 14 participants each (total N=39: 24 PWML, 15 CGs). Average attendance was 78% (range: 58% to 98%). Surveys were sent to 31 participants who completed the program, of whom 25 (16 PWML, 9 CGs) responded. Nearly all respondents reported that they often, mostly or always felt acceptance and well-being during classes (6-items, 88% to 100%), and most reported that they rarely or never felt social isolation (4 items, 50% to 100%). Qualitative analyses of free-text responses identified self-reported improvements in both PWML and CGs in several areas: 1) emotional well-being, including better mood, lower stress, and increased relaxation;2) social connection, such as friendship and camaraderie;3) physical function, including more energy, increased activity, improved movement, and increased mind-body awareness;and 4) cognitive function such as better focus. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the interactive, livestreaming, group-based, Moving TogetherTM program is feasible and associated with high satisfaction among both PWML and their CGs.

Attempts to predict the structure, growth rates and properties of emerging crystals have been frustrated, in part, by the poor understanding of the correlations between the oligomeric state of the solute, the growth unit, and the crystal symmetry. To explore how a solute monomer or oligomer is selected as the unit that incorporates into kinks and how crystal symmetry impacts this selection, we combine scanning probe microscopy, optical spectroscopy, and all-atom molecular simulations using as examples two organic materials, olanzapine (OZPN) and etioporphyrin I (EtpI). The dominance of dimeric structures in OZPN crystals has spurred speculation that the dimers preform in the solution, where they capture the majority of the solute, and then assemble into crystals. By contrast, EtpI in crystals aligns in parallel stacks of flat EtpI monomers unrelated by point symmetry. Raman and absorption spectroscopies show that solute monomers are the majority solute species in solutions of both compounds. Surprisingly, the kinetics of incorporation of OZPN into kinks is bimolecular, indicating that the growth unit is a solute dimer, a minority solution component. The disconnection between the dominant solute species, the growth unit, and the crystal symmetry is even stronger with EtpI, for which the (010) face grows by incorporating monomers, whereas the growth unit of the (001) face is a dimer. Collectively, the crystallization kinetics results with OZPN and EtpI establish that the structures of the dominant solute species and of the incorporating solute complex do not correlate with the symmetry of the crystal lattice. In a broader context, these findings illuminate the immense complexity of crystallization scenarios that need to be explored on the road to the understanding and control of crystallization.","output":"Precrystallization solute assemblies and crystal symmetry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lockdown, compounded by a deep economic slump, threatens to push thousands of people into homelessness Here, Astrup explores this shifting landscape and asks what happens next","output":"Crisis round the Corner?: the Journal of the Health Visitors' Association"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metabolic profiling in COVID-19 patients has been associated with disease severity, but there is no report on sex-specific metabolic changes in discharged survivors.

In contrast, the outcome of infection in Group 2 was dramatically different; 17/27 (63%) of cats lost a median of 51.3% of their bodyweight (P < 0.0005) and died during the study period, with lymphoma being the most common cause of mortality. Although the decrease in CD4+ T cell count between enrolment and terminal disease was significant (P = 0.0017), the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of enrolment did not reliably distinguish FIV-positive cats classified as healthy and not healthy at either cohort. FIV load at enrolment was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (P < 0.0001), but there were no significant differences at enrolment between healthy and not healthy cats at either group. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that management and housing conditions impact on disease progression and survival times of FIV-positive cats.","output":"Contrasting clinical outcomes in two cohorts of cats naturally infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We developed and evaluated a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detecting Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).

The JEV RT-LAMP was highly specific, which no cross-reactivity was found with dengue-2 virus, rabies virus, norovirus, astrovirus and human enterovirus 71. The JEV RT-LAMP assay was more simple and less time-consuming compared to the conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR, which the amplification could be completed in a single tube within 1 h under isothermal conditions at temperature of 63C.

We conducted a quality improvement (QI) initiative to reduce potentially avoidable PICU admissions of children with DKA without increasing endocrinology ward-to-PICU transfers. METHODS: A survey of providers demonstrated opportunities to increase awareness of institutional criteria for PICU admissions of children with DKA. We created an electronic health record (EHR) dot-phrase, prepopulated with these criteria, and placed a note in the EHR for all patients with DKA as a reference for all providers. An EHR-based data report was created to monitor the disposition of DKA patients and the use of the dot-phrase (process measure). The primary outcome measure was the potentially avoidable PICU admissions for patients with DKA. Endocrinology ward-to-PICU transfers were tracked as a balancing measure to ensure safe disposition. RESULTS: After the implementation of the dot-phrase, use was variable, but averaged 33.4% over 1 year. The percentage of DKA admissions classified as potentially avoidable PICU stays decreased from 4.1% to 0.5%, with a concurrent decrease in the total percentage of PICU admissions for DKA from 19.1% to 8.4%. The percentage of endocrinology ward-to-PICU transfers also declined from 0.8% to 0%. CONCLUSIONS: A novel EHR-based intervention increasing awareness and documentation of established pediatric DKA management guidelines can be used to safely reduce PICU admissions for DKA without increasing the rate of endocrinology ward-to-intensive care unit transfers.","output":"Improving Disposition Decision-Making for Pediatric Diabetic Ketoacidosis: A Quality Improvement Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION TAPP inguinal hernia repair (IHR) entails the development of a peritoneal flap (PF) in order to reduce the hernia sac and create a preperitoneal space in which to place mesh. Many methods for closure of the PF exist including sutures, tacks, and staples. We hypothesized that patients who had PF closure with suture would have better short-term QOL outcomes. METHODS AND PROCEDURES A prospective institutional hernia-specific database was queried for all adult, TAPP IHRs from July 2012 to August 2013. Unilateral and bilateral patients were included and each hernia was analyzed separately. The main outcome of interest was quality of life (QOL) at two- and four-week follow-up, as measured by the Carolinas Comfort Scale. RESULTS There were 227 patients who underwent TAPP, with 99 bilateral and 128 unilateral IHR, for a total of 326 IHR. PF closure was performed using tacks in 45.1%, suture in 19.0%, and staples in 35.9%. Patient characteristics were statistically similar between the tack, suture, and staple group. There were 32.9% direct, 46.5% indirect, and 20.6% pantaloon hernias, which were not significantly different when compared by PF closure method. Post-operative complications and length of stay were same for the three groups. There were no hernia recurrences. Post-operative activity limitation at two weeks was significantly better in the suture group when compared to the stapled group (p = 0.005). Additionally, sutured PF closure had less early post-operative pain when compared to the tack group (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS Following TAPP IHR, suture closure of the PF significantly improves 2-week post-operative movement limitation compared to stapled and tacked PF closure. Continued randomized studies are needed to determine the best surgical hernia repair methods for ideal post-op QOL.","output":"Tacks, staples, or suture: method of peritoneal closure in laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair effects early quality of life."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visualizations are an important part of anatomical education and appear in all software on the market.

A sequential timing of relaxing restrictions across groups is explored in order to identify policies that simultaneously reduce health risks and economic stagnation relative to current policies. The goal will be to mitigate health risks, particularly among the most fragile sub-populations, while also managing the deleterious effect of restrictions on economic activity. The results of this paper show that a properly constructed sequential release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing protocols can lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all individuals after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of minimizing overall death rate, must be sequential in nature, and it is important to properly time each step of the staggered release. This model allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies, which can provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and planning of disease management policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks.","output":"Staggered Release Policies for COVID-19 Control: Costs and Benefits of Sequentially Relaxing Restrictions by Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 triggered mass innovation that grew flexible learning modalities and pathways that can be built upon in future sector plans to make education systems more resilient.

Our objective was to confirm the prediction accuracies of the RCFT-copy and CDT for cognitive impairment (CI) using convolutional neural network algorithms as a screening tool. METHODS: The CDT and RCFT-copy data were obtained from patients aged 60C80 years who had more than 6 years of education. In total, 747 CDT and 980 RCFT-copy figures were utilized. Convolutional neural network algorithms using TensorFlow (ver. 2.3.0) on the Colab cloud platform (www.colab.research.google.com) were used for preprocessing and modeling. We measured the prediction accuracy of each drawing test 10 times using this dataset with the following classes: normal cognition (NC) vs. mildly impaired cognition (MI), NC vs. severely impaired cognition (SI), and NC vs. CI (MI + SI). RESULTS: The accuracy of the CDT was better for differentiating MI (CDT, 78.04  2.75; RCFT-copy, not being trained) and SI from NC (CDT, 91.45  0.83; RCFT-copy, 90.27  1.52); however, the RCFT-copy was better at predicting CI (CDT, 77.37  1.77; RCFT, 83.52  1.41). The accuracy for a 3-way classification (NC vs. MI vs. SI) was approximately 71% for both tests; no significant difference was found between them. CONCLUSIONS: The two drawing tests showed good performance for predicting severe impairment of cognition; however, a drawing test alone is not enough to predict overall CI. There are some limitations to our study: the sample size was small, all the participants did not perform both the CDT and RCFT-copy, and only the copy condition of the RCFT was used.

Current and emerging PHSs use either a centralized database, peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, or distributed ledger technology for PHS deployment. The evolving COVID-19 decentralized Bluetooth-based tracing systems are examples of disease-centric P2P PHSs. Although using P2P technology for the provision of PHSs can be flexible, scalable, resilient to a single point of failure, and inexpensive for patients, the use of health information on P2P networks poses major security issues as users must manage information security largely by themselves. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the inherent security issues for PHS deployment in P2P networks and how they can be overcome. In addition, this study reviews different P2P architectures and proposes a suitable architecture for P2P PHS deployment. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. We searched the following databases: IEEE Digital Library, PubMed, Science Direct, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar. The search was conducted on articles published between 2008 and 2020. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System was used as a guide for rating security issues. RESULTS: Our findings are consolidated into 8 key security issues associated with PHS implementation and deployment on P2P networks and 7 factors promoting them. Moreover, we propose a suitable architecture for P2P PHSs and guidelines for the provision of PHSs while maintaining information security. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the clear advantages of P2P PHSs, the absence of centralized controls and inconsistent views of the network on some P2P systems have profound adverse impacts in terms of security. The security issues identified in this study need to be addressed to increase patients intention to use PHSs on P2P networks by making them safe to use.","output":"Security Engineering of Patient-Centered Health Care Information Systems in Peer-to-Peer Environments: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this study was to systematically review the published data on dengue virus (DENV) seroprevalence in Sudan and to estimate disease burden through meta-analysis.

Critically ill patients often require prolonged intubation for mechanical ventilation to support breathing; thus, the artificial airway must be managed by tracheotomy. Therefore, studies exploring appropriate and safe methods for tracheotomy that minimize the risks of nosocomial transmission are important. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of 14 critically ill patients with COVID-19, who underwent bedside tracheotomy from March to April 2020 was conducted to summarize the indications for tracheotomy and key points related to personal protective equipment and surgical procedures. RESULTS: All 14 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were critically ill. All tracheotomies were performed in the late phase of the infection course. The interval between the infection and tracheotomy was 33 days, and the median interval between intubation and tracheotomy was 25.5 days. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results of secretions from the operative incision and inside the tracheotomy tube were negative. Twelve patients improved after tracheotomy, with SpO(2) levels maintained above 96%. One patient died of progressive respiratory failure; another patient died of uncontrolled septic shock. No medical staff who participated in the tracheotomy was infected. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheotomy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who meet the indications for tracheotomy potentially represents a safer approach to manage the airway and help improve the treatment outcomes. A tracheotomy performed in the late phase of the disease has a relatively low risk of infection. Adherence to key steps in the tracheotomy procedure and donning adequate personal protection will help medical staff avoid infection.","output":"Safety and efficacy of tracheotomy for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan: a case series of 14 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose/Objective(s) The current COVID-19 (COVID) pandemic has presented many challenges to the treatment of cancer patients. Radiation therapy departments were forced to create new operational workflows that permitted the monitoring of patient's COVID status during continued treatment; while simultaneously protecting the oncology care team. Radiation therapy planning process involves a very complex hand-off workflow between highly skilled care team professionals. The time between initiation of planning and first treatment is critical for optimal treatment outcomes. Insertion of pre-screening of COVID status prior to initiation of therapy could have considerable impact on the overall time between the initiation of planning and initiation of treatment. Our department CT SIM to treatment time average the four months prior to COVID was 8.9 days. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of our departmental COVID screening process and its effect on the safe delivery of radiation therapy. Further, we investigated if the insertion of a COVID screening process would have a negative impact on the total time to start. Materials/Methods Operational workflow changes were set in place to pre-screen all patients prior to the initiation of radiation therapy. Patients presenting with COVID symptoms after initial clearance, were subjected to additional round of COVID testing. These patients were placed in the sequestered protocol until cleared. UT Health San Antonio School of Nursing, with the help of grant supplied by Hyundai, provided COVID testing for all our patients. Quality assurance tracking mechanisms were put into place to track COVID testing and results. COVID positive patients were treated in a clinically sequestered protocol. Positive results were subjected to contact tracing. Results Data were collected from April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. During this time period, a total of 684 patients underwent COVID testing. A total of 679 patients tested negative. Five patients identified as COVID positive. A total of 18 sequestered radiation treatments were delivered. During the study timeframe a total of 4 care team members tested positive for COVID. All patient and care team contact tracing indicated source of infection was encountered outside of the treatment setting. Average time from initiation of CT simulation order to the resulting of COVID testing was 7.08 days. Average simulation to initiation of treatment during this time period was a total time was 7.7 days an improvement of 1.2 days. Conclusion With appropriate protocols and team vigilance; continued delivery of radiation therapy to cancer patients can be achieved. These protocols did not affect the overall time to initiate treatment.

Some very low death rate settings such as Eastern Asia, Central Europe, the Balkans and Africa have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented foods whose intake is associated with the activation of the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) anti-oxidant transcription factor. There are many Nrf2-interacting nutrients (berberine, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, quercetin, resveratrol, sulforaphane) that all act similarly to reduce insulin resistance, endothelial damage, lung injury and cytokine storm. They also act on the same mechanisms (mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin, PPAR?3:Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, NF&#954;B: Nuclear factor kappa B, ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases and eIF2&#945;:Elongation initiation factor 2&#945;). They may as a result be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, acting through the endoplasmic reticulum stress or ACE-Angiotensin-II-AT1R axis (AT1R) pathway. Many Nrf2-interacting nutrients are also interacting with TRPA1 and/or TRPV1. Interestingly, geographical areas with very low COVID-19 mortality are those with the lowest prevalence of obesity (Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia). It is tempting to propose that Nrf2-interacting foods and nutrients can re-balance insulin resistance and have a significant effect on COVID-19 severity.

We aimed to evaluate NEWS2 for the prediction of severe COVID-19 outcome and identify and validate a set of blood and physiological parameters routinely collected at hospital admission to improve upon the use of NEWS2 alone for medium-term risk stratification. METHODS: Training cohorts comprised 1276 patients admitted to King's College Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust with COVID-19 disease from 1 March to 30 April 2020. External validation cohorts included 6237 patients from five UK NHS Trusts (Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, University Hospitals Southampton, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals, University Hospitals Birmingham), one hospital in Norway (Oslo University Hospital), and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). The outcome was severe COVID-19 disease (transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death) at 14 days after hospital admission. Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) measured at hospital admission were considered in the models. RESULTS: A baseline model of 'NEWS2 + age' had poor-to-moderate discrimination for severe COVID-19 infection at 14 days (area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in training cohort = 0.700, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.680, 0.722; Brier score = 0.192, 95% CI 0.186, 0.197). A supplemented model adding eight routinely collected blood and physiological parameters (supplemental oxygen flow rate, urea, age, oxygen saturation, C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) improved discrimination (AUC = 0.735; 95% CI 0.715, 0.757), and these improvements were replicated across seven UK and non-UK sites. However, there was evidence of miscalibration with the model tending to underestimate risks in most sites. CONCLUSIONS: NEWS2 score had poor-to-moderate discrimination for medium-term COVID-19 outcome which raises questions about its use as a screening tool at hospital admission. Risk stratification was improved by including readily available blood and physiological parameters measured at hospital admission, but there was evidence of miscalibration in external sites.

Our study demonstrates the impact of host TTSPs on infection of SARS-CoV-2, which may have implications for cell and tissue tropism, for pathogenicity, and potentially for vaccine development.","output":"TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13 Activate the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most common human corona viruses cause common colds. But three of these viruses cause more serious, acute diseases; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS by MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2. The current outbreak was classified by the WHO as a global public health emergency. Despite all efforts to reduce the surgical lists and to cancel or postpone non-time-critical surgical interventions, some surgical and anesthetic interventions outside of intensive care medicine are still necessary and must be performed. This is particularly true for obstetric interventions and neuraxial labor analgesia. Workload in the delivery room is presumably not going to decrease and planned cesarean sections cannot be postponed. In the meantime, the clinical course and outcome of some COVID-19 patients with an existing pregnancy or peripartum courses have been reported. There are already numerous recommendations from national and international bodies regarding the care of such patients. Some of these recommendations will be summarized in this manuscript. The selection of aspects should by no means be seen as a form of prioritization. The general treatment principles in dealing with COVID-19 patients and the recommendations for action in intensive care therapy also apply to pregnant and postpartum patients. In this respect, there are naturally considerable redundancies and only a few aspects apply strictly or exclusively to the cohort of obstetric patients. In summary, at present it must be stated that the general care recommendations that also apply to non-COVID-19 patients are initially valid with regard to obstetric anesthesia. Nevertheless, the special requirements on the part of hygiene and infection protection result in special circumstances that should be taken into account when caring for pregnant patients from an anesthetic point of view. These relate to both medical aspects, but also to a particular extent logistics issues with regard to spatial separation, staffing and material resources.","output":"Geburtshilfliche An?sthesie w?hrend der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie: bersicht der Handlungsempfehlungen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, nudging has become a standard behavioral intervention at the individual level and for thedesign of social policies.

Despite the fact that spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins together wrap up the SARS-CoV-2 virion, most of the reported pseudotype viruses consist of only the S protein. Here, we report that the presence of E and M increased the virion infectivity by promoting the S protein priming. The S, E, and M (SEM)-coated pseudovirion is spherical, containing crown-like spikes on the surface. Both S and SEM pseudoviruses packaged the same amounts of viral RNA, but the SEM virus bound more efficiently to cells stably expressing the viral receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (hACE2) and became more infectious. Using this SEM pseudovirus, we examined the infectivity and antigenic properties of the natural SARS-CoV-2 variants. We showed that some variants have higher infectivity than the original virus and that some render the neutralizing plasma with lower potency. These studies thus revealed possible mechanisms of the dissemination advantage of these variants. Hence, the SEM pseudovirion provides a useful tool to evaluate the viral infectivity and capability of convalescent sera in neutralizing specific SARS-CoV-2 S dominant variants.","output":"Small Structural Proteins E and M Render the SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus More Infectious and Reveal the Phenotype of Natural Viral Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe our experiences with organizing pro bono medical genetics and neurology outreach programs on several different resource-limited islands in the West Indies.

But no studies to date have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results. METHODS: Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020. Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Of 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results and 90 (21.5%) had liver injury during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than 3 the upper limit of normal, respectively. Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19C6.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93C10.23, respectively). The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with abnormal liver tests were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease. The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which should be monitored and evaluated frequently. LAY SUMMARY: Data on liver tests in patients with COVID-19 are scarce. We observed a high prevalence of liver test abnormalities and liver injury in 417 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our referral center, and the prevalence increased substantially during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests and liver injury were associated with the progression to severe pneumonia. The detrimental effects on liver injury were related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which warrants frequent monitoring and evaluation for these patients.","output":"COVID-19: Abnormal liver function tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors regret to inform that the of the article was missed to be submitted.

The unavailability of virus-specific drugs has created an opportunity to identify potential therapeutic agents that can control the rapid transmission of this pandemic. Here, the mechanisms of the inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), responsible for the replication of the virus in host cells, are examined by different ligands, such as Remdesivir (RDV), Remdesivir monophosphate (RMP), and several artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs) including their different sequences by employing molecular docking, MD simulations, and MM/GBSA techniques. It is found that the binding of RDV to RdRp may block the RNA binding site. However, RMP would acquire a partially flipped conformation and may allow the viral RNA to enter into the binding site. The internal dynamics of RNA and RdRp may help RMP to regain its original position, where it may inhibit the RNA-chain elongation reaction. Remarkably, AEGISs are found to obstruct the binding site of RNA. It is shown that dPdZ, a two-nucleotide sequence containing P and Z would bind to RdRp very strongly and may occupy the positions of two nucleotides in the RNA strand, thereby denying access of the substrateCbinding site to the viral RNA. Thus, it is proposed that the AEGISs may act as novel therapeutic candidates against the SARS-CoV-2. However, in vivo evaluations of their potencies and toxicities are needed before using them against COVID-19.","output":"Artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGISs) as potent inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In order for physical distancing directives to be effective at lowering and flattening the epidemic peak during a pandemic, individuals must adhere to confinement guidelines.

Level of HCF was selected based on the WHO recommendation for implantation of tuberculosis (TB) molecular diagnostics. PARTICIPANTS: Using implementation of TB diagnostics as a model, we purposively selected participants (TB patients, carers, survivors, healthcare practitioners, community members, opinion leaders and policy-makers) based on their role as stakeholders. In-depth interviews, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were held to collect the data between 2016 and 2018.

Socioeconomic and cultural factors such as poverty, stigma and inadequate knowledge about causes of disease and available remedies, cultural beliefs were associated with low access and utilisation of diagnostic and treatment tools for TB. Poverty made people hesitate to seek formal healthcare resulting in delayed diagnosis and resorting to self-medication and cheap herbal alternatives. Fear of stigma made people hide their sickness and avoid reporting for follow-up treatment visits. Inadequate knowledge and beliefs were fertile ground for aggravated stigma and believing that diseases like TB are caused by spirits and thus cured by spiritual rituals or religious prayers.

This directly impacts the student engagement and immersion that are necessary for conceptual and procedural understanding for scientific experimentation. While online and remote laboratories have potential to address the aforementioned challenges, theoretical perspectives of laboratory learning outcomes are critical to enhance their impact and are sparsely examined in the literature. Using Transactional Distance Theory (TDT), this paper addresses the gap through a case study on Universal Testing Machine (UTM). By comparing physical (PL-UTM) and remotely triggerable (RT-UTM) laboratory platforms, the structure and interactions as per TDT are analysed. Characterization of interactivity between remote learners and instructors disclose indicative parameters that affect transactional distances and aid in conceptual understanding in remote laboratory learning environment. An extensive pedagogical study through development of two instruments towards assessing conceptual understanding and perception of platform effectiveness that was conducted both on physical laboratory and RT-UTM showed: (1) remote users conducted experiments 3 times more frequently (2) completed assignments in 30% less time and (3) had over 200% improvement in scores when RT-UTM platform was integrated into mainstream learning.

Accordingly, mice have been used as a model for mammalian development and studied extensively to infer human biology based on the conservation of fundamental processes between the two species. As research has progressed, however, species-specific differences in characteristics between rodents and primates have become apparent. Non-human primates (NHPs) have also been used for biomedical research, and are now attracting attention as a model for human development. Here, we summarize primate species from the evolutionary and genomic points of view. Then we review the current issues and progress in gene modification technology for NHPs. Finally, we discuss recent studies on the early embryogenesis of primates and future perspectives.","output":"Non-human primates as a model for human development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The knowledge about enteric viral infection has vastly increased over the last eight years due to the development of intestinal organoids and enteroids that suppose a step forward from conventional studies using cell lines. Intestinal organoids and enteroids are three-dimensional (3D) models that closely mimic intestinal cellular heterogeneity and organization. The barrier function within these models has been adapted to facilitate viral studies. In this review, several adaptations (such as organoid-derived two-dimensional (2D) monolayers) and original intestinal 3D models are discussed. The specific advantages and applications, as well as improvements of each model are analyzed and an insight into the possible path for the field is given.","output":"Put Some Guts into It: Intestinal Organoid Models to Study Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were registered in Kabardino-Balkar Republic (KBR) in the end of March 2020, when Hospital No 1 at the Center for AIDS and Infectious Diseases was completely equipped for the admission of COVID-19 patients. Objective. To assess clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with severe and extremely severe COVID-19 treated in the intensive care unit of Hospital No 1 in Nalchik in 2020-2021. Patients and methods. A total of 283 patients were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) during this year. More that one-third of patients (41.3%) died;most of them were male. The majority of patients in the ICU were between 61 and 70 years of age;the majority of deaths were registered among patients aged 71 to 80 years. One hundred and seventy-three individuals in the ICU required non-invasive or invasive ventilation;105 of them (60.7%) died. Two hundred and fifty-two patients (89%) had severe concomitant diseases. The disease severity was also determined by advanced lung damage (more than 50%) in 143 patients (50.5%). Patients were examined and treated in accordance with temporary guidelines (effective at that time). Results. The most common causes of death among patients treated for COVID-9 in the ICU were pulmonary embolism (n=50;42.75%), sepsis (n=19;16.2%), and acute respiratory failure (n=17;14.5%). ? 2021, Dynasty Publishing House.

Bantis syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by splenomegaly, ascites, and portal hypertension without coexisting cirrhosis of the liver. Here we report a case of a 32-year-old man who presented with hematemesis, and further workup revealed that the patient had bleeding varices, ascites, and splenomegaly, thus completing the picture of Bantis syndrome. Although this is a rare disorder, Banti's syndrome must be taken into account in a patient presenting with hematemesis and splenomegaly. The patient had flu-like symptoms for three weeks but did not seek any medical help and eventually presented with Banti's syndrome. His serology was positive for COVID-19. The coronavirus (COVID-19), discovered in 2019, has been creating havoc since it first emerged in China and is now spreading worldwide. Its presentation is somewhat similar to influenza.","output":"COVID-19 Presenting as Banti's Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A new stain of corona virus COVID-19 got worldwide attention and has affected almost whole of the world population. Currently there is no specific vaccine or drug against COVID-19. Xu et al. (2020) built a homolog model of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro based on SARS-CoV Mpro which is considered as target to inhibit the replication of CoV. OBJECTIVE: The aim of current study is to find potential inhibitors of COVID-19 Mpro using docking analysis. METHODS: Autodockvina was used to carry out Protein-Ligand docking. COVID-19 main protease Mpro was docked with catechin and its different synthetic derivatives. Nelfinavir is an antiretroviral drug belongs to protease inhibitors was taken as standard. RESULTS: According to the result obtained it was found that Compound (4) and Compound (1) have more affinity than nelfinavir. CONCLUSION: Compounds have a great potential to become COVID-19 main protease Mpro inhibitor.
