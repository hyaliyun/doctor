Recently, vitamin D levels were found to be lower than normal and sometimes deficient in malignant nodules of the thyroid. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the relationship between the serum vitamin D levels and benign thyroid nodules in euthyroid patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Tertiary care center in Turkey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred to the general surgery outpatient clinic and diagnosed with thyroid nodules were the study group. The control group consisted of healthy individuals without thyroid nodules. Age, BMI, thyroid ultrasonography, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, free T3, free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, total protein, albumin, glucose, creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were compared between groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels and size of the thyroid nodules. SAMPLE SIZE AND CHARACTERISTICS: Of 849 individuals, 453 were patients with thyroid nodules and 396 were healthy individuals. RESULTS: The mean serum vitamin D levels of patients with thyroid nodules were significantly lower than controls (P<.001). Serum vitamin D levels along with serum total protein levels and eGFR were independent variables associated with the presence of a thyroid nodule (P<.001, p=.005 and P=.017, respectively).

The etiology of PLRO is still unclear. We aimed to share our experience regarding management and follow-up of patients with PLRO who were effectively treated. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this case series, we presented 10 patients who were diagnosed with PLRO and treated from January 2010 to December 2020. VAS scale and laboratory findings were evaluated. Spinal and extremity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained for patients with spinal and extremity pains. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was used for the measurement of bone mineral density. Values assessed on dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were L1-L4 T score, L2-L4 T score and femoral neck T score. RESULTS In the first-month follow-ups, all patients had meaningful pain relief and symptom resolution. The mean duration of pain control during the treatment period was 2.4 months. Two patients who continued breastfeeding were also the patients whose pain control was achieved at the latest. One patient required vertebroplasty surgery. CONCLUSION Patients with PLRO should be promptly treated and followed-up. Discontinuation of breastfeeding will provide rapid advantage and should be the first step of the management. Early diagnosis and treatment of Calcium and Vitamin D with conservative procedures with spinal braces are very important for the treatment of PLRO patients. Additionally, bisphosphonates or teriparatide can improved the bone mineral density in patients with PLRO.","output":"Management of Pregnancy- and Lactation-Related Osteoporosis: Case Series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Managerial preparedness is a constant concern for firm stakeholders.

Our results, based off of corporate filings with the SEC, is that airline management had multiple dry runs before the COVID-19 outbreak that should have lead them to prepare for financially catastrophic scenarios such as the one observed in 2020. Instead, management teams failed to learn from these, and other, prior shocks.

Although family caregivers currently capture information through nondigital methods, digital health care applications are a promising solution for supporting the standardization of information management in complex home care across their childs health care team. However, family caregivers continue to use paper-based methods where the adoption of digital health care tools is low. With the rise in home care for children with complex health care needs, it is important to understand the caregiving work domain to inform the design of technologies that support child safety in the home. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore how family caregivers navigate information management and communication in complex home care for CSHCN. METHODS: This research is part of a broader study to explore caregivers perspectives on integrating and designing digital health care tools for complex home care. The broader study included interviews and surveys about designing a voice user interface to support home care. This formative study explored semistructured interview data with family caregivers of CSHCN about their home care situations. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the information management and communication processes. RESULTS: We collected data from 7 family caregivers in North America and identified 5 themes. First, family caregivers were continuously learning to provide care. They were also updating the caregiver team on their childs status and teaching caregivers about their care situation. As caregiving teams grew, they found themselves working on communicating with their childrens educators. Beyond the scope of managing their childs health information, family caregivers also navigated bureaucratic processes for their childs home care. CONCLUSIONS: Family caregivers experiences of caring for CSHCN differ contextually and evolve as their childs condition changes and they grow toward adulthood. Family caregivers recorded information using paper-based tools, which did not sufficiently support information management. They also experienced significant pressure in summarizing information and coordinating 2-way communication about the details of their childs health with caregivers. The design of digital health care systems and tools for complex home care may improve care coordination if they provide an intuitive method for information interaction and significant utility by delivering situation-specific insights and adapting to unique and dynamic home care environments. Although these findings provide a foundational understanding, there is an opportunity for further research to generalize the findings.","output":"Exploring the Experiences of Family Caregivers of Children With Special Health Care Needs to Inform the Design of Digital Health Systems: Formative Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Powered flight has evolved several times in vertebrates and constrains morphology and physiology in ways that likely have shaped how organisms cope with infections. Some of these constraints likely have impacts on aspects of immunology, such that larger fliers might prioritize risk reduction and safety. Addressing how the evolution of flight may have driven relationships between body size and immunity could be particularly informative for understanding the propensity of some taxa to harbor many virulent and sometimes zoonotic pathogens without showing clinical disease. Here, we used a scaling framework to quantify scaling relationships between body mass and the proportions of two types of white blood cells--lymphocytes, and granulocytes (neutr-/heterophils)--across 60 bat species, 414 bird species, and 256 non-volant mammal species. By using phylogenetically-informed statistical models on field-collected data from wild Neotropical bats, data gleaned from other wild bats available in the literature, and data from captive non-volant mammals and birds, we show that lymphocyte and neutrophil proportions do not vary systematically with body mass among bats. In contrast, larger birds and non-volant mammals have disproportionately higher granulocyte proportions than expected for their body size. Future comparative studies of wild bats, birds, and non-volant mammals of similar body mass should aim to further differentiate evolutionary effects and other aspects of life history on immune defense. Summary statement Powered flight might constrain morphology such that certain immunological features are prioritized. We show that bats largely have similar cell proportions across body mass compared to strong allometric scaling relationships in birds and non-flying mammals.","output":"Body size affects immune cell proportions in birds and non-volant mammals, but not bats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted researchers to conduct non-randomized studies in an effort to find an off-label drug that can effectively combat the virus and its effects.

Anesthetic depth monitoring in these patients can be difficult due to their already altered mental state prior to anesthesia. In this study, the utility of electroencephalographic indexes to reflect anesthetic depth was evaluated in pediatric patients with ID. Methods Seventeen patients (mean age, 9.6  2.9 years) scheduled for dental procedures were enrolled in this study. After anesthesia induction with propofol or sevoflurane, a bilateral sensor was placed on the patient's forehead and the bispectral index (BIS) was recorded. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, which was adjusted according to the clinical signs by an anesthesiologist blinded to the BIS value. The index performance was accessed by correlation (with the end-tidal sevoflurane [EtSevo] concentration) and prediction probability (with a clinical scale of anesthesia). The asymmetry of the electroencephalogram between the left and right sides was also analyzed. Results The BIS had good correlation and prediction probabilities (above 0.5) in the majority of patients; however, BIS was not correlated with EtSevo or the clinical scale of anesthesia in patients with Lennox-Gastaut, West syndrome, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. BIS showed better correlations than SEF95 and TP. No significant differences were observed between the left- and right-side indexes.

METHODS Consecutive adult patients admitted to the ICU were included if they were deeply sedated and mechanically ventilated for <48 h without any spontaneous breathing activity. Subjects were classified as having normal lungs, COPD, or ARDS. Respiratory mechanics variables were collected once per subject. Static compliance was calculated as the ratio between tidal volume and driving pressure. Inspiratory resistance was measured by the least-squares fitting method. The expiratory time constant was estimated by the tidal volume/flow ratio. RESULTS Of the 359 subjects included, 138 were classified as having normal lungs, 181 as ARDS, and 40 as COPD. Median (interquartile range) static compliance was significantly lower in ARDS subjects as compared with normal lung and COPD subjects (39 [32-50] mL/cm H2O vs 54 [44-64] and 59 [43-75] mL/cm H2O, respectively, P < .001). Inspiratory resistance was significantly higher in COPD subjects as compared with normal lung and ARDS subjects (22 [16-33] cm H2O/L/s vs 13 [10-15] and 12 [9-14] cm H2O/L/s, respectively, P < .001).

METHODS A questionnaire was distributed to physicians, nurses, and EMRs attending conferences on SARS in the summer of 2003. Questions related to information sources, knowledge of SARS, and plans implemented in their workplace to deal with it. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (10.1 Program, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). RESULTS A total of 201 community healthcare providers (HCPs) participated in the study. A total of 51% of the participants correctly identified the incubation period of SARS; 48% correctly identified the symptoms of SARS; and 60% knew the recommended infection control precautions to take for families. There was little difference in knowledge among the physicians, nurses, and EMRs evaluated. Media outlets such as newspapers, journals, television, and radio were reported as the main sources of information on SARS.

The aim of the study is a comprehensive assessment of the approach to the definition of the individuals\` residence in the Russian financial law, which allows to make a conclusion about the feasibility and prospects for its reform. The article examines various aspects of the current legal regulation in this area, as well as the features of recognition of individuals as tax residents in accordance with the international agreement on the avoidance of double taxation have been investigated. The advantages of the existing approach can be attributed to its simplicity and certainty, which is associated with the use of only one objective criterion C the period of stay in the country. In such conditions, it is not difficult for tax agents and tax authorities to classify taxpayers as tax residents. This greatly simplifies administration and allows citizens themselves to better understand their status and associated rights and responsibilities. Paradoxically, this feature is also the lack of regulation. Since, in fact, it completely gives tax residency to the power of the citizens themselves, primarily the wealthy. The simplicity of its definition makes it possible to practically freely change the Russian tax jurisdiction to another, depending on personal benefit. As a result, the state is unable to levy taxes on the income of persons who de facto have close personal and economic ties with the Russian jurisdiction, but de jure do not meet the formal characteristics of a tax resident, planning in advance the period of their stay in Russia. The simplicity in establishing the tax residency of the Russian Federation allows taxpayers to practically freely change the Russian tax jurisdiction to another, depending on personal gain. As a result, the state is unable to levy taxes on the income of persons who de facto have close personal and economic ties with the Russian jurisdiction, but de jure do not meet the formal characteristics of a tax resident, planning in advance the period of their stay in Russia. The article analyzes the main approaches to determining the residence of individuals used in world practice, as well as the measures taken by various states to avoid abuse of the right by individuals. Particular attention is paid to the study of tax residence as a key condition for the implementation of the international agreement on the exchange of information on financial accounts (CRS MCAA), since unfair manipulation of tax status can also impede the state financial control. It is also interesting to study the issue of determining the residence of individuals in the context of the COVID?19 virus pandemic, since the cancellation of transport links between countries for a long period of time may be forced to change the tax status of many people. As a result of the research, the author came to the conclusion that the approach to determining the tax residence of individuals in Russia differs from that used in most developed countries and needs some resemblance with global practice. In particular, the introduction of the concept of a center of vital interests into Russian legislation will allow considering the connection of a person with Russian jurisdiction on an individual basis, excluding the possibility of abuse. ? 2021, Russian Academy of Sciences.

This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA). Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring. This COVID-19 Cerebellum Task Force consensus provides some guidance on how we may approach this uncertain time and consider preparing for the new realities we face in CA patient care once this acute crisis has passed.","output":"Management of Patients with Cerebellar Ataxia During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Current Concerns and Future Implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antibody point-of-care tests (POCTs) (Abbott Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM and Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody tests) and compared the results to their respective chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) (Abbott Architect IgM, Architect IgG, Roche Cobas total antibody assays). METHOD: 200 pre-pandemic sera and 48 samples positive for various conditions (18 viral hepatitis, 18 dengue, 11 ANA and 1 dsDNA) were used as controls and to assess for cross-reactivity. Anonymised residual leftover sera positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR were recruited as cases (n=133). The sensitivity/specificity/cross-reactivity/positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV) of the POCTs were assessed. Concordance between the POCTs and chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) were analysed. RESULTS: Abbott/Roche POCT specificity was 98.7%/100% (95% CI 96.5-99.8/98.5-100) and sensitivity was 97.2%/97.2% (95% CI 85.5-99.9/85.5-99.9) in cases 14 days post-first positive RT-PCR (POS), PPV was 68.7%/100% (95% CI 41.3-87.2/94.7-100.0), and NPV was 97.4%/97.6% (95% CI 97.0-97.8/97.2-98.0).

OBJECTIVES: To study APACHE II scores in patients of acute kidney injury (AKI) admitted in the ICU and to find its association with outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients with AKI aged 18 years or above were admitted in the ICU, department of general medicine, of a tertiary care institute in Haryana, North India, from October 2019 to September 2020, were studied. Patients who had known causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD), on maintenance hemodialysis, and those who underwent renal replacement therapy (RRT) or nephrectomy were excluded. All required investigations were performed, and data were collected. The patients were followed till discharge or in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 55.92  18.18 years. MaleCfemale ratio was 1.5:1. Thirty-five percent of the admitted patients had an in-hospital mortality. Sepsis (47%) was the most common cause of AKI, and 83% of the patients had underlying comorbid conditions. The mean APACHE II score of the expired patients on admission, i.e., 24.80  13.65, was found to be significantly higher compared to the mean APACHE II score (17.25  10.12) of the discharged patients (p-value <0.001).

The assessment was limited to public laboratories found within the Thai Bureau of Quality and Safety of Food, National Institute of Health and regional medical science centres. METHODS The World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory assessment tool was adapted to Thailand through a participatory approach. This adapted version employed a specific scoring matrix and comprised 16 modules with a quantitative output. Two teams jointly performed the on-site assessments in December 2010 over a two-week period, in 17 public health laboratories in Thailand. The assessment focused on the capacity to identify and accurately detect pathogens mentioned in Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) in a timely manner, as well as other public health priority pathogens for Thailand. RESULTS Performance of quality management, budget and finance, data management and communications was considered strong (>90%); premises quality, specimen collection, biosafety, public health functions, supplies management and equipment availability were judged as very good (>70% but 90%); while microbiological capacity, staffing, training and supervision, and information technology needed improvement (>60% but 70%). CONCLUSIONS This assessment is a major step in Thailand towards development of an optimized and standardized national laboratory network for the detection and reporting of infectious disease that would be compliant with IHR (2005).

METHODS: We reviewed all respiratory virus PCR tests performed on adult patients with a history of solid organ (SOT) or stem cell transplantation (HSCT) during the 2012C2013 influenza season. The positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of ILI criteria were calculated. RESULTS: Of 126 transplant patients (66 HSCT, 60 SOT), 54 (42.8%) tested positive for an RVI by PCR: 24 influenza and 30 non\\\\influenza.

METHODS Prospective, monocentric, observational study including patients with an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube and a history of mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours without delirium, and inadequate nonverbal communication skills. The ICU patients' pain was assessed with a numeric rating scale (NRS), their mood was tested with a smiley analogue scale (SAS). Quality of life and self-esteem were measured with the European quality of life-5 dimensions-5 levels-score (EQ-5D-5L) and the visual analogue self-esteem scale (VASES). RESULTS A total of 75 patients with a mean age of 58.3 years were included. Main diagnoses for ICU admission were major trauma (45.3%), non-abdominal sepsis (22.6%), and acute abdomen (13.3%). Patients showed moderate levels of pain and sadness with a median of 4 [interquartile range (IQR): 3-5.5] on the NRS and a median of 4 [IQR: 3-4] on the SAS. The general health status on the EQ-5D-5L was rated as poor.

In the neuropediatric rehabilitation field evidence of the effectiveness of this modality of assistance and data about provider and family's perceptions are scarce. Objective: To evaluate the characteristics of telerehabilitation physical therapy consultations for children with neurological diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and report the perceptions of physical therapists about this modality of assistance. Methods: An online survey was created and administered to Brazilian neuropediatric physical therapists. The survey consisted of demographics data, questions about the characteristics of telerehabilitation consultations, and physical therapists' perception of telerehabilitation assistance. Results: From July to September 2020, 394 physical therapists responded to the questionnaire. The most of them took 21 to 30 minutes per telemonitoring session (26.9%), offered one session per week (61.0%), and used electronic messages as the main method of delivery (39.9%). The main difficulty reported was caregivers' lack of understanding about handling during sessions (41.2%) and problems with internet connection (16.7%).

The surface of the influenza virus is covered with hemagglutinin (HA) proteins that can form multiple interactions with sialic acid-terminated glycans on the host cell surface. This multivalent binding affects the selectivity of the virus in ways that cannot be predicted from the individual receptorCligand interactions alone. Here, we show that the intrinsic structural and energetic differences between the interactions of avian- or human-type receptors with influenza HA translate from individual site affinity and orientation through receptor length and density on the surface into virus avidity and specificity. We introduce a method to measure virus avidity using receptor density gradients. We found that influenza viruses attached stably to a surface at receptor densities that correspond to a minimum number of approximately 8 HACglycan interactions, but more interactions were required if the receptors were short and human-type. Thus, the avidity and specificity of influenza viruses for a host cell depend not on the sialic acid linkage alone but on a combination of linkage and the length and density of receptors on the cell surface. Our findings suggest that threshold receptor densities play a key role in virus tropism, which is a predicting factor for both their virulence and zoonotic potential.","output":"Hierarchical Multivalent Effects Control Influenza Host Specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic had clear impacts on mental health. Social media presents an opportunity for assessing mental health at the population level. OBJECTIVES: 1) Identify and describe language used on social media that is associated with discourse about depression. 2) Describe the associations between identified language and COVID-19 incidence over time across several geographies. METHODS: We create a word embedding based on the posts in Reddits /r/Depression and use this word embedding to train representations of active authors. We contrast these authors against a control group and extract keywords that capture differences between the two groups. We filter these keywords for face validity and to match character limits of an information retrieval system, Elasticsearch. We retrieve all geo-tagged posts on Twitter from April 2019 to June 2021 from Seattle, Sydney, Mumbai, and Toronto. The tweets are scored with BM25 using the keywords. We call this score rDD. We compare changes in average score over time with case counts from the pandemics beginning through June 2021. RESULTS: We observe a pattern in rDD across all cities analyzed: There is an increase in rDD near the start of the pandemic which levels off over time. However, in Mumbai we also see an increase aligned with a second wave of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are concordant with other studies which indicate that the impact of the pandemic on mental health was highest initially and was followed by recovery, largely unchanged by subsequent waves. However, in the Mumbai data we observed a substantial rise in rDD with a large second wave. Our results indicate possible un-captured heterogeneity across geographies, and point to a need for a better understanding of this differential impact on mental health.","output":"Quantifying depression-related language on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This executive summary of a national living guideline aims to provide rapid evidence based recommendations on the role of drug interventions in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The guideline makes use of a systematic assessment and decision process using an evidence to decision framework (GRADE) as recommended standard WHO (2021). Recommendations are consented by an interdisciplinary panel. Evidence analysis and interpretation is supported by the CEOsys project providing extensive literature searches and living (meta-) analyses. For this executive summary, selected key recommendations on drug therapy are presented including the quality of the evidence and rationale for the level of recommendation. RESULTS: The guideline contains 11 key recommendations for COVID-19 drug therapy, eight of which are based on systematic review and/or meta-analysis, while three recommendations represent consensus expert opinion. Based on current evidence, the panel makes strong recommendations for corticosteroids (WHO scale 5C9) and prophylactic anticoagulation (all hospitalized patients with COVID-19) as standard of care. Intensified anticoagulation may be considered for patients with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolisms (VTE) and a low bleeding risk. The IL-6 antagonist tocilizumab may be added in case of high supplemental oxygen requirement and progressive disease (WHO scale 5C6). Treatment with nMABs may be considered for selected inpatients with an early SARS-CoV-2 infection that are not hospitalized for COVID-19. Convalescent plasma, azithromycin, ivermectin or vitamin D(3) should not be used in COVID-19 routine care. CONCLUSION: For COVID-19 drug therapy, there are several options that are sufficiently supported by evidence.

Conventional prediction of thermal sensation relies on population models, which do not satisfy the requirements of modeling an individual. Developing a model for individuals opens the door to control personalized microclimates. The COVID-19 pandemic has normalized the wearing of face masks;however, their comfort is variable and subjective. We embedded wearable sensors into a face mask to monitor heart rate, skin temperature, and exhalation temperature, determining factors in thermal sensation. Skin temperature, through its thermoregulatory mechanism, plays a vital role in regulating body temperature. As heart rate and exhalation temperature change with metabolic activity, they can predict these temperature changes. During our experiments, we collected physiological and psychological data from human participants at various room temperatures. From this, we found skin temperature and exhalation temperature to show a significant (p < 0.05) positive correlation with perceived thermal sensation. We also developed a random forest classification model for each participant to assess the accuracy of our modeling. We found that smart face masks present a nonintrusive method of measuring physiological data relevant to developing individualized thermal-sensation prediction models, which can be used to improve comfort in indoor environments. The mask we developed could also be adapted further to measure respiration rate, monitor activity, and record other physiological data.","output":"Prediction of individual thermal sensation from exhaled breath temperature using a smart face mask"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Een influenza-infectie ontwikkelt zich jaarlijks opnieuw bij ongeveer 20% van de wereldbevolking.

The ethanol extract of Pueraria lobatae Radix (EPL) was chosen as the model drug. A series of porous EPL particles were prepared by co-spray drying EPL with different amounts of ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), and their powder properties (particle morphology, particle size, porosity, flowability, bulk density, and tap density) and tablet properties (tensile strength, E sp, yield pressure, dissolution, etc.) were comparatively investigated. The results showed that there were significant differences in the fundamental and functional properties of the spray-dried and parent EPLs. First, the irregular and dense primary EPL particles were transformed into loose, hollow, and spheroidal particles via co-spray drying with NH4HCO3. Second, compared to parent EPL, porous EPLs showed a significant improvement (1.80-7.03 times) in compactibility. Third, the dissolution rates of porous EPLs were similar, and all were more than twice as fast as that of parent EPL. The increased porosity, on the one hand, led to the increase in interparticle and intraparticle bonding forces during tableting and, on the other hand, facilitated water intrusion into tablets for disintegration and dissolution. Porous particle design is therefore promising, especially for drugs with both poor compactibility and dissolution.","output":"Development on porous particles of Pueraria lobatae Radix for improving its compactibility and dissolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of health crises disease situation awareness is critical in the prevention and containment of the disease.

AIM: To generate a person-centered description of the impact of COVID-19 from the perspectives of patients living with neurodegenerative disease and caregivers to improve outpatient palliative care delivery. DESIGN: This qualitative study used rapid analysis via matrix design to identify emergent themes related to participant perspectives on the challenges of COVID-19. Data sources included semi-structured interviews, open-ended survey responses, medical record documentation and participant-researcher communications. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Data was collected from 108 patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease or related disorders and 90 caregivers enrolled in a multicenter, clinical trial of community-based, outpatient palliative care between March 20, 2020 and August 8, 2020 (NCT03076671). RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: (1) disruptions to delivery of healthcare and other supportive services; (2) increased symptomatic and psychosocial needs; (3) increased caregiver burden; (4) limitations of telecommunications when compared to in-person contact. We observed that these themes interacted and intersected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and caregivers have unmet care needs because of the pandemic, exacerbated by social isolation. While telemedicine has helped improve access to healthcare, patients and caregivers perceive clear limitations compared to in-person services.

However, there is a paucity of data on treatment durability and long-term outcomes. OBJECTIVES To provide long-term data on patients with a complete response to IL-2 therapy for ITM. METHODS Consecutive patients with ITM, treated with intralesional IL-2 therapy, at the Tom Baker Cancer Center were identified from April 2009 to August 2019. All patients received at least 4 cycles (every 2 weeks) of IL-2 (5 MIU/mL). Complete response was defined as sustained (ie, 3 months) clinical complete remission of all known in-transit disease. RESULTS Sixty-five patients were treated with curative intent for in-transit disease with intralesional IL-2. Complete clinical response was identified in 44.6% (29/65). In this subset of patients, the median number of lesions per patient was 9 (range 1-40). The median total dose of IL-2 was 0.8 mL (IQR 0.4-1.5) per lesion. One patient received isolated limb infusion and 13.8% (4/29) received systemic immunotherapy as part of their initial management. At a median follow-up of 27 months (IQR 16-59), 34.5% (10/29) developed recurrent disease. Of these patients, 50.0% (5/10) presented with synchronous in-transit and distant metastases.

OBJECTIVE: This integrated review examines the scientific evidence pertaining to the effectiveness of VRS and its practical usefulness in training health care professionals for in-hospital disaster preparedness. METHODS: A well-known 4-stage methodology was used for the integrated review process. It consisted of problem identification, a literature search and inclusion criteria determination, 2-stage validation and analysis of searched studies, and presentation of findings. A search of diverse publication repositories was performed. They included Web of Science (WOS), PubMed (PMD), and Embase (EMB). RESULTS: The integrated review process resulted in 12 studies being included. Principle findings identified 3 major capabilities of VRS: (1) to realistically simulate the clinical environment and medical practices related to different disaster scenarios, (2) to develop learning effects on increased confidence and enhanced knowledge acquisition, and (3) to enable cost-effective implementation of training programs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the integrated review suggested that VRS could be a competitive, cost-effective adjunct to existing training approaches. Although the findings demonstrated the applicability of VRS to different training scenarios, these do not entirely cover all disaster scenarios that could happen in hospitals.

Children aged 0C59 months with signs of severe pneumonia will be recruited by LHWs during routine visits in both intervention and control arms after consent. Severe pneumonia will be defined as fast breathing and/or chest in-drawing, and, one or more danger sign and/or hypoxaemia (Sa02 <92%) in PO (intervention) group and fast breathing and/or chest in-drawing and one or more danger sign in clinical signs (control) group. Recruits in both groups will receive a stat dose of oral amoxicillin and referral to designated tertiary health facility. Analysis of variance will be used to compare baseline referral acceptance in both groups with that at end of study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Review Committee of the Aga Khan University (4722-Ped-ERC-17), Karachi. Study results will be shared with relevant government and non-governmental organisations, presented at national and international research conferences and published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.

However, the complex structure of siamenoside I has hindered its production in various ways. Here, a yeast cell that produces a specific ?-glucosidase for siamenoside I conversion from mogroside V was constructed, and the enzymes were coelectrospun with polyvinyl alcohol followed by phenylboronic acid crosslinking to provide potential usage in the batch production process of S I. A central composite design-response surface methodology (CCD-RSM) was used to find the optimum coelectrospinning parameters. The pH stability and sodium dodecyl sulfate tolerance increased for the entrapped enzymes, and positive correlations between the fiber diameter and enzymatic activity were confirmed. The batch process showed an average siamenoside I production rate of 118  0.08 mg L-1 h-1 per gram of fiber.

Hence, nonprofit organizations may be interested in preventing negative consequences of these volunteers exposure to potentially traumatic events. The aim of this cross-sectional study was twofold. First, to examine to what extent self-compassion and self-determination would contribute to differentiating between volunteers with different levels of compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and post-traumatic growth. Second, to identify the best predictors of the most extreme levels of each outcome. Participants were 211 Spanish Red Cross volunteers (60.7% women), who completed a survey. They were separately classified into three groups (low, medium, and high) according to the 33rd and 66th percentile scores on each outcome (compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and post-traumatic growth). Univariate analyses of variance and post-hoc comparisons revealed that self-compassion and self-determination contributed differently to distinguishing between levels of each outcome. Volunteers lowest in compassion fatigue stood out for showing fewer non-compassionate strategies and more mindfulness than the other groups. Moreover, those higher in satisfaction compassion also showed lower use of unhealthy strategies and higher scores in all other predictive variables. Volunteers highest in post-traumatic growth showed higher self-kindness and satisfaction of all psychological needs. Binary logistic regressions allowed for the identification of predictors of belonging to the most extreme groups. The protective factors may be useful to guide volunteers self-care and help them thrive in the face of critical service demands.","output":"Volunteers compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and post-traumatic growth during the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in Spain: Self-compassion and self-determination as predictors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a newly discovered member of the Bunyaviridae family, is the causative agent of an emerging hemorrhagic fever, SFTS, in China. Currently, there are no vaccines or effective therapies against SFTS. In this study, a combinatorial human antibody library was constructed from the peripheral lymphocytes of 5 patients who had recovered from SFTS. The library was screened against purified virions for the production of single-chain variable-region fragments (ScFv). Of the 6 positive clones, one clone (monoclonal antibody [MAb] 4-5) showed neutralizing activity against SFTSV infection in Vero cells. MAb 4-5 was found to effectively neutralize all of the clinical isolates of SFTSV tested, which were isolated from patients in China from 2010 to 2012. MAb 4-5 was found to bind a linear epitope in the ectodomain of glycoprotein Gn. Its neutralizing activity is attributed to blockage of the interactions between the Gn protein and the cellular receptor, indicating that inhibition of virus-cell attachment is its main mechanism. These data suggest that MAb 4-5 can be used as a promising candidate molecule for immunotherapy against SFTSV infection.","output":"Human antibody neutralizes severe Fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, an emerging hemorrhagic Fever virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the SARS CoV-2, referred to as COVID-19, was initially reported in 2019 and has swiftly spread around the world. The identification of COVID-19 cases is one of the key factors to inhibit the spread of the virus. While there are multiple ways to diagnose COVID-19, these techniques are often expensive, time-consuming, or not readily available. Detection of COVID-19 using a radiological examination of Chest X-Rays provides a more viable, rapid, and efficient solution as it is easily available in most countries. The paper outlines a method that employs an unsupervised convolutional filter learning using Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) followed by applying it to COVID-19 classification as a downstream task. This shows that the proposed technique provides state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 99.7%, AUC of 99.7%, specificity of 99.8%, sensitivity of 99.6%, and F1-score of 99.6%.

Influence of the habitat complexity on the prey-predator interactions is well established through several studies. In the present instance, the IGP involving the heteropteran predators and the dipteran prey were assessed in the background of the habitat complexity. The three predators Diplonychus rusticus, Ranatra filiformis, and Laccotrephes griseus, one intraguild prey Anisops bouvieri and two dipteran prey Culex quinquefasciatus and Chironomus sp. were used in different relative density against the complex habitat conditions to deduce the impact on the mortality on the prey. In comparison to the open conditions, the presence of the macrophytes and pebbles reduced the mortality of the shared prey under intraguild system as well as single predator system. The mortality of the shared prey was however dependent on the density of the predator and prey. Considering the shared prey mortality, predation on mosquito larvae was always higher in single predator system than chironomid larvae irrespective of identity and density of predators. However, for both the shared prey, complexity of habitat reduced the prey vulnerability in comparison to the simple habitat condition. Higher observed prey consumption depicts the higher risk to predation of shared prey, though the values varied with habitat conditions. Mortality of IG prey (A. bouvieri) in IGP system followed the opposite trend of the shared prey. The lower mortality in simple habitat and higher mortality in complex habitat conditions was observed for the IG prey, irrespective of shared prey and predator density. In IGP system, the shared prey mortality was influenced by the habitat conditions, with more complex habitat reducing the vulnerability of the shared prey and increased mortality of the IG prey. This implies that the regulation of the mosquitoes, in the IGP system will be impeded by the habitat conditions, with the heteropteran predators as the top predator.","output":"Influence of habitat complexity on the prey mortality in IGP system involving insect predators (Heteroptera) and prey (Diptera): Implications in biological control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction After more than a year of pharmacology delivery through a virtual curriculum to help prepare medical students to successfully complete the USMLE Step-1 and/or COMLEX Level-1 (for osteopathic medical students), these high stakes board exams will transition to a Pass/Fail system in 2022 To reflect on the effectiveness of the pharmacology educational approaches used before and after the rapid implementation of emergency remote teaching, board results outcomes, faculty student evaluations and student feedback were reviewed and compared to results from national satisfaction instruments during the past decade Our hypothesis is that satisfaction with the pre-clerkship pharmacology instruction will increase during the clerkship years as measured by the satisfaction instruments after graduation Methods The aggregate data published between 2010-2020 by national satisfaction instruments including: 1) Academic Year Graduating Seniors Survey Report published by the AACOM and 2) All-Schools Summary Report Medical School Graduation Questionnaire published by the AAMC, was used to develop a construct of satisfaction scores in pharmacology Pharmacology faculty student evaluations from the Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine were analyzed using a thematic analysis method for student satisfaction Class performance outcomes on boards were also analyzed Results The population of medical students graduating has increased over the past decade, and national satisfaction instruments show that satisfaction of pharmacology instruction amongst the medical graduates also increased with the highest satisfaction score achieved in 2019 (2 13) and 2020 (2 14) compared to the lowest achieved in 2012 (1 97) Similarly, more osteopathic medical graduates agreed that instruction of clinical pharmacology was appropriate in 2019 (85%) compared to the lowest in 2011 (75%) (data from 2020 not yet available) Conclusions Pre-clerkship student satisfaction can be difficult to assess during a very stressful period, especially before the boards Pharmacology teaching is more intense, and in our institution, it has yielded positive outcomes in board passing rates In March of 2020, pharmacology faculty were faced with the challenge of rapidly transitioning into emergency remote teaching due to the Covid-19 pandemic This pandemic will likely continue to disrupt medical education well into the end of 2021, just before the USMLE Step-1/COMLEX Level-1 boards implement the pass/fail grading system With all these changes and disruptions, pharmacology education is at a crossroads and it hinges on the future direction","output":"Medical Pharmacology Education at a Crossroads: Looking in a Future Direction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long-term effects of Covid-19 disease are still poorly understood.

In general, there is a lack of academic literature that addresses private aviation operations and its impact on emissions. The purpose of this study is to fill that gap by analyzing the environmental implications of the COVID-19 induced shift toward private aviation in the U.S. We find that the number of private aviation flights in the U.S. increased by 20% after the beginning of the pandemic, which resulted in an increase of CO(2)-equivalent emissions by 23%.

Thanks to the wide diffusion of devices connecting to the World Wide Web, a large part of the population are now able to access to telemedicine services. The aim of this survey was to explore the willingness and hesitancy of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to the use of telemedicine during COVD-19 outbreak. Methods: A paper-and-pencil questionnaire was proposed to all consecutive patients observed at our tertiary IBD center in San Giovanni Rotondo (Italy) from February to May 2021. The survey investigated 20 items that can be grouped into 5 areas: socio-demographic data, clinical data, informatics competence, devices and network utilized for the internet connection, attitude to the telemedicine, and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 156 patients completed the questionnaire (100 males). One hundred forthy-three patients (91.7%) were under 65 years and only 15 (9.6%) were graduates. Forthy-seven patients (30%) were single, 101 married (65%). Eighteen patients (11.5%) felt they had no IT skills. Eight patients (5.1%) had a previous experience of telemedicine. One hundred twenty-three patients (78.8%) consider the support of telemedicine useful for the management of their pathology and 134 (85.9%) would like the Center where they are followed up to have the possibility of offering a telemedicine service. One hundred three patients (66.0%) would like to have a teleconsultation with figures other than the Gastroenterologist. Ninety-seven patients (62.2%) agree that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has a major impact on the need to implement telemedicine.

In direct Annexin V staining assays, the 3a protein-expressing cells showed increased apoptosis that was attenuated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. A block in nuclear translocation of the STAT3 transcription factor in cells expressing the 3a protein was also observed.

The aim of this scoping review is to summarize the evidence on: (1) the outcomes of OHL-interventions at patient, professional and organizational levels; and (2) the factors and strategies that affect implementation and outcomes of OHL-interventions. We reviewed empirical studies following the five-stage framework of Arksey and OMalley. The databases Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo and CINAHL were searched from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019, focusing on OHL-interventions using terms related to health literacy, health care organization and intervention characteristics. After a full-text review, we selected 24 descriptive stu-dies. Of these, 23 studies reported health literacy problems in relation to OHL-assessment tools. Nine out of thirteen studies reported that the use of interventions resulted in positive changes on OHL-domains regarding comprehensible communication, professionals competencies and practices, and strategic organizational changes. Organization-wide OHL-interventions resulted in some improvement of patient outcomes but evidence was scarce. Critical factors for organization-wide implementation of OHL-interventions were leadership support, top-down and bottom-up approaches, a change champion, and staff commitment.

The extant literature mainly focuses on a singular stressor among various aspects of their work or life. In addition, the extant literature generally uses questionnaires or interviews to obtain data. Data obtained in such ways are often subjective and lack authenticity. We propose a novel machineChuman hybrid approach to conduct qualitative content analysis of user-generated online content to explore the stressors of young employees in contemporary society. The user-generated online contents were collected from a famous Q&A platform in China and we adopted natural language processing and deep learning technology to discover knowledge. Our results identified three kinds of new stressors, that is, affection from leaders, affection from the social circle, and the gap between dream and reality. These new identified stressors were due to the lack of social security and regulation, frequent occurrences of social media fearmongering, and subjective cognitive bias, respectively. In light of our findings, we offer valuable practical insights and policy recommendations to relieve stress and improve mental health of young employees. The primary contributions of our work are two-fold, as follows. First, we propose a novel approach to explore the stressors of young employees in contemporary society, which is applicable not only in China, but also in other countries and regions.

While the wild type produced large plaques consisting of fused cells (fusion type) both at 39 and at 32, the mutant produced small fusion-type plaques at 39, and at 32, only after longer incubation, plaques consisting of round dead cells (non-fusion type) were obtained. The mutant grew equally well at both temperatures. Thus, the mutant was cold sensitive in inducing cell fusion, but not in replication or in ultimate cell killing. The cold sensitivity was overcome by the addition of trypsin (0.04 to 0.05%) to the culture medium, but not by treating the virions with trypsin. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the virion proteins failed to detect differences between the wild type and the mutant. In intracellular viral proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-MHV-S rabbit serum, a protein of 68,000 daltons (68K protein) which was present in the wild type-infected cells was absent in the mutant-infected cells, but trypsin treatment or incubation at 39 of the mutant-infected cells failed to induce the 68K protein. After six to seven undiluted passages, the mutant segregated varieties of mutants which were partially or totally reverted to the wild type in phenotype, and also those whose cell fusion induction was absent even at 39. All these mutants failed to induce the 68K protein in the infected cells. Thus, there was no linkage between the presence of 68K protein and the fusion induction. Trypsin treatment of the infected cells enabled MHV-S to form fusion plaques on otherwise resistant cells, and MHV-2, a producer of non-fusion-type plaques, to form fusion-type plaques.

To reduce the spread, it is important to engage in preventive behaviors recommended by health authorities, such as washing your hands, wearing a face mask, and social distancing. Aim: In the present study, we draw from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to examine the associations between perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norm and whether people engage in eight different preventive behaviors. Methods: For each of the preventive behaviors (washing hands; using hand sanitizer; not touching your face; social distancing; wearing a face mask; disinfecting surfaces; coughing in your elbow; staying home if sick), we conducted separate logistic regressions predicting whether the participants (N = 2,256; age range = 1898 years) reported engaging in the behavior from their perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norm. Results: We found that perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norm had independent significant associations with each preventive behavior. Moderation analyses revealed that for most behaviors the associations with perceived behavioral control were stronger for older adults than for younger adults. Limitation: The present study was cross-sectional; future longitudinal studies and interventions are needed to disentangle directionality.

This study aimed to replicate these findings using a European sample (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, SHARE). DESIGN: We analyzed data of 51,630 respondents aged 50 years and older (M: 63.5 years, standard deviation [SD]: 9.1) with at least two cognitive assessments (follow-up M: 6.06 years, SD: 3.86). Cognitive scores were transformed to Z-scores. Multiple growth curve modeling was used to model cognitive status and decline as predicted by the SoDep Index. In a sensitivity analysis, we constructed a new SoDep Index (SoDep Indexnew) including further social deprivation domains. RESULTS: Adjusting for covariates, a unit increase in SoDep Index was associated with a cognitive score of 0.037 SDs smaller (p < .001) and a decline 0.003 SDs per year faster (p < .001). Of the covariates, depressive symptoms, chronic disease burden, male gender, and widowhood were also associated with poorer cognition. Being divorced was associated with better cognition. Sensitivity analysis confirmed findings. Compared to the SoDep Index, the SoDep Indexnew showed a more pronounced association with both cognition and cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to replicate results showing an association between SoDep Index and cognitive function and decline. The sensitivity analysis further emphasizes the relevance of financial security. This strengthens the implication that preventing social deprivation can contribute to reducing the dementia burden by raising cognitive functioning in the older population.

In order to facilitate a full range of services for patients, some states permit advanced practice nurses to practice with full independence. However, many states limit their scopes of practice, resulting in the potential for limited healthcare access in underserved areas. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily upended these arrangements for several states, as 17 governors quickly passed waivers and suspensions of physician oversight restrictions. ISSUES: Physician resistance is a primary hurdle for states that limit advanced practice nurse scopes of practice. Longstanding restrictions were removed, however, in a short period of time. The pandemic demonstrated that even governors with strong political disagreements agreed on one way that healthcare access could potentially be improved. LESSONS LEARNED: Despite longstanding concerns over patient safety when advanced practice nurses practice with full autonomy, governors quickly removed practice restrictions when faced with a crisis situation. Implied in such behavior are that policymakers were aware of advanced practice nurses' capabilities prior to the pandemic, but chose not to implement full practice authority, and that governors appeared to disagree as to whether to temporarily waive specific restrictions or suspend restrictions entirely, consistent with their political affiliation. We propose more research into understanding whether or not such changes should become permanent.","output":"Seventeen states enacted executive orders expanding advanced practice nurses' scopes of practice during the first 21 days of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lipofuscin is an intracellular aging pigment with fluorescent properties, found in retinal pigment epithelium cells of the eye.

They occupy their hosts for a few days (influenza), for a few weeks (measles), or even lifelong (HCV), which manifests in acute or chronic infections. The various transmission routes (airborne, via direct physical contact, etc.), degrees of infectiousness (referring to the viral load required for transmission), antigenic variation/immune escape and virulence define further aspects of pathogenic lifestyles. To survive, pathogens must infect new hosts; the success determines their fitness. Infection happens with a certain likelihood during contact of hosts, where contact can also be mediated by vectors. Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network, three parameters appear to be key: the contact rate and the infectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third the immunity of susceptible hosts. On these grounds, what can be said about the reproductive success of viral pathogens? This is the biological question addressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results of the author and makes explicit connection to another basic work on the evolution of pathogens. A mathematical framework is presented that models intra- and inter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad spectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections, childhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn out as local maxima of numerically simulated fitness landscapes. The models involve differential and integral equations, agent-based simulation, networks, and probability.","output":"A Mathematical Framework for Predicting Lifestyles of Viral Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Twenty specific pathogen free cats were experimentally infected with a virulent cat-passaged type I field strain of FIPV.

The absolute lymphocyte count of the surviving cat remained within normal range. Serum antibodies as measured by indirect immunofluorescence appeared after 2 weeks p.i. and correlated with the onset of disease signs. Viral genomic RNA was either not detectable by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) or detectable only at very low levels in terminal tissues not involved directly in the infection, including hepatic and renal parenchyma, cardiac muscle, lung or popliteal lymph node.

These changes are clearly seen in mobility data, which records foot traffic using location trackers in cell phones. While mobility data is often used to extract the number of customers that visit a particular business or business type, it is the frequency and duration of concurrent occupancy at those sites that governs transmission. Understanding the way people interact at different locations can help target policies and inform contact tracing and prevention strategies. This paper outlines methods to extract interactions from mobility data and build networks that can be used in epidemiological models. Several measures of interaction are extracted: interactions between people, the cumulative interactions for a single person, and cumulative interactions that occur at particular businesses. Network metrics are computed to identify structural trends which show clear changes based on the timing of stay-at-home orders. Measures of interaction and structural trends in the resulting networks can be used to better understand potential spreading events, the percent of interactions that can be classified as close contacts, and the impact of policy choices to control transmission.","output":"Analysis of mobility data to build contact networks for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a fast-growing pathology around the world, being considered the most common chronic liver disease. It is diagnosed based on the presence of steatosis in more than 5% of hepatocytes without significant alcohol consumption. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current studies of artificial intelligence (AI) applications that may help physicians in implementing a complete automated NAFLD diagnosis and staging. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and WILEY databases were screened for relevant publications in relation to AI applications in NAFLD. The search terms included: (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease OR NAFLD) AND (artificial intelligence OR machine learning OR neural networks OR deep learning OR automated diagnosis OR computer-aided diagnosis OR digital pathology OR automated ultrasound OR automated computer tomography OR automated magnetic imaging OR electronic health records). Results: Our search identified 37 articles about automated NAFLD diagnosis, out of which 15 articles analyzed imagistic techniques, 15 articles analyzed digital pathology, and 7 articles analyzed electronic health records (EHC). All studies included in this review show an accurate capacity of automated diagnosis and staging in NAFLD using AI-based software. Conclusions: We found significant evidence demonstrating that implementing a complete automated system for NAFLD diagnosis, staging, and risk stratification is currently possible, considering the accuracy, sensibility, and specificity of available AI-based tools.","output":"Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Implementing Complete Automated Diagnosis and Staging.

METHODS: Using a mathematical model we investigate the impact of interruption to MDA in trachoma-endemic settings. We evaluate potential measures to mitigate this impact and consider alternative strategies for accelerating progress in those areas where the trachoma elimination targets may not be achievable otherwise. RESULTS: We demonstrate that for districts that were hyperendemic at baseline, or where the trachoma elimination thresholds have not already been achieved after three rounds of MDA, the interruption to planned MDA could lead to a delay to reaching elimination targets greater than the duration of interruption. We also show that an additional round of MDA in the year following MDA resumption could effectively mitigate this delay. For districts where the probability of elimination under annual MDA was already very low, we demonstrate that more intensive MDA schedules are needed to achieve agreed targets. CONCLUSION: Through appropriate use of additional MDA, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of delay to reaching trachoma elimination targets can be effectively mitigated. Additionally, more frequent MDA may accelerate progress towards 2030 goals.","output":"Modelling trachoma post-2020: opportunities for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and accelerating progress towards elimination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We revisit the construct of political polarization and current distinctions between issue-driven and affective polarization. Based on our review of recent research on polarization from psychology, political science, and communication, we propose to treat polarization as a process that integrates the concepts of social identification (collective self-definition) with ideologically opposed camps - that is, psychological groups based on support or opposition to specific socio-political issues and policies (related to issue-driven polarization), and that of ideological and psychological distancing between groups (related to affective polarization). Furthermore, we discuss the foundations of polarizing groups C and more specifically, the role of conflicting collective narratives about social reality in providing an initial platform for polarization in a technologically networked world. In particular, we highlight the importance of online media in facilitating and enhancing polarization between ideologically opposed camps. As a theoretical contribution, the review provides a more functional conceptualization of polarization that can explain how polarization may occur across partisan fault lines and in domains outside of politics. We conclude with a discussion of new pathways to the study of polarization which this integrative conceptualization opens.","output":"Online Intergroup Polarization Across Political Fault Lines: An Integrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structure and function of cells are critically dependent on membranes, which not only separate the interior of the cell from its environment but also define the internal compartments. It is therefore not surprising that the major steps of the life cycle of viruses of animals and plants also depend on cellular membranes. Indeed, interactions of viral proteins with host cell membranes are important for viruses to enter into host cells, replicate their genome, and produce progeny particles. To replicate its genome, a virus first needs to cross the plasma membrane. Some viruses can also modify intracellular membranes of host cells to create a compartment in which genome replication will take place. Finally, some viruses acquire an envelope, which is derived either from the plasma membrane or an internal membrane of the host cell. This paper reviews recent findings on the interactions of viral proteins with host cell membranes during the viral life cycle.","output":"Interactions Between Virus Proteins and Host Cell Membranes During the Viral Life Cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and persist today. For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate adverse effect on the productivity of female researchers in the biomedical field in terms of authorship of scientific publications. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results. RESULTS: A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean yest=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, Sest=0.007; standard error of the observation, &#963;x=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (yest=0.39; y=0.28; Sest=0.007; &#963;x=0.007). When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (yest=0.25; y=0.23; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (yest=0.25; y=0.21; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.007). Further, by geocoding authors' affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global pandemic. This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in the gender gap was persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of researchers. These results should be used to inform the scientific community of this worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the disproportionate effect that the pandemic has had on female academics.","output":"Gender Disparity in the Authorship of Biomedical Research Publications During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to compare diaphragmatic motion on dual-source high-pitch (DS-HP) and conventional single-source (SS) CT scans in trauma patients. Seventy-five consecutive trauma patients who presented to a level one trauma center over a 6-month period were scanned with a standardized whole body trauma CT protocol including both DS-HP chest (pitch = 2.1-2.5) and SS abdominal CT scans. Subjective analysis of diaphragmatic motion was performed by two readers using a four-point motion scale in seven regions of the diaphragm on coronal and axial slices. An overall confidence score to exclude a diaphragmatic tear was determined (1 to 10, 10: completely confident and 1: impossible to exclude). Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Mean confidence score of 9.85 for DS-HP was significantly better than the mean score of 7.66 for SS images (p < 0.0001). Diaphragmatic motion scores and subjective diaphragmatic motion artifact on coronal and axial images were significantly better for DS-HP images in all areas when compared individually (p < 0.0001) and overall (p < 0.0001). Regions of DS-HP (99.2 %) were diagnostic, whereas only 87.0 % % regions on SS were. Complete agreement of motion scores was present in 92 % of cases, with moderate overall agreement for confidence to exclude a diaphragmatic tear ( = 0.45).

This metaphor highlights that stigma is not a static or fixed state but is enacted through processes of continuity and change. The following three orienting concepts are identified: (a) lineage (i.e. origin narratives and initial manifestations are created in relation to existing stigmas, stereotypes, and outgroups), (b) variation (i.e. stigma changes over time in response to new content and contexts), and (c) strength (i.e. stigma can be amplified or weakened through counter- or de-stigmatizing forces). I go on to use this metaphor to offer an analysis of the emergence of COVID-19 stigma. The lineage of COVID-19 stigma includes a long history of contagious disease, resonant with fears of contamination and death. Origin narratives have stigmatized Asian/Chinese groups as virus carriers, leading to socio-political manifestations of discrimination. Newer 'risky' groups have emerged in relation to old age, race and ethnicity, poverty, and weight, whose designation as 'vulnerable' simultaneously identifies them as victims in need of protection but also as a risk to the social body. Counter-stigmatizing trends are also visible. Public disclosure of having COVID-19 by high-status individuals such as the actor Tom Hanks has, in some instances, converted 'testing positive' into shared rather than shamed behaviour in the West. As discourses concerning risk, controllability, and blame unfold, so COVID-19 stigma will further mutate. In conclusion, the metaphor of mutation, and its three concepts of lineage, variation, and strength, offers a vocabulary through which to articulate emergent and ongoing stigma processes. Furthermore, the concept of stigma mutation identifies a clear role for social scientists and public health in terms of process engagement;to disrupt stigma, remaking it in less deadly forms or even to prevent its emergence altogether.","output":"Stigma Mutation: Tracking Lineage, Variation and Strength in Emerging COVID-19 Stigma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a pandemic of COVID-19. The absence of a therapeutic drug and vaccine is causing severe loss of life and economy worldwide. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming for viral entry into host cells. A potential way to reduce the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2. In the current study, the three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was generated by homology modelling and subsequently validated with a number of parameters. The structure-based virtual screening of Selleckchem database was performed through 'Virtual Work Flow' (VSW) to find out potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat and bromhexine are known TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence these were used as control molecules throughout the study. Based on better dock score, binding-free energy and binding interactions compared to the control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, and Ambroxol) were found to be promising against the TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed a number of significant binding interactions with binding site amino residues of TMPRSS2. The all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated that all proposed molecules retain inside the receptor in dynamic states. The binding energy calculated from the MD simulation trajectories also favour the strong affinity of the molecules towards the TMPRSS2. Proposed molecules belong to the bioflavonoid class of phytochemicals and are reported to possess antiviral activity, our study indicates their possible potential for application in COVID-19.

Hospital readmission rate and ED-visits within 30 days from discharge are considered low-cost quality indicators. This work assesses an indicator of quality of care in a tertiary referral hospital in Argentina, using data available from clinical records. PURPOSE: To estimate the rate of ED-visits and the hospital readmission rate (HRR) after a first hospitalization (First-H), and to identify associated factors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included patients who had a First-H in Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires between 2014-2015. Follow-up occurred from discharge until ED-visit, readmission, death, disaffiliation from health insurance, or 13 months. We present HRR at 30 days and ED-visits rate at 72 hours, using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model to explore associated factors, and reporting adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with their respective 95%CI. RESULTS: The study comprised 10,598 hospitalizations (median age was 68 years). Of these, 5,966 had at least one consultation to the ED during follow up, resulting in a 24 hour rate of consultations to ED of 1.51% (95%CI 1.29-1.72); at 48 hours 3.18% (95%CI 2.86-3.54); at 72 hours 4.71% (95%CI 4.32-5.13). In multivariable models, factors associated for 72 hours ED-visits were: age (aHR 1.06), male (aHR 1.14), Charlson Comorbidity Index (aHR 1.16), unscheduled hospitalization (aHR 1.39), prior consultation with the ED (aHR 1.08) and long hospital stay (aHR 1.39). Meanwhile, 2,345 patients had at least one hospital readmission (98% unscheduled), resulting a 24 hour rate of 0.5% (95%CI 0.42-0.71), at 48 hours 0.98% (95%CI 0.80-1.18), at 72 hours 1.4% (95%CI 1.2-1.6); at 30 days 7.7% (95%CI 7.2-8.2); at 90 days 13% (95%CI 12.4-13.8); and one-year 22.5% (95%CI 21.7-23.4). Associated factors for HRR at 30 days were: age (HR 1.16), male (HR 1.09), Charlson comorbidities score (HR 1.27), social service requirement during First-H (HR 1.37), unscheduled First-H (HR 1.16), previous ED-visits (HR 1.03) and length of stay (HR 1.08).

We successfully synthesized biliatresone with a purity of 98% and confirmed its biliary toxicity. Exposure to high doses of biliatresone caused abortion or death in pregnant mice. Neonatal mice injected with biliatresone developed clinical signs of biliary obstruction, and dysplasia or the absence of extrahepatic biliary tract lumen, which confirmed the occurrence of biliary atresia. In the portal tract of biliary atresia mice, signs of infiltration of inflammatory cells and liver fibrosis were observed. The signature of extrahepatic biliary gene expression in these mice mainly involved the cell adhesion process, and hepatic RNA-seq was highly linked to transcriptional evidence of oxidative stress. When compared with the control group, hepatic glutathione levels were markedly reduced after biliatresone injection. Taken together, these data confirm that biliatresone causes severe developmental abnormalities of the hepatobiliary system in mice.

METHODOLOGY: Data were collected from a single COVID-19 quarantine hospital in Cairo. A total number of 195 cases were included with their clinical, laboratory, and radiological data. RESULTS: Three different age groups behaved differently for COVD-19 infection. The pediatric age group was asymptomatic entirely, the middle age group (18-50 years) were asymptomatic in 53.3% of cases, while 77.9% of those above 50 years were symptomatic (p &#8804; 0.001).

Several apical plasma membrane proteins have been found in secretory granules in cells from pancreas and salivary glands raising the possibility that incorporation into secretory granules followed by exocytosis of the granules accounts for their insertion into the apical plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we have expressed the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) in pancreatic AR42J cells, which make zymogen-like granules upon incubation with dexamethasone. The influenza virus HA is known to be specifically targeted to the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells that lack a regulated pathway and is also known to be excluded from secretory granules in virally-infected pituitary AtT20 cells. Localization of the protein by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that it accumulated at the plasma membrane of the transfected AR42J cells.

Emergence, prevalence, and lethality of zoonotic diseases is intrinsically linked to environmental management which are currently at a destructive level globally. The effects of these links are complicated and interdependent, creating an urgent need of elucidating the role of environmental mismanagement to improve our resilience to future pandemics. This review focused on the pertinent role of forests, outdoor air, indoor air, solid waste and wastewater management in COVID-19 dissemination to analyze the opportunities prevailing to control infectious diseases considering relevant data from previous disease outbreaks. Global forest management is currently detrimental and hotspots of forest fragmentation have demonstrated to result in zoonotic disease emergences. Deforestation is reported to increase susceptibility to COVID-19 due to wildfire induced pollution and loss of forest ecosystem services. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 like viruses in multiple animal species also point to the impacts of biodiversity loss and forest fragmentation in relation to COVID-19. Available literature on air quality and COVID-19 have provided insights into the potential of air pollutants acting as plausible virus carrier and aggravating immune responses and expression of ACE2 receptors. SARS-CoV-2 is detected in outdoor air, indoor air, solid waste, wastewater and shown to prevail on solid surfaces and aerosols for prolonged hours. Furthermore, lack of protection measures and safe disposal options in waste management are evoking concerns especially in underdeveloped countries due to high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Inadequate legal framework and non-adherence to environmental regulations were observed to aggravate the postulated risks and vulnerability to future waves of pandemics. Our understanding underlines the urgent need to reinforce the fragile status of global environmental management systems through the development of strict legislative frameworks and enforcement by providing institutional, financial and technical supports.","output":"Elucidating the role of environmental management of forests, air quality, solid waste and wastewater on the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The current study aimed to explore the effects of organized befriending for an Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) population.

Since it may take years to design a drug for its treatment, the shortest and most effective way now is to screen the available drugs or active substances by molecular docking methods. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the potential for use in COVID-19 treatment by investigating the inhibitory effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra, main active ingredients on COVID-19, main protease (SARS-CoV-2,), SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 Complex and ACE-2 by molecular docking method, which are known to have antiviral effects on SARS-CoV. Material and Methods: Molecular docking was performed by using Autodock 4.2 to analyse the proba-bility of docking. Several compounds extracted from the root of the licorice plant (glycyrrhizic acid, glabridin, 6-azauridine, pyrazofurin and mycophenolic acid) were docked to inhibit COVID-19 Mpro and docking results were analysed by Autodock 4.2 and Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer 2020. The evalu-ation was based on the docking score (binding energies) calculated by Autodock 4.2. Nelfinavir was used as standards for comparison. Results: As a result of the study, the compounds of Glabridin in COVID-19 main protease (6LU7), ACE-2 (1R4L) and SARS-CoV-2,-ACE2 Complex (6LZG) have very low binding energy (-8.75 to-7.64) and low potential to inhibition constant has been found. Conclusion: These results suggest that Glabridin appeared to have the best potential to act as a COVID-19 Mpro inhibitor.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented new barriers to care in the treatment of patients with HCV that resulted in a transition to tele-health services at many health systems to overcome these barriers. OBJECTIVE: To assess the real-world impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent shift to a telehealth model on collection of SVR data and other HCV treatment outcomes in a health-system setting. METHODS: Subjects who received a referral for an HCV direct-acting antiviral agent between January 1, 2018, and November 30, 2020, and were aged 18 years or older at time of enrollment were placed in either \\"pre-COVID-19\\" or \\"COVID-19\\" cohorts based on enrollment date. The primary endpoint of this study evaluated confirmed SVR to treatment determined by the absence of HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction testing at least 12 weeks after completion of drug therapy. Secondary endpoints evaluated completion of medication therapy and adherence to laboratory appointments. RESULTS: 1,504 patients met study inclusion criteria (pre-COVID-19 cohort, n = 1,230; COVID-19 cohort, n = 274). The COVID-19 cohort demonstrated significantly lower therapy completion rates (P = 0.001), were less likely to obtain SVR laboratory tests (P < 0.001), and had a significantly lower confirmed SVR rate (P < 0.001) compared with the pre-COVID-19 cohort. In a subset of patients who completed therapy and had SVR laboratory tests collected, there were no significant differences observed in the rate of patients who achieved SVR (P = 0.959). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with HCV were significantly less likely to complete therapy or participate in SVR laboratory work. Further studies are needed to determine if offering a telehealth option for our patients in a post-COVID-19 environment would offer any additional advantage in increasing access to care for patients with HCV.

This proffers the question whether NHP-derived adenoviruses could also be employed for viral oncolysis in human patients.

For binary comparisons we calculated incidence rate ratios and performed random-effect meta-analysis. Results: We observed a wide variation of background rates that goes well beyond age and database effects previously observed. While rates vary up to a factor of 1,000 across age groups, even after adjusting for age and sex, the study showed residual bias due to the other parameters. Rates were highly influenced by the choice of anchoring (e.g., health visit, vaccination, or arbitrary date) for the time-at-risk start. Anchoring on a healthcare encounter yielded higher incidence comparing to a random date, especially for short time-at-risk. Incidence rates were highly influenced by the choice of the database (varying by up to a factor of 100), clean window choice and time-at-risk duration, and less so by secular or seasonal trends.

The 1918 pandemic provides an opportunity to elucidate spatial determinants of spread on a large scale. To better characterize the spread of the 1918 major wave, we fitted a range of city-to-city transmission models to mortality data collected for 246 population centres in England and Wales and 47 cities in the US. Using a gravity model for city-to-city contacts, we explored the effect of population size and distance on the spread of disease and tested assumptions regarding density dependence in connectivity between cities. We employed Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate parameters of the model for population, infectivity, distance and density dependence. We inferred the most likely transmission trees for both countries. For England and Wales, a model that estimated the degree of density dependence in connectivity between cities was preferable by deviance information criterion comparison.

The aim of this study was to assess whether febrile human rhinovirus (HRV) illness is associated with adverse birth outcomes. METHODS: Active household-based weekly surveillance was performed for respiratory illness episodes in pregnant women as part of a community-based, prospective, randomized trial of maternal influenza immunization in rural Nepal. Rhinovirus (HRV) febrile illness episodes were defined as fever plus cough, sore throat, runny nose, and/or myalgia with HRV detected on mid-nasal swab. Multivariate regression analysis evaluated the association between febrile HRV respiratory illness and adverse birth outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 96 (3%) of 3693 pregnant women had HRV-positive febrile respiratory illnesses. Infants born to pregnant women with HRV febrile illness had a 1.6-fold increased risk of being LBW compared with those with non-HRV febrile illness (28 of 96 [38%] vs 109 of 458 [24%]; relative risk [RR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1C2.3).

Topical application of IMQ to back skin caused significant changes in the composition of microbiota in the intestine and skin of IMQ-treated mice compared to control mice. The LEfSe algorithm identified the species Staphylococcus lentus as potential skin microbial marker for IMQ group. Furthermore, there were correlations for several microbes between the intestine and skin, suggesting a role of skinCgutCmicrobiota in IMQ-treated mice. Levels of succinic acid and lactic acid in feces from IMQ-treated mice were significantly higher than control mice. Moreover, the predictive functional analysis of the microbiota in the intestine and skin showed that IMQ caused alterations in several KEGG pathways.

METHODS: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 106,279 eyes operated between March 23, 2019 and March 31, 2021. The data of patients who underwent cataract surgery presenting during the lockdown and unlock phases were compared with the respective periods in the previous year before COVID-19. RESULTS: The cataract surgeries performed decreased to 5.6% (839/14,994) of pre-COVID-19 volumes during the lockdown phase. There was a gradual recovery of the cataract surgeries performed to 86.7% of pre-COVID-19 volumes by May 2020 and exceeded by 17.9% by September 2020. There was a decrease in the number of women who underwent cataract surgery during the lockdown phase (49.11%) compared to the pre-COVID-19 (52.59%) or unlock phase (52.29%, P < 0.001). Patients operated during the lockdown phase were younger when compared to other groups (P < 0.001). The mean LogMAR presenting visual acuity at the time of surgery was worse in patients operated during the lockdown phase (1.84  1.16) as compared to pre-COVID-19 (1.39  1.05) and unlock phases (1.51  1.08, P =<0.001). The proportion of patients with total cataracts were higher during the lockdown and unlock phases compared to the pre-COVID-19 phase (P < 0.001).

It has a minimum and maximum power setting controlled by a single trigger for both coagulation and cutting. A laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed on a 56-year-old man with a 7-cm right renal mass. A laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in a 51-year-old man with high-risk prostate cancer. Data on surgical team satisfaction, operative time, number of activations, and times the laparoscope was removed as a result of plume were collected. RESULTS The surgical technician successfully assembled the device at the beginning of the cases with verbal instructions from the surgeon. Operative time for nephrectomy was 77 minutes, with 143 total activations (minimum = 86, maximum = 57). The operative time for the pelvic lymphadenectomy was 27 minutes, with 38 total activations (minimum = 27, maximum = 11). One battery was used in each case. The laparoscope was removed twice during the nephrectomy and once during the lymphadenectomy.

METHODS From April to September 2011, 50 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for simple appendicitis without gangrene or perforation. Patients who had undergone appendectomy with a drainage procedure were excluded. The type of surgery was chosen based on patient preference after written informed consent was obtained.

OBJECTIVES: The present research was conducted to determine the workplace challenges faced by nurses who had recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted using the interpretive phenomenological approach proposed by van Manen. The data collected through 17 in-depth semi-structured interviews with 14 eligible nurses at different occupational levels were analyzed using the six steps proposed by van Manen. These nurses had also recovered from COVID-19. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Urmia University of Medical Sciences (IR.UMSU.REC.1399.318). FINDINGS: Four themes and 20 subthemes extracted from analyzing the data explained the challenges faced by the nurses after their return to work. The themes included declined ethical values (four subthemes), infected nurses, forgotten patients (three subthemes), gradually leaving the job (six subthemes), and corona phobia (seven subthemes).

The ailment is currently spreading between individuals with no animal delegate. Researchers are struggling to follow the infection back to where it started to become familiar with its spread. In the event that, for example, specialists can locate the soonest cases, they might have the option to distinguish the creature have where the infection hides. In March and April 2020, researchers detailed that this virus created normally. Coronavirus has been become of the serious global phenomena in the recent years and has negative effects in the entire world health and economy. The virus is believed to have been associated with a host animal which human contracted. Subsequently, human-to-human infection began. Through migration as humans have become complex with easy mobility the disease has traveled to the entire continent. Now, numerous scientist are going on in the hope of obtaining medication and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease and mortality of the disease. It is important that we obtain quantitative and qualitative information about the etiology of this disease which is crucial. Mathematical modeling is capable of providing qualitative information on many parameters that guides the decision making of health practitioners. In this work we focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). To find the role of factors/parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R0; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. METHODS: To find the role of parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R0; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control mode. With the help of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian we minimize the density of contaminated stuff and infected human population. RESULTS: We focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs). On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control model. The major NPIs are, STAY HOME, SANITIZER (wash hands), EARLY CASE DETECTION (PCR Test) and FACE MASK. These NPIs helps in mitigation and reducing the size of outbreak of the disease. CONCLUSION: We check the existence of the optimal solution for the system. At the end, Using matlab we produce numerical simulations for validation of results of control variables.

However, little knowledge exists on the ability of porcine IL-22 (pIL-22) to fight against viral infection in the gut. In this study, we found that recombinant mature pIL-22 (mpIL-22) inhibited the infection of multiple diarrhea viruses, including alpha coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV), in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2) cells. mpIL-22 up-regulated the expression of the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin (BD-2), cytokine IL-18 and IFN-. Furthermore, we found that mpIL-22 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727 and Tyr705 in IPEC-J2 cells. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by S3I-201 abrogated the antiviral ability of mpIL-22 and the mpIL-22-induced expression of BD-2, IL-18, and IFN-. Together, mpIL-22 inhibited the infection of PoRV and enteric coronaviruses, and up-regulated the expression of antimicrobial genes in IPEC-J2, which were mediated by the activation of the STAT3 signal pathway. The significant antiviral activity of IL-22 to curtail multiple enteric diarrhea viruses in vitro suggests that pIL-22 could be a novel therapeutic against devastating viral diarrhea in piglets.","output":"IL-22 suppresses the infection of porcine enteric coronaviruses and rotavirus by activating STAT3 signal pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many patients report persistent symptoms attributable to dysfunction of the peripheral nervous and muscular systems after acute COVID-19.

Additionally, the utility (i.e. time to diagnosis and treatment) of this enhanced clinical pathway was evaluated. METHODS The study was conducted through the Victorian Infant Hearing Screening Programme (VIHSP) across four maternity hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, during June 2019-March 2020. Parents were approached by VIHSP staff about obtaining a test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) at the time of their baby's second positive ('refer') result on the VIHSP screen. Participating parents collected a saliva swab for CMV polymerase chain reaction from their infants. Feasibility was determined by the proportion of 'referred' infants whose parents completed the salivary CMV screening test 21 days of life. Acceptability was measured through parent survey. RESULTS Of 126 eligible families, 96 (76.0%) had salivary screening swabs taken 21 days of life. Most families (>92.0%) indicated that screening was acceptable, straightforward and thought testing their baby for cCMV was a good idea. One infant screened positive on day 30, was diagnosed with cCMV via confirmatory testing by day 31 and commenced valganciclovir on day 32.

Using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been suggested in various studies as an effective option. Our study aims to access the efficacy of IVIG in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective matched cohort study, records of three tertiary centers with a large number of COVID-19 admissions were evaluated and used. Based on treatment options, patients were divided into two groups, standard COVID-19 treatment (109 patients) and IVIG treatment (74 patients) patients. Also, the effect of IVIG in different dosages was evaluated. Patients with IVIG treatment were divided into three groups of low (0.25 gr/kg), medium (0.5 gr/kg), and high (1 gr/kg) dose. Data analysis was performed using an independent t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the outcomes between two groups, including duration of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and mortality rate. RESULTS: The duration of hospitalization in the IVIG group was significantly longer than standard treatment (13.74 days vs. 11.10 days, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in ICU length of stay, the number of intubated patients, and duration of mechanical ventilation (p > 0.05). Also, initial outcomes in IVIG subgroups were compared separately with the standard treatment group. The results indicated that only the duration of hospitalization in the IVIG subgroup with medium dose is significantly longer than the standard treatment group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the use of IVIG in critically ill COVID-19 patients could not be beneficial, based on no remarkable differences in duration of hospitalization, ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and even mortality rate.","output":"The outcome of using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in critically ill COVID-19 patients: a retrospective, multi-centric cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two patients with respiratory failure due to confirmed COVID-19 were examined using bedside lung ultrasound (LUS) shortly after intubation and start of invasive ventilation.

Oxygenation improved further with the use of prone positioning. In the second patient, LUS showed diffuse abnormalities without atelectatic areas, and ventilation proceeded without a recruitment maneuver but with prone positioning. These two cases illustrate how LUS could be useful in identifying different lung morphologies early after the start of invasive ventilation and help decide on adjunctive therapies.

Here, we isolated an infectious Omicron virus in Belgium, from a traveller returning from Egypt. We examined its sensitivity to 9 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) clinically approved or in development4, and to antibodies present in 115 sera from COVID-19 vaccine recipients or convalescent individuals. Omicron was totally or partially resistant to neutralization by all mAbs tested.

Although the main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are associated with respiratory or intestinal symptoms, reports of neurological signs and symptoms are increasing. The etiology of these neurological manifestations remains obscure, and probably involves several direct pathways, not excluding the direct entry of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory epithelium, circumventricular organs, or disrupted bloodCbrain barrier. Furthermore, neuroinflammation might occur in response to the strong systemic cytokine storm described for COVID-19, or due to dysregulation of the CNS rennin-angiotensin system. Descriptions of neurological manifestations in patients in the previous coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks have been numerous for the SARS-CoV and lesser for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Strong evidence from patients and experimental models suggests that some human variants of CoV have the ability to reach the CNS and that neurons, astrocytes, and/or microglia can be target cells for CoV. A growing body of evidence shows that astrocytes and microglia have a major role in neuroinflammation, responding to local CNS inflammation and/or to disbalanced peripheral inflammation. This is another potential mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 damage to the CNS. In this comprehensive review, we will summarize the known neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV; explore the potential role for astrocytes and microglia in the infection and neuroinflammation; and compare them with the previously described human and animal CoV that showed neurotropism to propose possible underlying mechanisms.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Impact on the Central Nervous System: Are Astrocytes and Microglia Main Players or Merely Bystanders?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, understanding the basic epidemiological parameter values of COVID-19 from real-world data in mega-cities is essential for disease prevention and control.

METHODS A total of 373216 junior and senior high school students were recruited using a cluster sampling method in Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Xinyang city of Henan Province, China, during February 4-12, 2020. Presence of anxiety symptoms was determined by Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7). Multiple logistic regression was performed to estimate the potential risk factors. RESULTS Among the participants, junior and senior high school students were found to have anxiety symptoms, producing an overall prevalence of 9.89%. The prevalence was lower in female than in male (9.66% vs. 10.11%) and the prevalence was higher for junior high school students than senior high school students (13.89% vs. 12.93%). The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was highest among rural students and lowest among urban students (11.33% vs. 8.77%). The cognitive level was negatively associated with the prevalence of anxiety symptoms. After adjusting for potential confounders, age, gender, residential location, worried level, fear level and behavior status were found to be associated with anxiety symptoms. LIMITATIONS Prevalence may be skewed by assessing anxiety symptoms using self-reported scales rather than clinical interviews. CONCLUSIONS This large-scale study assesses the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and its potential influencing factors in junior and senior high school students.

In many countries of the Global South, NPIs are affecting rural livelihoods, but in-depth empirical data on these impacts are limited. We traced the differentiated impacts of Covid NPIs throughout the start of the pandemic May to July 2020. We conducted qualitative weekly phone interviews (n=441) with 92 panelists from nine contrasting rural communities across Mozambique (3 to 7 study weeks), exploring how panelists livelihoods changed and how the NPIs intersected with, and often exacerbated, existing vulnerabilities, and created new exposures. The NPIs significantly re-shaped many livelihoods and placed greatest burdens on those with precarious incomes, women, children and the elderly, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and creating new exposures. Travel and trading restrictions and rising prices for consumables including food meant some respondents were concerned about dying not of Covid, but of hunger because of the disruptions caused by NPIs. No direct health impacts of the pandemic were reported during our study period. Most market-orientated income diversification strategies largely failed to provide resilience to the NPI shocks. The exception was one specific case linked to a socially-minded value chain for baobab, where a strong duty of care helped avoid the collapse of incomes seen elsewhere. In contrast, agricultural and charcoal value chains either collapsed or saw producer prices and volumes reduced. The hyper-covariate, unprecedented nature of the shock caused significant restrictions on livelihoods through trading and transport limits and thus a region-wide decline in cash generation opportunities, which was seen as being unlike any prior shock. The scale of human-made interventions and their repercussions thus raises questions about the roles of institutional actors, diversification and socially-minded trading partners in addressing coping and vulnerability both conceptually and in policy-making.","output":"To prevent this disease, we have to stay at home, but if we stay at home, we die of hunger C livelihoods, vulnerability and coping with Covid-19 in rural Mozambique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the 1930s, street vending in Los Angeles has been classified as a misdemeanor, punishable by jail time and fines.

Similar patterns have been observed within London, almost mimicking a microcosm of the country's survival patterns. This evidence has suggested that the area of residence plays an important role in the survival from cancer. METHODS: We analysed the survival from colon cancer of patients diagnosed in 2006-2013, in a pre-pandemic period, living in London at their diagnosis and received care in a London hospital. We examined the patterns of patient pathways between the area of residence and the hospital of care using flow maps, and we investigated whether geographical variations in survival from colon cancer are associated with the hospital of care. To estimate survival, we applied a Bayesian excess hazard model which accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data. RESULTS: Geographical disparities in colon cancer survival disappeared once controlled for hospitals, and the disparities seemed to be augmented between hospitals. However, close examination of patient pathways revealed that the poorer survival observed in some hospitals was mostly associated with higher proportions of emergency diagnosis, while their performance was generally as expected for patients diagnosed through non-emergency routes. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the need to better coordinate primary and secondary care sectors in some areas of London to improve timely access to specialised clinicians and diagnostic tests. This challenge remains crucially relevant after the recent successive regroupings of Clinical Commissioning Groups (which grouped struggling areas together) and the observed exacerbation of disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Variation in colon cancer survival for patients living and receiving care in London, 2006-2013: does where you live matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia and can occur de novo following a surgical procedure.

A systematic search of the Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases was conducted. Studies were included in the review if they reported cases of new-onset atrial fibrillation within 30 days of the index operation. Results were evaluated qualitatively due to substantial clinical heterogeneity. Incidence rates were pooled using a weighted random-effects meta-analysis model.

METHODS SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both measured in 26 specimens from 16 patients with SARS, 40 follow up specimens from the same batch of patients, and appropriate control subjects. The relation between SARS positivity and GAPDH mRNA concentration was investigated using the chi2 test. Increasing the sensitivity for SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA detection was investigated in follow up specimens in which SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were not detected initially. RESULTS Varying amounts of SARS-CoV were found in the 26 SARS-CoV positive specimens and SARS-CoV was not detected in the 40 follow up specimens and controls. In addition, concentrations of GAPDH mRNA were significantly different between the patients with SARS, follow up specimens, and healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.05). Moreover, GAPDH mRNA concentrations were highly correlated with SARS-CoV positivity (chi2 = 5.43; p<0.05). Finally, SARS-CoV and GAPDH mRNA were both detected in three follow up urine specimens that were initially negative when the amount of cDNA used was increased from 5 microl to 10 and 15 microl.

Our primary objective was to determine whether lung ultrasound (LUS) B-lines, when excluding patients with alternative etiologies for B-lines, are more sensitive for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19 than CXR. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented to a single, academic emergency department in the United States between March 20 and April 6, 2020, and received LUS, CXR, and viral testing for COVID-19 as part of their diagnostic evaluation. The primary objective was to estimate the test characteristics of both LUS B-lines and CXR for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the proportion of patients with COVID-19 that have secondary LUS findings of pleural abnormalities and subpleural consolidations. RESULTS: We identified 43 patients who underwent both LUS and CXR and were tested for COVID-19. Of these, 27/43 (63%) tested positive. LUS was more sensitive (88.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 71.1C97.0) for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19 than CXR (51.9%, 95% CI, 34.0C69.3; p = 0.013).

In addition, people with life-threatening conditions deferred care for their fear of contagion. The study aimed to evaluate the indirect impact of Covid-19 on hospitalization rates for cardiovascular diseases in 2020 in Abruzzo. METHODS: Data were obtained from the hospital discharge records of all Abruzzo. We analyzed all the hospitalizations included in Major Diagnostic Categories 5 (cardiovascular diseases). First, we distinguished both between public or private hospitalizations and ordinary or day-hospital admissions. Second, we compared the first nine months of 2020 with a mean of the same months in the two previous years. Finally, we calculated the variable percentage. RESULTS: A huge reduction in hospitalization in MCD 5 contest was observed in each subgroup. Specifically, ordinary regimen had a peak of -56,4% in April. Day-hospital admissions were the most affected by Covid-19 with a peak of -84% in April. The largest reduction in hospitalizations occurred in private hospitals, in both ordinary (-81% in April) and DH admissions (-100% in April). A rebound in admissions was reported only for ordinary private regime between June and September, with a peak of + 24% in August. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 had a severe impact on Abruzzo hospitalizations. The medical conditions that we examined needed effective hospital treatment to avoid adverse outcomes or death. Subsequently, fewer hospitalizations for such medical conditions were almost certainly associated with patient harm. Despite the pandemic, health system leaders should manage to provide subjects with hospital care, when necessary.

However, the proper deployment of air filtration has been hampered by an insufficient understanding of its principles. These misconceptions have led to uncertainty about the effectiveness of air filtration at arresting potentially infectious aerosol particles. A correct understanding of how air filtration works is critical for further decision-making regarding its use in managing the spread of COVID-19. The issue is significant because recent evidence has shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can remain airborne longer and travel farther than anticipated earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit with diminishing concentrations and viability. While SARS-CoV-2 virions are around 60-140 nm in diameter, larger respiratory droplets and air pollution particles (>1 m) have been found to harbor the virions. Removing particles that could carry SARS-CoV-2 from the air is possible using air filtration, which relies on the natural or mechanical movement of air. Among various types of air filters, high-efficiency particle arrestance (HEPA) filters have been recommended. Other types of filters are less or more effective and, correspondingly, are easier or harder to move air through. The use of masks, respirators, air filtration modules, and other dedicated equipment is an essential intervention in the management of COVID-19 spread. It is critical to consider the mechanisms of air filtration and to understand how aerosol particles containing SARS-CoV-2 virions interact with filter materials to determine the best practices for the use of air filtration to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Air filtration and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonosis is an infectious disease and a potential bioterrorism agent.

Artificial microRNAs are small molecules which are expressed through endogenous microRNA machinery by RNA polymerase II. These artificial microRNAs effectively inhibit gene expression and are non-toxic to the host cell. VEEV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is central to VEEV replication. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted inhibition of VEEV RdRp using artificial microRNAs may efficiently inhibit VEEV replication. Five artificial microRNAs were tested in vitro in BHK cells. Three of these artificial miRNAs showed significant inhibition of VEEV replication. Further, these microRNAs were cloned into the expression vector in combination to see the synergistic effect on VEEV replication. Combination of more than one miRNA did not result in significant inhibition of virus replication.

Although similar restrictions were introduced in most participants' departments, the supply of personal protective equipment and the outpatient care remained insufficient and should be re-evaluated intensively for future global health care crises.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spine surgery in central Europe: A questionnaire-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus-19 pandemic continues to influence on the hand therapy community. It is important to understand how therapists are currently affected and how things have changed since the onset of the pandemic. PURPOSE: Follow-up on a previous survey and investigate the current status of hand therapy practice 10 months into the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Web-based survey. METHODS: A 38-item survey was electronically delivered to American Society of Hand Therapists members between December 9, 2020 and January 6, 2021. Stress, safety measures, changes in practice patterns and telehealth were focus areas in the survey. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient was used to analyze nonparametric correlations, Chi-Square analysis examined relationships between categorical values and unpaired t-tests were utilized for the comparison of means. RESULTS: Of the 378 respondents, 85% reported higher stress levels compared to pre-pandemic times. Younger therapists expressed more stress over childcare concerns (rs = 0.38;P = .000) and job security (rs = 0.21; P = .000), while older therapists expressed more stress over eldercare concerns (rs= -.13;P = .018). Descriptively, hours spent on direct clinical care were near prepandemic levels. Telehealth is currently used by 29% of respondents and did not correlate to age or years of practice. Postoperative cases (t(423) = 4.18;P = .0001) and people age 50-64-years (t(423) = 3.01;P = .002) were most frequently seen for in person visits. Nontraumatic, nonoperative cases (t(423) = 4.52;P = .0001) as well as those 65 years and older (t(423) = 3.71; P = .0002) were more likely to be seen via telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: Hand therapists are adapting as reflected by the return to near normal work hours and less utilization of telehealth. Respondents still report higher levels of stress compared to prior to the pandemic, and this stress appears to be multifactorial in nature. Weariness with the precautionary measures such as mask wearing, social distancing and sanitizing was expressed through open-ended responses.","output":"A follow up survey on the impact of COVID-19 on hand therapy practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Paramedics may be at an increased risk of interacting with COVID-19-positive individuals, making understanding the factors that influence paramedics' vaccination decisions increasingly important. Objectives We aim to investigate factors that may influence paramedics' likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. Methods Canadian paramedics from five provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan) working during the COVID-19 pandemic were voluntarily recruited through posters, social media, and emails from collaborating paramedic organizations. Participants completed online questionnaires between January and May of 2021 that assessed COVID-19 vaccine status, vaccine hesitancy, and intent to be vaccinated. Differences in proportions tests were used to compare agreement scores, calculated by combining proportions of participants who responded 'strongly agree' and 'agree' to questionnaire items. Results Of the 2178 paramedics recruited, 95.7% completed the questionnaire (76.6% vaccinated). While most participants (89.4%) agreed that people should be vaccinated against COVID-19 and that vaccinations are necessary (94.7%), fewer participants agreed that COVID-19 vaccines are safe (78.5%) as compared to routine vaccines (86.1%, p<0.001), such as influenza vaccinations. However, vaccinated participants were more likely than unvaccinated participants to agree that routine vaccines are safe (90.5% vs. 76.2%, p<0.001) and that COVID-19 vaccines are safe (87.3% vs. 52.4%, p<0.001). Unvaccinated participants were more likely than vaccinated participants to report no intention of being vaccinated (14.2% vs. 0.1%, p<0.001), to report that they would get vaccinated but would wait (22.5% vs. 9.4%, p<0.001), and to report competing priorities were preventing them from getting vaccinated (9.0% vs. 2.4%, p<0.001). Vaccinated participants were more likely to report that they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if recommended by public health experts (90.5% vs. 55.9%, p<0.001). Conclusion Most paramedics believe COVID-19 vaccines to be safe and necessary. However, a sizeable proportion of paramedics reported no intention of getting vaccinated. Further analyses are needed to determine which factors influence their vaccination decisions.","output":"Vaccine hesitancy among canadian paramedics during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses can establish both acute and persistent chronic infections, and some viruses have developed the ability to switch between the two. However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger a transition from a benign chronic infection into pathogenesis remain unknown. Here we investigated the role of the cellular stress response in provoking a chronic-to-acute transition in viral replication in a model of mumps virus infection. Using a combination of cell biology, whole-cell proteomics and cryo-electron tomography we show that stress induces phosphorylation of the disordered viral Phosphoprotein, which we suggest facilitates partitioning of the viral polymerase into preformed viral condensates, constituting the core components of the viral replication machinery. This occurs concomitantly with a conformational change in the viral nucleocapsids that exposes the viral genome and can further facilitate its replication. These changes in the viral condensate upon exogenous stress, accompanied by down-regulation of the host antiviral response, provide an environment that supports up-regulation of viral replication and virion release. Thus, we elucidate molecular and structural mechanisms of a stress-mediated switch that disrupts the equilibrium between the virome and the host in chronic infection.","output":"Condensate-mediated reactivation of mumps virus infection under stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To explore the scope, range, and nature of the existing literature on Mexican women who remain behind in their communities of origin while their partners migrate abroad.

PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: The aim of the study is to describe the formal characteristics and dissemination strategies of audiovisual representations of obstetric violence in France and Belgium. Their place in the history of the media emergence of the concept is described. RESULTS: The result of the study is to qualify as facing (envisagement) the showing of faces in audiovisual representations of obstetrical violence. Seeing the faces of victims underlines their legitimacy, which contributes to the recognition of the concept of obstetric violence.

We sought to investigate the characteristics, inflammatory laboratory finding trends, and outcomes among critically ill Japanese patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed in a single institution in the center of Tokyo. Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from March 19 to April 30, 2020 were included. Trends for significant inflammatory laboratory findings were analyzed. In-hospital death, days of mechanical ventilation or oxygen supplementation, days of ICU or hospital stay were followed until May 26, 2020. Results: Twenty-four patients were included. Median age was 57.5 years, and 79% were male. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was elevated to a median of 10.1 on admission and peaked on Day 10 of illness. Seventeen patients were intubated on Day 11 of illness and received mechanical ventilation. One patient underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The majority (88%) received systemic steroids, including 16 patients who received high dose methylprednisolone (500-1000 mg). Favipiravir was used in 38% of patients. Two patients, including 1 who refused intensive care, died. Eighteen patients were discharged. Median length of ICU and hospital stay for all patients was 6 and 22 days, respectively. Median length of ventilator dependency was 7 days. Four patients underwent a tracheostomy and received prolonged ventilation for more than 21 days. One patient receiving mechanical ventilation died. All survivors discontinued ventilator use. Mortality was remarkably low and prolonged ventilation was inevitable yet discontinued. Conclusions: Mortality was remarkably low in our single institutional study. Prolonged ventilation was inevitable yet discontinued.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the preparedness and capacity of palliative care services in the Middle-East and North Africa region to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was undertaken, with items addressing the WHO International Health Regulations. Non-probabilistic sampling was used, and descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Responses from 43 services in 12 countries were analysed. Half of respondents were doctors (53%), and services were predominantly hospital-based (84%). All but one services had modified at least one procedure to respond to COVID-19. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) policies were modified by a third (30%) and unavailable for a fifth (23%). While handwashing facilities at points of entry were available (98%), a third had concerns over accessing disinfectant products (37%), soap (35%), or running water (33%). The majority had capacity to use technology to provide remote care (86%) and contact lists of patients and staff (93%), though only two-fifths had relatives' details (37%). Respondents reported high staff anxiety about becoming infected themselves (median score 8 on 1-10 scale), but only half of services had a stress management procedure (53%).

In two periods and seasons, marine debris was sampled on nine sandy beaches of Rio de Janeiro, grouped by levels of access. The general marine debris density has decreased over time, accompanied by an improvement in public cleaning mechanisms. The most important predictor for the majority of marine debris items is related to accessibility; beaches with restricted access showed a reduction in the abundance of most items. High marine debris densities, even on beaches with restricted access, showed that all evaluated beaches can be sinks for marine debris circulating in marine waters.

single-stranded RNA viruses with nucleocapsid. SARS-CoV-2 has included four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N);between these proteins, S protein makes attaching ability in the virus. This ability causes the virus to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) and host cell membrane in targeted tissues. Currently, several mutations of SARS-CoV-2 were identified. On the other hand, these new mutations cause SARS-CoV-2 to have different variants with various severity, such as the South African variant (B.1.351) and the UK variant (B.1.1.7). Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, diverse therapeutics routes and prevention assays have been applied, following that several drugs and therapy assays have been investigated. One of the most important routes in this pandemic is the vaccine. Currently, at least in all of the world, almost 13 vaccines have been accepted with different mechanisms against COVID-19. This review explored current mRNA and non-mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and their immunogenicity, safety, and Efficacy.

Controversy and ongoing discussion remains about the validity and appropriateness of teleneuropsychology, but provider and patient risk associated with in-person testing needs to be considered when cognitive evaluation is warranted. We describe the remote evaluation of a man hospitalized with altered mental status and positive COVID-19 infection and the effectiveness of teleneuropsychology in clarifying cognition/assisting clinical management in a non-English-speaking individual with limited formal education. METHOD: 35 year old Spanish-speaking male with no formal education referred for inpatient neuropsychological consultation to rule in/rule out possible encephalopathy and confirm premorbid cognitive functioning. Cognitive evaluation completed using iPad and Zoom technology at bedside. RESULTS: Tele-neuropsychology was conducted in the patients primary language without the necessity for PPE, which enabled improved engagement. Although testing had to be modified; the environment could not be controlled; and all cognitive domains could not be evaluatedremote evaluation confirmed fluctuations and variability, both within and between tasks, with notable fluxes in attention, comprehension and speech.

However, the global consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation rates and the effect on waitlisted patients have not been reported. We aimed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation and investigate if the pandemic was associated with heterogeneous adaptation in terms of organ transplantation, with ensuing consequences for waitlisted patients. METHODS: In this population-based, observational, before-and-after study, we collected and validated nationwide cohorts of consecutive kidney, liver, lung, and heart transplants from 22 countries. Data were collected from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2020, along with data from the same period in 2019. The analysis was done from the onset of the 100th cumulative COVID-19 case through to Dec 31, 2020. We assessed the effect of the pandemic on the worldwide organ transplantation rate and the disparity in transplant numbers within each country. We estimated the number of waitlisted patient life-years lost due to the negative effects of the pandemic. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04416256. FINDINGS: Transplant activity in all countries studied showed an overall decrease during the pandemic. Kidney transplantation was the most affected, followed by lung, liver, and heart. We identified three organ transplant rate patterns, as follows: countries with a sharp decrease in transplantation rate with a low COVID-19-related death rate; countries with a moderate decrease in transplantation rate with a moderate COVID-19-related death rate; and countries with a slight decrease in transplantation rate despite a high COVID-19-related death rate. Temporal trends revealed a marked worldwide reduction in transplant activity during the first 3 months of the pandemic, with losses stabilising after June, 2020, but decreasing again from October to December, 2020. The overall reduction in transplants during the observation time period translated to 48 239 waitlisted patient life-years lost. INTERPRETATION: We quantified the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on worldwide organ transplantation activity and revealed heterogeneous adaptation in terms of organ transplantation, both at national levels and within countries, with detrimental consequences for waitlisted patients. Understanding how different countries and health-care systems responded to COVID-19-related challenges could facilitate improved pandemic preparedness, notably, how to safely maintain transplant programmes, both with immediate and non-immediate life-saving potential, to prevent loss of patient life-years.

To predict the epidemic tendency, we consider four groups of people, and establish a propagation dynamics model. We also create a negative feedback to quantify the public vigilance to the epidemic. We evaluate the tendency of epidemic in Hubei and China except Hubei separately to predict the situation of the whole country. Experiments show that the epidemic will terminate around 17 March 2020 and the final number of cumulative infections will be about 78 191 (prediction interval, 74 872 to 82 474).

We also consider the effect of protective gears and practices, crowd density, and prevalence of disease in the community on the possible number of newly-infected individuals. Our simulations show that (i) individuals must have protection with more than 90% effectiveness to inhibit transmission of the disease; (ii) social or physical distancing by more than 1m distance reduces the risk of being infected; (iii) minimizing movement or interaction with other passengers reduces the risk of transmission by 50%; (iv) passenger capacity should be less than 10-50% of the maximum seating capacity to reduce the number of infections depending on the level of imposed social distancing and passenger interaction; (v) vehicles with greater number of occupied seating capacity generate higher number of infections but vehicles with smaller dimensions have faster disease transmissions; and (vi) ideal set-up for a 24-seater train wagon (49-seater bus) is to allow a maximum of 12 (24) passengers, with little to no interaction among passengers, with social distancing of more than 1m distance apart, and each person has a protection with 90% effectiveness as much as possible.

A severe course with fatal outcome is possible and unpredictable. OBJECTIVES: Which organ systems are predominantly involved? Which diseases are predisposed for a fatal course? Which organ changes are found with lethal outcome? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from published autopsy studies (28 cases by our group) with respect to organ changes and possible cause of death. RESULTS: The most severe alterations are found in the lungs by diffuse alveolar damage as a symptom of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in part with fibrosis. Thrombosis of small- to mid-sized pulmonary arteries is associated with hemorrhagic lung infarction. Frequent complications are bacterial pneumonias and less frequently fungal pneumonias by aspergillus. Pulmonary thromboembolism is found in 20-30% of lethal courses, also in the absence of deep venous thrombosis. Intestinal involvement of COVID-19 can be associated with intestinal ischemia, caused by shock or local thrombosis. In most cases, the kidneys display acute tubular injury reflecting acute renal failure, depletion of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and spleen, and hyperplastic adrenal glands. The liver frequently reveals steatosis, liver cell necrosis, portal inflammation, and proliferation of Kupffer cells. Important preexisting diseases in autopsy studies are arterial hypertension with hypertensive and ischemic cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus but large population-based studies reveal increased risk of mortality only for diabetes mellitus not for arterial hypertension.

In this study, neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 were assessed one month after completed prime-boost vaccine regimens in health-care workers vaccinated with either mRNACmRNA (Comirnaty?, BioNTech-Pfzier, Mainz, Germany/New York, NY, USA, n = 98) or vector-based (Vaxzevria?, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK) followed by mRNA-based (Comirnaty? or Spikevax?, Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA) vaccines (n = 16). Vaccine-induced neutralization titers were compared to time-matched, unvaccinated individuals that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and presented with mild symptoms (n = 38). Significantly higher neutralizing titers were found in both the mRNACmRNA (ID50: 2525, IQR: 1667C4313) and vectorCmRNA (ID50: 4978, IQR: 3364C7508) prime-boost vaccine regimens when compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection (ID50: 401, IQR: 271C792) (p < 0.0001). However, infection with SARS-CoV-2 induced higher titers when compared to a single dose of Vaxzevria? (p = 0.0072). Between mRNACmRNA and vectorCmRNA prime-boost regimens, the vectorCmRNA vaccine regimen induced higher neutralization titers (p = 0.0054). Demographically, both age and time between vaccination doses were associated with vaccine-induced neutralization titers (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). This warrants further investigation into the optimal time to administer booster vaccination for optimized induction of neutralizing responses. Although anecdotal (n = 3), those with exposure to SARS-CoV-2, either before or after vaccination, demonstrated superior neutralizing titers, which is suggestive of further boosting through viral exposure.","output":"Analysis of Neutralization Titers against SARS-CoV-2 in Health-Care Workers Vaccinated with Prime-Boost mRNACmRNA or VectorCmRNA COVID-19 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article gives a bird's-eye view on how the 2nd-most populous country, that is, India, is fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a newly developed device for endolumenal colon occlusion (ColoShield) in an acute porcine model. METHODS The principle of the ColoShield device is based on two balloons, with negative pressure in between. The ColoShield device and a gauze tamponade as a control group were evaluated in a non-survival study on 16 pigs. The efficacy of the occlusion system in establishing a leak-proof pneumorectum and in sealing the colon from proximal (watertight sealing) was tested by a standardized study course. Finally, the colon/rectum was explanted for macroscopic and microscopic examination. RESULTS A 20-mmHg leak-proof pneumorectum over a period of 10 min could be achieved in seven of eight (87 %) animals with the ColoShield device and in none of eight (0 %) animals with gauze tamponade (p < 0.001). In the watertight sealing test, mean intracolonic pressures of 23.5  18.1 (0-53) mmHg using the ColoShield device and 0  1.1 (0-3) mmHg using gauze tamponade (p = 0.003) were documented proximal to the occlusion system before a leakage occurred. Macroscopic and histopathological examinations revealed no significant impairment of the colon specimen in either group.

METHODS: Ninety-five consecutive patients (11 male, 84 female; mean BMI 45  6 kg/m2) undergoing RYGB 9  4 years ago were treated for 24 months as follows: Patients, who gained less than 10% from weight NADIR, served as controls and were provided lifestyle counseling (DC, n = 30). The others were allowed to choose between three different treatment groups: daily s.c. administration of liraglutide (LG, n = 34); endosurgery using Apollo's Overstitch System&#8482; (ES, n = 15), or implantation of a Fobi-ring with pouch resizing (FP, n = 16). RESULTS: Controls kept their weight stable during 24 months of study (- 0.1  1.7 kg/m2). Weight loss was 4.8  2.9 kg/m2 for LG and 5.5  2.9 kg/m2 for FP, both losing more than 85% of regained weight from weight NADIR (p < 0.001). In contrast, weight loss in ES was 1.0  0.9 kg/m2 (i.e., 20% of regained weight). Thirty-seven percent of FP experienced serious complications (p < 0.05) in contrast to the other groups. An improved prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia was observed in LG and FP (p < 0.02) 24 months after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Weight regain during more than 6 years after RYGB can be safely and effectively reversed with liraglutide. Compared with revisional surgery, pharmacotherapy with liraglutide was low risk and resulted in an important improvement in hypertension and dyslipidemia. Therefore, daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide are a valid option to treat weight regain after RYGB.","output":"Reversal of Long-Term Weight Regain After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Using Liraglutide or Surgical Revision.

The aim of this study was to investigate and analyze the social and occupational effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in three different countries: China, Spain, and Cuba. Methods A cross-sectional survey was designed to assess the social and occupational effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in MS patients in these three countries, using a 25-item anonymous online questionnaire, structured into three sections. Quantitative data are expressed as mean (standard deviation), and quantitative data as absolute frequency and percentage. Results A total of 361 participants responded to the questionnaire: 194 from China, 104 from Spain, and 63 from Cuba. We found no cases of COVID-19 among Chinese patients with MS, and few cases in Spain and Cuba. Respondents reported different levels of impact on relationships with friends, family, and colleagues, and patients in all three countries described increased use of digital or social media platforms. Spanish patients reported a significantly less negative impact than those in Cuba and China. Mental and cognitive effects were similar in all three countries, although China seemed to have a better situation. We also found that the time spent exercising decreased at specific points during the pandemic, but with few changes in dietary habits. Patients reported little or no change in their means of transport in all three countries. Most patients in all three countries reported little or no physical deterioration, especially in Chinese patients (82.47%), compared to the Spanish (70.20%) and Cuban respondents (73.02%). In general, patients from all three countries demonstrated confidence in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic, although to a lesser extent among Spanish respondents. Conclusions During the pandemic, family support was more effective in China than in Cuba and Spain. Neither COVID-19 infections nor the number of MS relapses increased significantly during lockdown in any of the three countries. Regarding their economic situation, Spanish MS patients reported a significantly less severe negative impact than those in Cuba and China. Patients from all three countries used digital or social media platforms more frequently, probably to maintain personal relationships. Chinese and Cuban respondents were more confident of the control of the pandemic than the Spanish, who were more pessimistic.","output":"The social and occupational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among patients with multiple sclerosis in three distinct populations: A web-based cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moderate diastereoselectivities (d.e. 2-62%) of isoxazolidine homonucleotides were observed for cycloadditions between N-methyl-C-(diethoxyphosphoryl)nitrone and N-allyl nucleobases, with trans-isoxazolidines predominating.

Some of our participants showed depressive and anxious attitudes even in the absence of real pictures of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon, combined with mechanisms of emulation and conditioning, can trigger a vicious cycle within interpersonal relationships and promote the administration of unnecessary treatments. Various approaches have been proposed to help populations suffering from psychosocial problems induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, but there is an objective difficulty in treating a large population. METHODS: To contain and reduce this widespread psychosocial unease, in this study we used two radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology neuromodulation treatments, neuro postural optimization (NPO) and neuropsychophysical optimizationCcervicobrachial (NPPO-CB), aimed at optimizing an individuals response to the effects of environmental stressors. These treatments are quick and easy to administer; therefore, they can be administered to a large cohort of participants in a short time. To evaluate the effects of the REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments, the DASS-21 psychometric test was used because it has already been used to test depression, anxiety, and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The results of the study confirm the usefulness of REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments in helping participants to have better coping strategies for the environmental pressures and reduce the neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Objective: To assess the performance of a severity scoring system on admission CXR in predicting hospital outcomes in patients admitted with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study included 240 patients (142 men, 98 women; median age 65 [50-80]) admitted to the hospital from 3/16/2020 to 4/30/2020 with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and who underwent CXR within 24 hours of admission. Three chest radiologists and three radiology residents independently scored patients' admission CXR using a 0 to 24-point composite scale (sum of 0-3 scores for extent and severity of disease in upper and lower lung zones). The score's interrater reliability score was assessed using Kendall's W statistic. The six readers' scores were averaged for further analyses. Demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and admission laboratory values were collected from the electronic medical record. ROC analysis was performed to assess the association of CXR severity and mortality. Additional univariable associations, as well as multivariable logistic regression models incorporating patient characteristics and laboratory values, were tested between CXR severity and clinical outcomes. Results: Interrater reliability of the CXR scores ranged from 0.687 to 0.737 for attendings, 0.653 to 0.762 for residents, and 0.575 to 0.666 for all readers combined. Admission CXR score &#8805; 10 achieved 53.0% (35/66) sensitivity and 75.3% (131/174) specificity for predicting hospital mortality.

Here, we analyze the relationships between viral genetic variants and clinical characteristics in children. Methods: Whole-genome sequencing was performed on respiratory specimens collected for all SARS-CoV-2-positive children (n = 141) between March 13 and June 16, 2020. Viral genetic variations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome were identified and investigated to evaluate genomic correlates of disease severity. Results: Higher viral load was detected in symptomatic patients (P = .0007) and in children &lt;5 years old (P = .0004). Genomic analysis revealed a mean pairwise difference of 10.8 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and the majority (55.4%) of SNVs led to an amino acid change in the viral proteins. The D614G mutation in the spike protein was present in 99.3% of the isolates. The calculated viral mutational rate of 22.2 substitutions/year contrasts the 13.5 substitutions/year observed in California isolates without the D614G mutation. Phylogenetic clade 20C was associated with severe cases of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 6.95;P = .0467). Epidemiological investigation revealed major representation of 3 of 5 major Nextstrain clades (20A, 20B, and 20C) consistent with multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Southern California. Conclusions: Genomic evaluation demonstrated greater than expected genetic diversity, presence of the D614G mutation, increased mutation rate, and evidence of multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Southern California. Our findings suggest a possible association of phylogenetic clade 20C with severe disease, but small sample size precludes a definitive conclusion.

METHODS Data from the Mortality Information System were used. Expected deaths for 2020 were estimated from 2015 to 2019 data using a negative binomial log-linear model. RESULTS Excess deaths in Brazil in 2020 amounted to 13.7%, and the ratio of excess deaths to COVID-19 deaths was 0.90. Reductions in deaths from cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respiratory diseases, and external causes, and an increase in ill-defined causes were all noted. Excess deaths were also found to be heterogeneous, being higher in the Northern, Center-Western, and Northeastern states. In some states, the number of COVID-19 deaths was lower than that of excess deaths, whereas the opposite occurred in others. Moreover, excess deaths were higher in men aged 20 to 59, and in black, yellow, or indigenous individuals. Meanwhile, excess mortality was lower in women, in individuals aged 80 years or older, and in whites. Additionally, deaths among those aged 0 to 19 were 7.2% lower than expected, with reduction in mortality from respiratory diseases and external causes. There was also a drop in mortality due to external causes in men and in those aged 20 to 39 years. Moreover, reductions in deaths from CVD and neoplasms were noted in some states and groups. CONCLUSION There is evidence of underreporting of COVID-19 deaths and of the possible impact of restrictive measures in the reduction of deaths from external causes and respiratory diseases. The impacts of COVID-19 on mortality were heterogeneous among the states and groups, revealing that regional, demographic, socioeconomic, and racial differences expose individuals in distinct ways to the risk of death from both COVID-19 and other causes.","output":"Excess deaths from all causes and by COVID-19 in Brazil in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have shown that infection-related cytokine increase of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF- &#945;) can cause suppression of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes.1 SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with increased cytokine levels which may suggest suppression of CYP3A4 enzymes and downstream interaction with CYP-mediated drug metabolism including calcineurin inhibitors.","output":"Practical Consideration for Drug Monitoring of Tacrolimus in Liver Transplantation Recipients with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident that viral spread is mediated through several different transmission pathways.

To quantify viral repellency, we developed a touch-based viral quantification assay to mimic the interaction of a contaminated human touch with a surface through the modification of traditional viral quantification methods (viral plaque and TCID50 assays). These studies demonstrate that RepelWrap reduced contamination with an enveloped DNA virus as well as the human coronavirus 229E (HuCoV-229E) by more than 4 log 10 (>99.99%) compared to a standard commercially available polyethylene plastic wrap. In addition, RepelWrap maintained its repellent properties after repeated 300 touches and did not show an accumulation in viral titer after multiple contacts with contaminated surfaces, while increases were seen on other commonly used surfaces. These findings show the potential use of repellent surfaces in reducing viral contamination on surfaces, which could, in turn, reduce the surface-based spread and transmission.","output":"Pathogen-Repellent Plastic Warp with Built-In Hierarchical Structuring Prevents the Contamination of Surfaces with Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dental hygienists are in high demand due to insufficient workforce and a lack of an effective reinstatement support system.

Our goal is to detect the socially occupied spaces, i.e., spaces not physically occupied by subjects and objects but inhabited by the interaction they sustain. We evaluate the social representation of the space structure between two or more active participants, so-called F-Formation for small gatherings.

In contrast, there was no significant association between IFN- levels and the presence of pneumonia or RNAemia, despite showing a stronger association with nasal-swab viral load (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis showed that the serum levels of IFN- significantly correlated with those of IFN-, IL-6, and CXCL10, while the levels of IFN- did not correlate with those of IL-6 or CXCL10. Conclusions Serum IFN-I levels in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher in patients who developed hypoxemic respiratory failure. The association between IFN-, IL-6, and CXCL10 may reflect the systemic immune response against SARS-CoV-2 invasion into pulmonary circulation, which might be an early predictor of respiratory failure due to COVID-19.","output":"Circulating Type I Interferon Levels in the Early Phase of COVID-19 Are Associated With the Development of Respiratory Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Goal The E / (EaSa) index is an echocardiographic parameter to determine a patient's left ventricular filling pressure. This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of the echocardiographic E / (EaSa) index guided diuretic therapy compared to urine output (conventional) guided diuretic treatment.Material and Methods In this cross-sectional study, patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were hospitalized due to acute decompensation episode were consecutively allocated in a 1:1 ratio to monitoring arms. The diuretic dose, which provided 20 % reduction in the E / (EaSa) index value compared to initial value, was determined as adequate dose in echocardiography guided monitoring group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), change in weight, NT pro-BNP level and dyspnea assessment on visual analogue scale (VAS) were analyzed at the end of the monitoring.Results Although the similar doses of diuretics were used in both groups, the patients with E / (EaSa) index guided strategy had the substantial lower NT pro-BNP level within 72 hours after diuretic administration (2172 vs.2514 pg / mL, p= 0.036). VAS score on dyspnea assessment was significantly better in the patients with E / (EaSa) index guided strategy (52 vs. 65; p= 0.04). And, in term of body weight loss (4.93 vs.5.21 kg, p=0.87) and e-GFR (54.588.6 vs. 52.659.1 mL / min / 1.73 m2p=0.74) in both groups are associated with similar outcomes. In both groups, there was no worsening renal function and electrolyte imbalance that required stopping or decreasing loop diuretic dosing.Conclusions The E / (EaSa) index guidance might be a safe strategy for more effective diuretic response that deserves consideration for selected a subgroup of acute decomposed HFrEF patients.","output":"Approach to decongestion therapy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: the echocardiography guided strategy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable food security due to climate and social change is more important than ever.

Various treatments have been evaluated over the years. However, a clear overview is lacking. The objective of this study was to systematically review all pharmacotherapeutical strategies in the prevention of VOCs beyond hydroxyurea. We performed a systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL). Eligible studies were controlled clinical trials evaluating pharmacotherapeutical interventions targeting the reduction of VOCs in patients with SCD. Primary outcomes were the number or duration of SCD-related pain days, VOCs, or hospital admissions for VOCs. Secondary outcomes included time to first VOC or hospital admission for a VOC. A standardized data extraction sheet was used. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool. A total of 36 studies were included in this review, covering 26 different prophylactic interventions. The most promising interventions for reducing the frequency of either VOCs or hospitalizations were the oral antioxidants l-glutamine and -3 fatty acids and the IV antiadhesive agent crizanlizumab. Twenty-three studies did not show any beneficial effect of the intervention under investigation, and 6 studies were either too small or methodologically inadequate to draw conclusions. Because of the heterogeneity of interventions, no meta-analysis was performed. In conclusion, this review identified 3 promising pharmacotherapeutical strategies in the prevention of VOCs in SCD.

This study aims to develop a theory that attempts to explain the older adults' resiliency perspectives during crisis and how it has affected their well-being and quality of life as population group. Deductive theory generation using axiomatic approach was adopted resulting to five axioms that served as basis for the generation of three propositions such as: (1) An older person's health needs have tendencies to develop into a health threat, (2) when the threat is perceived, older persons developed a sense of internal control and adaptation to the changes it creates known as internal resiliency, and (3) internal resiliency can influence the quality of life in old age. The evolved theory suggests that in times of crisis (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), health needs develop into a health threat that compels older persons to develop internal resiliency in order to preserve their integrity, wellbeing and quality of life. This study widens the nursing perspectives in addressing older persons' resiliency by the unique condition at which older clients are placed affecting both the pathological nature of the illness as well as the preventive interventions which the society is forced to implement.","output":"The development of Need-Threat Internal Resiliency Theory in COVID-19 crisis utilizing deductive axiomatic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the effects of wearing a simulated mask on speech perception of normal-hearing subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Fifteen normal-hearing, native German speakers (8 female, 7 male). INTERVENTION: Different experimental conditions with and without simulated face masks using the audiovisual version of the female German Matrix test (Oldenburger Satztest, OLSA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at speech intelligibility of 80%. RESULTS: The SNR at which 80% speech intelligibility was achieved deteriorated by a mean of 4.1 dB SNR when simulating a medical mask and by 5.1 dB SNR when simulating a cloth mask in comparison to the audiovisual condition without mask. Interestingly, the contribution of the visual component alone was 2.6 dB SNR and thus had a larger effect than the acoustic component in the medical mask condition. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, speech understanding with face masks was significantly worse than under control conditions. Thus, the speaker's use of face masks leads to a significant deterioration of speech understanding by the normal-hearing listener.

RECOMMENDATIONS: The first version on this living guidance focuses on corticosteroids. It contains a strong recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe and critical covid-19, and a weak or conditional recommendation against systemic corticosteroids in patients with non-severe covid-19. Corticosteroids are inexpensive and are on the World Health Organisation list of essential medicines. HOW: this guideline was created This guideline reflects an innovative collaboration between the WHO and the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation, driven by an urgent need for global collaboration to provide trustworthy and living covid-19 guidance. A standing international panel of content experts, patients, clinicians, and methodologists, free from relevant conflicts of interest, produce recommendations for clinical practice. The panel follows standards, methods, processes, and platforms for trustworthy guideline development using the GRADE approach. We apply an individual patient perspective while considering contextual factors (that is, resources, feasibility, acceptability, equity) for countries and healthcare systems. THE EVIDENCE: A living systematic review and network meta-analysis, supported by a prospective meta-analysis, with data from eight randomised trials (7184 participants) found that systemic corticosteroids probably reduce 28 day mortality in patients with critical covid-19 (moderate certainty evidence; 87 fewer deaths per 1000 patients (95% confidence interval 124 fewer to 41 fewer)), and also in those with severe disease (moderate certainty evidence; 67 fewer deaths per 1000 patients (100 fewer to 27 fewer)). In contrast, systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of death in patients without severe covid-19 (low certainty evidence; absolute effect estimate 39 more per 1000 patients, (12 fewer to 107 more)). Systemic corticosteroids probably reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and harms are likely to be minor (indirect evidence). UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS: The panel made a strong recommendation for use of corticosteroids in severe and critical covid-19 because there is a lower risk of death among people treated with systemic corticosteroids (moderate certainty evidence), and they believe that all or almost all fully informed patients with severe and critical covid-19 would choose this treatment. In contrast, the panel concluded that patients with non-severe covid-19 would decline this treatment because they would be unlikely to benefit and may be harmed. Moreover, taking both a public health and a patient perspective, the panel warned that indiscriminate use of any therapy for covid-19 would potentially rapidly deplete global resources and deprive patients who may benefit from it most as potentially lifesaving therapy. UPDATES: This is a living guideline. Work is under way to evaluate other interventions. New recommendations will be published as updates to this guideline.

This study is designed in this regard. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between January 20, 2020 and January 20, 2021 in the emergency departments of two hospitals in Hamadan and Kermanshah, Iran. Participants were 487 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and cardiac arrest (CA) who had undergone CPR during the study period. Data were collected using the available CPR documentation forms developed based on the Utstein Style and analyses were performed using Chi-square, Fishers exact, and Mann-Whitney U tests and the logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Participants mean age was 69.3114.73 years and most of them were male (61.8%) and suffered from at least one underlying disease (58.1%). The rate of total and in-hospital CA was 9.67% and 9.39%, respectively. The most prevalent first documented rhythm was asystole (67.9%) and the highest responsivity to CPR was for shockable rhythms. The rate of the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was 9% and the rate of survival to hospital discharge was 2%. The significant predictors of CPR success were age (p = 0.035), epinephrine administration time interval (p = 0.00), CPR duration (p = 0.00), and First documented rhythm (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: The rate of in-hospital CA among studied COVID-19 cases was 9.39% with 9% ROSC and 2% survival to hospital discharge rates after CPR. Primary CPR success among patients with COVID-19 was poor, particularly among those with asystole and bradycardia. It seems that old age and improper doses of epinephrine can reduce CPR success.","output":"Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19; a One-Year Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer amongst women globally and it accounts for the majority of cancer deaths among females in Zimbabwe. The objective of this midterm review analysis was to identify the gaps and opportunities for cervical cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care to inform the next cervical cancer strategy in Zimbabwe. METHODS: A mixed methods approach was used for the midterm review. Secondary data was collected from programme documents, published and grey literature. Primary data was collected in six provinces through key informant interviews with officials and focus group discussions with beneficiaries. After data analysis, a draft report was presented to a technical working group to validate the findings and to fill in any gaps. RESULTS: This midterm review revealed a myriad of gaps of the strategy particularly in diagnosis, treatment and care of cervical cancer and the primary focus was on secondary prevention. There was no data to quantify the level of awareness and advocacy for cervical cancer prevention. Our results revealed that there was no data on the proportion of women who ever tested for cervical cancer which existed nationally. Our findings suggest that some health facilities were screening women above 50 years old using VIAC, which is an inappropriate approach for those women. Quality control of VIAC and treatment of precancers were not part of the strategy. Pathological services were not efficient and effective due to lack of resources and additionally data on investigations were not routinely collected and available at the national level. Other gaps identified were limited funding, human resources, equipment, and commodities as well as lack of leadership at the national level to coordinate the various components of the cervical cancer programme. There are also numerous opportunities identified to build upon some successes realized to date. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasized the importance of effective and holistic planning in cervical cancer screening programmes in low-resource settings. In addition, huge investments are required in cervical cancer programmes and governments need to take centre role in mobilizing the requisite resources.","output":"Gaps and opportunities for cervical cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care: evidence from midterm review of the Zimbabwe cervical Cancer prevention and control strategy (2016C2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main antiviral drug-cyclodextrin interactions, changes in physicochemical and physiological properties of the most commonly used virucides are summarized.

Whilst instigating informal backchannels of communication can help reduce inequities, in-class students remain at a distinct advantage over online students because of their physical and social proximity to teaching staff.

Purpose : The purpose of this study was to determine the prolonged implications of SARS-CoV-2 on carotid stiffness, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and pulse wave analysis (PWA) three months after infection. We hypothesized PWVcf, carotid stiffness, and PWA measures would decrease three months after contracting SARS-CoV-2. Methods : We assessed 7 young adults (4M/3F) at baseline (3-4 weeks after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2) and at 1-month and 2-month follow-up visits. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess carotid distensibility, stiffness, carotid intima media thickness, and PWVcf. Sphygmocor was utilized to determine carotid distensibility and aortic augmentation (AIx), as well as brachial and aortic arterial pressures.

It is associated with significant socioeconomic burden and poor quality of life, mainly due to knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and related total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Since early detection method and disease-modifying drug is lacking, the key of KOA treatment is shifting to disease prevention and progression slowing. The prognostic prediction models are called for to guide clinical decision-making. The aim of our review is to identify and characterize reported multivariable prognostic models for KOA about three clinical concerns: (1) the risk of developing KOA in the general population, (2) the risk of receiving TKA in KOA patients, and (3) the outcome of TKA in KOA patients who plan to receive TKA. METHODS: The electronic datasets (PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, SportDiscus, and CINAHL) and gray literature sources (OpenGrey, British Library Inside, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, and BIOSIS preview) will be searched from their inception onwards. Title and abstract screening and full-text review will be accomplished by two independent reviewers. The multivariable prognostic models that concern on (1) the risk of developing KOA in the general population, (2) the risk of receiving TKA in KOA patients, and (3) the outcome of TKA in KOA patients who plan to receive TKA will be included. Data extraction instrument and critical appraisal instrument will be developed before formal assessment and will be modified during a training phase in advance. Study reporting transparency, methodological quality, and risk of bias will be assessed according to the TRIPOD statement, CHARMS checklist, and PROBAST tool, respectively. Prognostic prediction models will be summarized qualitatively. Quantitative metrics on the predictive performance of these models will be synthesized with meta-analyses if appropriate. DISCUSSION: Our systematic review will collate evidence from prognostic prediction models that can be used through the whole process of KOA. The review may identify models which are capable of allowing personalized preventative and therapeutic interventions to be precisely targeted at those individuals who are at the highest risk. To accomplish the prediction models to cross the translational gaps between an exploratory research method and a valued addition to precision medicine workflows, research recommendations relating to model development, validation, or impact assessment will be made.

In India, it started with milder presentation affecting younger population. Later on, an increase in disease severity was observed involving older age group as well. However, there is a paucity of published data regarding patients requiring ICU care in India. This case series describes the initial experience of an ICU in India regarding epidemiological profile, clinical course, and outcome of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This case series included 27 consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted in a tertiary care ICU over 14 days period, followed up till their discharge from ICU. Demographic and clinical data, including laboratory and radiological findings, were compiled with special attention to co-morbidities of the patients. The management of these patients was done as per the institutional protocol for critically ill COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 50 years with no difference in gender. Comorbid conditions were seen in 85% of the patients with diabetes (43.7%) and hypertension (37.5%) as the most common conditions. The median duration of symptoms before admission was 6 days with fever as the most common clinical symptom at presentation.

To quantify and describe the impact of a number of prognostic factors, including frailty and inflammatory markers. SETTING: Five acute National Health Service Hospitals in east London. DESIGN: Prospectively defined observational study using registry data. PARTICIPANTS: 1737 patients aged 16 years or over admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 January and 13 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of first hospital admission with COVID-19 diagnosis during or prior to admission. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital length of stay and type and duration of organ support. Multivariable survival analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared with white patients, those from minority ethnic backgrounds were younger, with differing comorbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, (95% CI 1.06 to 2.23); p=0.023 and OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.71); p=0.005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1.49 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.86); p<0.001) and black (HR 1.30 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.65); p=0.036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk factor-adjusted analyses accounting for major comorbidities, obesity, smoking, frailty and ABO blood group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds had higher mortality from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders and frailty. Higher rates of invasive ventilation indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19.","output":"Ethnicity and outcomes in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection in East London: an observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Early supported discharge (ESD) aims to link acute and community care, allowing hospital inpatients to return home and continue to receive the necessary input from healthcare professionals that they would otherwise receive in hospital. The concept has been researched extensively in the stroke population, showing reduced length of stay for patients and improved functional outcomes. This systematic review aims to explore the totality of evidence for the use of ESD in an older adult population who have been hospitalised with medical complaints. METHODS: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials and quasi randomised controlled trials will be carried out in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies will be included if they provide an ESD intervention to older adults admitted to hospital for medical complaints compared with continuing inpatient care. MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL and EMBASE databases will be searched. The primary outcome measure will be length of hospital stay, secondary outcomes will include functional abilities, falls, quality of life, carer and patient satisfaction, unplanned emergency department re-presentation, unscheduled hospital readmission, nursing home admission or mortality. Titles and abstracts of studies will be screened independently by two authors. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be used independently by two reviewers to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. GRADE will be used to assess the quality of the body of evidence. A pooled meta-analysis will be conducted using RevMan software V.5.4.1, depending on the uniformity of the data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The authors will present the findings of the review to a patient and public involvement stakeholder panel of older people that has been established at the Ageing Research Centre in the University of Limerick. Formal ethical approval is not required for the review as all data collected will be secondary data and will be analysed anonymously.

Although African governments and other stakeholders are making efforts to contain the pandemic, the outbreak continues to impact human rights and exacerbates inequalities and disparities that are already in existence. The concept of inclusive health focuses on good health and well-being for everyone, and this entails health services that are equitable, affordable, and efficacious. Creating equitable access to mainstream health and healthcare services and ensuring inclusive health responses remain a means of addressing health inequities and disparities. In this article, we argue on the need for inclusive responses to public health emergencies in Africa using COVID-19 as a case example. Africas response to public health emergencies needs to recognize that for every marginalized/vulnerable group, it is important to strategize to address their particular needs in such a way to surmount any barrier to the right to health. For Africas public health response to be more inclusive, we therefore need to be more strategic and proactive in reaching out to specific groups and to identify and address their needs. Strengthening the healthcare systems of African countries through increased political will, increased funding to health care, collaboration and cooperation among stakeholders, and effective leadership remains essential in ensuring inclusive responses to health emergencies.","output":"COVID-19 Highlights the Need for Inclusive Responses to Public Health Emergencies in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines depend primarily on the vaccine recipient and the virus similarity to the endemic virus. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and cytokines are known to restrict immune responses against viral infections. We conducted this study to explore the role of Tregs, cytokines, and antibody production after influenza vaccination. The whole blood was collected from healthy subjects (n = 36) before and two weeks after influenza vaccine immunization for two or three consecutive years. The cell surface markers, intracellular staining of Foxp3(+) Tregs, and Th1/Th2 cytokines were determined. The antibody titer was detected using the hemagglutination inhibition test. The CD3(+), CD127(+), CD4(+)CD25(+) and CD4(+)Foxp3(+) cells were increased significantly post vaccination. The plasma level of the transforming growth factor (TGF-), but not interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-, TNF-, was also found to increase significantly after vaccination. We further correlated the cytokine fold-increases with the anti-influenza antibody titer for individual post vaccination. It was found that the IL-10 level after vaccination correlated with the fold-increases of anti-H1N1, anti-H3N2, anti-B/Yamagata, and anti-B/Victoria antibodies. But, a negative relationship occurs between the TGF- level and fold-increases of anti-H1N1, anti-H3N2, anti-B/Yamagata, and anti-B/Victoria antibodies post vaccination.

However, one of the issues is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of PDLSCs for clinical application because very few PDLSCs can be isolated from PDL tissue of donors. Therefore, we aimed to identify a specific factor that converts human PDL cells into stem-like cells. In this study, microarray analysis comparing the gene profiles of human PDLSC lines (2-14 and 2-23) with those of a cell line with a low differentiation potential (2-52) identified the imprinted gene mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST). MEST was expressed in the cytoplasm of 2-23 cells. Knockdown of MEST by siRNA in 2-23 cells inhibited the expression of stem cell markers, such as CD105, CD146, p75NTR, N-cadherin, and NANOG; the proliferative potential; and multidifferentiation capacity for osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. On the other hand, overexpression of MEST in 2-52 cells enhanced the expression of stem cell markers and PDL-related markers and the multidifferentiation capacity. In addition, MEST-overexpressing 2-52 cells exhibited a change in morphology from a spindle shape to a stem cell-like round shape that was similar to 2-14 and 2-23 cell morphologies. These results suggest that MEST plays a critical role in the maintenance of stemness in PDLSCs and converts PDL cells into PDLSC-like cells. Therefore, this study indicates that MEST may be a therapeutic factor for periodontal tissue regeneration by inducing PDLSCs.","output":"MEST Regulates the Stemness of Human Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate predictions of the droplet transport, evolution, and deposition in human airways are critical for the quantitative analysis of the health risks due to the exposure to the airborne pollutant or virus transmission. The droplet/particle-vapor interaction, i.e., the evaporation or condensation of the multi-component droplet/particle, is one of the key mechanisms that need to be precisely modeled. Using a validated computational model, the transport, evaporation, hygroscopic growth, and deposition of multi-component droplets were simulated in a simplified airway geometry. A mucus-tissue layer is explicitly modeled in the airway geometry to describe mucus evaporation and heat transfer. Pulmonary flow and aerosol dynamics patterns associated with different inhalation flow rates are visualized and compared. Investigated variables include temperature distributions, relative humidity (RH) distributions, deposition efficiencies, droplet/particle distributions, and droplet growth ratio distributions. Numerical results indicate that the droplet/particle-vapor interaction and the heat and mass transfer of the mucus-tissue layer must be considered in the computational lung aerosol dynamics study, since they can significantly influence the precise predictions of the aerosol transport and deposition. Furthermore, the modeling framework in this study is ready to be expanded to predict transport dynamics of cough/sneeze droplets starting from their generation and transmission in the indoor environment to the deposition in the human respiratory system.","output":"Modeling of the transport, hygroscopic growth, and deposition of multi-component droplets in a simplified airway with realistic thermal boundary conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common viral pathogen that causes lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children globally. In this study, we developed a duplex reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (duplex-rtRAA) assay containing an internal control in a single closed tube for the detection of human RSV. The internal control in the amplification effectively eliminated false-negative results and ensured the accuracy of the duplex-rtRAA system. We first developed and evaluated a universal singleplex-rtRAA assay for RSV. The sensitivity of this assay for RSV was determined as 4.4 copies per reaction, and the specificity was 100%. Next, a duplex-rtRAA assay with an internal control was established. The sensitivity of the duplex-rtRAA assay approached 5.0 copies per reaction, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The two detection methods (singleplex-rtRAA and duplex-rtRAA) developed in this study were used to test 278 clinical specimens, and the results showed absolute consistency with RSV RT-qPCR analysis, demonstrating 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exerted unique physical and emotional demands on healthcare workers, however little is known about the emotional wellbeing of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in resource-restricted settings. This study investigated the prevalence of psychological distress, and sleep problems in healthcare workers in a COVID-19 referral hospital in Nigeria. METHODS: A total of 303 healthcare workers were interviewed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to evaluate psychological distress, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess multidimensional aspects of sleep, including quality, latency, duration, habitual efficiency, disturbances, use of sleeping medications and daytime dysfunction. RESULTS: The participants were mostly males, 183(60.4%) and mean age was 38.8(SD = 8.9) years. Most of the participants were married (70.3%), had spent less than 10 years in service (72.9%), and had no medical comorbidity (92.1%). The prevalence of psychological distress was 23.4%, and six in every ten participants reported sleep problems. The largest proportion of participants reported difficulty in sleep latency (81.5%), duration (71.3%), and daytime dysfunction (69.6%), while approximately one third (32%) each reported using sleep medication, and had difficulty with sleep quality. Psychological distress was inter-related with poor sleep problems (p = 0.001; effect size = 0.2). CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of psychological distress and sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic were several folds the rates previously reported in similar contexts. Preventative psychosocial support services for healthcare workers are indicated.

It might contribute to the fast spread of COVID-19. However, there are few scientific reports about quantitative comparison of COVID-19 exposure dose (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) for the susceptible individual when the viruses were released from the larynx or lungs. In this paper, a typical numerical model was built based on a breathing human model with real respiratory tract. By using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, two kinds of virus released sites in the infected individual's respiratory tract (larynx, lungs), seven kinds of particle sizes between 1 and 50 m, three kinds of expiratory flow rates: calm (10 L/min), moderate (30 L/min) and intense (90 L/min) were used to compare the particle deposition proportion and escape proportion. The inhalation dose and the adhesion dose of the susceptible individual were quantified. The results showed that COVID-19 virus-containing droplets and aerosols might be released into the environment at higher proportions (39.1%C44.2%) than viruses that replicate in lungs only (15.3%C37.1%). The exposure doses (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) of the susceptible individual in different situations were discussed. The susceptible individual suffered a higher exposure dose when the viruses were released from the larynx rather than lungs (the difference for 1 m particles was 1.2C2.2 times).

We reported a case of COVID-19 patient with acute monophasic Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS), and a literature review on the SARS-CoV-2 and GBS etiological correlation. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68 years-old man presented to the emergency department with symptoms of acute progressive symmetric ascending flaccid tetraparesis. Oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. Neurological examination showed bifacial nerve palsy and distal muscular weakness of lower limbs. The cerebrospinal fluid assessment showed an albuminocytologic dissociation. Electrophysiological studies showed delayed distal latencies and absent F waves in early course. A diagnosis of Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) subtype of GBS was then made. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are still under study. The case we described of GBS in COVID-19 patient adds to those already reported in the literature, in support of SARS-CoV-2 triggers GBS. COVID-19 associated neurological clinic should probably be seen not as a corollary of classic respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, but as SARS-CoV-2-related standalone clinical entities.

TCoV has been associated with poult enteritis complex, a syndrome that severely affects turkey production. No medical prophylaxis exists to control TCoV, therefore sanitary measures such as cleaning and disinfection are essential. It is thus important to evaluate temperatures that allow persistence of TCoV in the environment. Two series of aliquots of a suspension of a French isolate of TCoV (Fr TCoV) were stored at room temperature or +4C for 0 to 40 days. As TCoV does not grow in cell culture, the presence of residual infectious TCoV in the stored samples was tested by inoculating embryonated specific pathogen free turkey eggs. As TCoV does not induce lesions in the embryo, virus replication in the jejunum and ileum of the embryos was detected 4 days post inoculation, using RNA extraction and a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction based on the nucleocapsid gene. No surviving virus was detected after 10 days storage at +21.61.4C or after 40 days storage at +4.11.6C, these temperatures being representative of the mean summer and winter temperatures, respectively, in the major French poultry-producing region. The relatively short survival of the virus at room temperature should contribute to limited virus survival during summer months. However, infectious virus was still detected after 20 days storage at the cooler temperatures, a finding that suggests prolonged survival of Fr TCoV and easier transmission between poultry farms in a cool environment are possible.","output":"An experimental study of the survival of turkey coronavirus at room temperature and +4C"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying molecular targets for eliciting broadly virus-neutralizing antibodies is one of the key steps toward development of vaccines against emerging viral pathogens. Owing to genomic and somatic diversities among viral species, identifying protein targets for broad-spectrum virus neutralization is highly challenging even for the same virus, such as HIV-1. However, viruses rely on host glycosylation machineries to synthesize and express glycans and, thereby, may display common carbohydrate moieties. Thus, exploring glycan-binding profiles of broad-spectrum virus-neutralizing agents may provide key information to uncover the carbohydrate-based virus-neutralizing epitopes. In this study, we characterized two broadly HIV-neutralizing agents, human monoclonal antibody 2G12 and Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNA), for their viral targeting activities. Although these agents were known to be specific for oligomannosyl antigens, they differ strikingly in virus-binding activities. The former is HIV-1 specific; the latter is broadly reactive and is able to neutralize viruses of distinct phylogenetic origins, such as HIV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In carbohydrate microarray analyses, we explored the molecular basis underlying the striking differences in the spectrum of anti-virus activities of the two probes. Unlike 2G12, which is strictly specific for the high-density Man(9)GlcNAc(2)Asn (Man9)-clusters, GNA recognizes a number of N-glycan cryptic sugar moieties. These include not only the known oligomannosyl antigens but also previously unrecognized tri-antennary or multi-valent GlcNAc-terminating N-glycan epitopes (Tri/m-Gn). These findings highlight the potential of N-glycan cryptic sugar moieties as conserved targets for broad-spectrum virus neutralization and suggest the GNA-model of glycan-binding warrants focused investigation.","output":"Targeting N-Glycan Cryptic Sugar Moieties for Broad-Spectrum Virus Neutralization: Progress in Identifying Conserved Molecular Targets in Viruses of Distinct Phylogenetic Origins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this study is to investigate the probable intermediate hosts and the allergenicity of the notorious virus SARS-CoV-2 to understand how this virus emerged.

Refined alignment of the spike protein in NCBI found several fragments that are specific to SARS-CoV-2 and/or SARS-CoV are specific to Rattus norvegicus and/or Mus musculus, suggesting that rodents are the intermediate reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To evaluate the allergenicity values, the binding affinities of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I or II molecules with the spike proteins were calculated, and the results showed that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are predicted to bind to fourteen HLA class I and II molecules with super-high HLA allele-peptide affinities. The infection rate of individuals who have HLA alleles with very high binding affinities who might become infected and develop into refractory patients if there were no medical or non-medical interventions is about 7.36% and 4.78% of Chinese and Americans, respectively. Extremely high temperature and exceptionally low precipitation, the common climate factors between the outbreak sites of COVID-19 in Wuhan in 2019 and SARS in Guangdong in 2002, might have promoted coronavirus evolution into more virulent forms.

Currently, there is limited research on the effect of sound environment on spatial knowledge acquisition in virtual outpatient polyclinics. In this study, a virtual simulated outpatient polyclinic has been created with varying levels of visual and audio cues. Eighty participants were assigned to one of the four groups: a control (no visual signage), a visual (visual signage), an only audio (no landmarks and no visual signage), and an audio-visual group. The virtual environment was presented as a video walkthrough with passive exploration to test spatial knowledge acquisition with tasks based on the landmark-route-survey model. The results showed that a combination of visual signage and sound environment resulted in higher spatial knowledge acquisition. No significant difference was found between the performance of the visual group and the control group that shows that signage alone cannot aid spatial knowledge in virtual outpatient polyclinics.

We coded webpages for typology and portrayal of immune boosting and supplements. We recorded mentions of microbiome, whether the webpage was selling or advertising an immune boosting product or service, and suggested strategies for boosting immunity. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between webpages that appeared in the searches in Canada and the USA. The most common types of webpages were from news (40.5%) and commercial (24.7%) websites. The concept of immune boosting was portrayed as beneficial for avoiding COVID-19 in 85.5% of webpages and supplements were portrayed as beneficial in 40% of the webpages, but commercial sites were more likely to have these portrayals.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients having urgent or cancer surgery at a NHS Trust from 1st March to 30th April 2020 who had been prioritised by a multi-disciplinary COVID Surgery group. Rates of post-operative PCR positive and suspected COVID-19 infections within 30 days, 30-day mortality and any death related to COVID-19 are reported. RESULTS: Overall 597 patients underwent surgery with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range (IQR) 54C74 years). Of these, 86.1% (514/597) had a current cancer diagnosis. During the period, 60.8% (363/597) of patients had surgery at the NHS Trust whilst 39.2% (234/597) had surgery at Independent Sector hospitals. The incidence of COVID-19 in the East Midlands was 193.7 per 100,000 population during the study period. In the 30 days following surgery, 1.3% (8/597) of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with all cases at the NHS site. Overall 30-day mortality was 0.7% (4/597). Following a PCR positive COVID-19 diagnosis, mortality was 25.0% (2/8).

Meanwhile, recent studies provide compelling evidence on how contact distancing, the use of face masks, and handwashing habits can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In this context, we investigated the effect that these personal protection habits can have in preventing new waves of contagion. METHODS: We extended an agent-based COVID-19 epidemic model in a simulated community to incorporate the mechanisms of these aforementioned personal care habits and measure their incidence in person-to-person transmission. A full factorial experiment design was performed to illustrate the extent to which the interplay between these personal habits is effective in mitigating the spread of disease. A global sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters that control these habits to further validate the results. RESULTS: We found that observing physical distance is the dominant habit in reducing disease transmission, although adopting either or both of the other two habits is necessary to some extent to suppress a new outbreak entirely. When physical distance is not observed, adherence to the use of masks or handwashing has a significant decrease in infections and mortality, but the epidemic still unfolds. We also found that in all scenarios, the combined effect of adhering to the three habits is more powerful than adopting them separately. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a broad adherence of the population to voluntary self-care habits would help contain unfold of new outbreaks. The purpose of our model is illustrative and contributes to ratify the importance of urging citizens to adopt the amalgam of personal care habits as a primary collective protection measure to prevent communities from returning to confinements, while immunisation is carried out in late stages of the pandemic.","output":"Impact of Personal Protection Habits on the Spread of Pandemics: Insights from an Agent-Based Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Preventive strategies are known to reduce cancer risk and incidence and improve prognosis. Men seldom seek medical information about cancer prevention and risk reduction. The aim of this meta-narrative systematic review was to critically appraise evidence from qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies that explored men's information-seeking behaviors in relation to cancer prevention and risk reduction. METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Education Full Text, and ERIC were systematically searched for studies published in English between January 1, 2006 and May 30, 2016. A total of 4117 titles were identified; of which, 31 studies were included (21 qualitative studies, 9 quantitative studies, and 1 mixed-methods study). The methodological quality of the studies was appraised by using different tools. RESULTS Most studies focused on screening for prostate (n = 18) and colorectal cancer (n = 7). Most men were passive information-gatherers rather than active information-seekers. Key sources of information included the Internet for active information-seekers and health care professionals for passive information-gatherers. Barriers to information-seeking included information overload, embarrassment, and fear. Low literacy and health literacy levels were addressed in 3 studies and were identified as impediments to active information-seeking. Facilitators to information-seeking included family support, media, celebrity endorsements, and targeted information. CONCLUSIONS Men's information-seeking behavior regarding cancer risk reduction, prevention, and screening is influenced by several factors. This necessitates targeted interventions aimed at raising awareness of cancer prevention and screening, while accounting for men's informational needs, preferred learning strategies, and literacy levels.","output":"Men's information-seeking behavior regarding cancer risk and screening: A meta-narrative systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To characterize enzymatic activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) and its four site-directed mutants.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey data measuring leader support, staff influence over decision making, staff work pressure and objective outcome data measuring patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Multilevel serial mediation analysis showed a significantly positive association between leader support and staff influence over decisions (B=0.74, SE=0.07, p<0.01). Furthermore, staff influence over decisions showed a negative association with staff work pressure (B=?0.84, SE=0.41, p<0.05) which in turn was negatively linked to patient satisfaction (B=?17.50, SE=4.34, p<0.01).

Therefore, we investigated the association between sex and ICU survival, adjusting for these and other variables. In this multicenter observational cohort study, all patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to seven ICUs in one region across Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany, and requiring vital organ support during the first pandemic wave were included. With a random intercept for a center, mixed-effects logistic regression was used to investigate the association between sex and ICU survival.

Interaction terms were added to investigate effect modifications by sex with country and sex with obesity. A total of 551 patients (29% were females) were included. Mean age was 65.4  11.2 years. Females were more often obese and smoked less frequently than males (p-value 0.001 and 0.042, respectively). APACHE II scores of females and males were comparable.

Nigeria-linked seizures involved 190,407 kg of pangolin derivatives (99.9% scales) from a minimum of 799,343 pangolins (95% confidence interval; 625,944-996,353) of four species (see caveats in Methods). All shipments confiscated in transit were destined for Asia, with a rapid increase in the mass of maritime shipments over time. Furthermore, stockpiling of pangolin derivatives for overseas shipment is perhaps a prominent trafficking model in Nigeria. Nigeria's law enforcement efforts improved from 2017, the same year Nigeria apparently began playing a hub role. The impact of pangolin's CITES Appendix I listing on pangolin trafficking was unclear, as the marked rise in seizures from 2017 when the listing became effective, coincided with improvements in Nigerian law enforcement efforts.

Although the introduction of efficacious vaccines has led to overall declines in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there has been a recent increase in infections once more due to the appearance of mutant strains with higher virulence. It therefore remains vital to identify predictors of poor outcomes in this patient population. PURPOSE: The objective of our study was to identify predictors of prolonged hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, and death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 at our health system that includes one tertiary care center and two community hospitals located in the Chicago metropolitan area. The main outcome was a composite endpoint of hospitalization >28 days, ICU admission, intubation, and death. Explanatory variables associated with the primary outcome in the bivariate analysis (p<0.05) were included in the multivariable logistic regression model. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 25.0. RESULTS: Between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020, 1029 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 were included in our analysis. Of these patients, 379 met the composite endpoint. Baseline demographics are described in Table 1. Of note, our cohort consisted of a predominantly minority patient population including 47% Hispanic, 17% African American, 16% Caucasian, and 16% other. In bivariate analysis, age, hypertension, tobacco and alcohol abuse, obesity, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, documented thrombosis, troponin, CRP, ESR, ferritin, LDH, BNP, D-dimer >5x the upper limit of normal, lactate, and right ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral <9.5 were significant. After multivariable adjustment, explanatory variables associated with the composite endpoint included troponin (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.08C5.17, p 0.03), D-dimer (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.23C1.98, p<0.01, lactate (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.28C1.95, p<0.01), and documented thrombosis (OR 3.56; 95% CI 1.30C8.70, p<.05).

CONCLUSIONS: In a large urban cohort with a predominantly minority population, we identified several clinical predictors of poor outcomes. Of note, race was not a predictor of the primary endpoint in this study. While recent literature has demonstrated worse outcomes among racial minorities infected with SARS-CoV-2, our data suggests these variations are related to social determinants of health rather than biologic causes.

Pinpointing the roles of Flaviviridae proteins in virion production could reveal new avenues for antiviral therapeutics.","output":"Architects of assembly: roles of Flaviviridae non-structural proteins in virion morphogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death among men and women worldwide. The disease initially has a silent phenotype, which leads to the progression of the disease and ultimately the lack of proper response to routine treatments. Autophagy, known as an intracellular \\"recycle bin\\" for the degradation of defective proteins and molecules, is one of the mechanisms that has been considered in the context of cancer in recent years. OBJECTIVE This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of published articles on autophagy in the context of lung cancer to have a complete view of the role of autophagy in lung cancer and its possible treatments. METHODS PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched until June 15 to find related articles. No specific search filters or restrictions were applied. The results were entered into reference management software for aggregation and management. The full text of all articles was screened and studied. FINDINGS Studies on the exact function of autophagy in lung cancer are contradictory, but what can be concluded from a review of literature on lung cancer is that targeting autophagy combined with traditional routine therapies such as chemotherapy, especially in advanced stages of lung cancer, can be an effective anti-cancer approach.

To secure the full benefits of mass vaccination, which started in early January 2021, it is of utmost importance to complement it with mid-term non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The objective was to minimize human losses and to limit social and economic costs. In this paper a two-phase stochastic dynamic network compartmental model (a pre-vaccination SEIR until 15 February 2021 and a post-vaccination SVEIR from 15 February 2021 to 30 June 2021) is developed. Three scenarios are assessed for the first phase: (a) A baseline scenario, which lifts the national lockdown and all NPIs in January 2021; (b) a \\"semi-lockdown\\" scenario with school opening, partial retail sector operation, universal mask wearing, and social distancing/teleworking in January 2021; and (c) a \\"rolling lockdown\\" scenario combining a partial lifting of measures in January 2021 followed by a third nationwide lockdown in February 2021. In the second phase three scenarios with different vaccination rates are assessed. Publicly available data along with some first results of the SHARE COVID-19 survey conducted in Greece are used as input. The results regarding the first phase indicate that the \\"semi-lockdown\\" scenario clearly outperforms the third lockdown scenario (5.7% less expected fatalities); the second phase is extremely sensitive on the availability of sufficient vaccine supplies and high vaccination rates.","output":"A Two-Phase Stochastic Dynamic Model for COVID-19 Mid-Term Policy Recommendations in Greece: A Pathway towards Mass Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are responsible for removing ubiquitin (Ub) from its protein conjugates. DUBs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. Commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the C-terminal Ub motif or contain Ub coupled to a fluorophore (Z-LRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBsMERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.","output":"Engineered unnatural ubiquitin for optimal detection of deubiquitinating enzymes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Symptom recognition is necessary to identify people with possible Covid-19. Clinical case definitions vary in type and number of symptoms included. No large studies have investigated how these perform for hospitalized patients of different ages and sex. METHODS: We used international prospective observational data from patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19. We investigated how symptoms varied by age and sex. We performed logistic regression to assess the relationship of age and sex with the most prevalent symptoms in our dataset and with published case definitions, allowing for clustering by country as a random intercept. RESULTS: 60 161 patients from 43 countries were included, with median age 70 years (interquartile range 55C82). Fever (68%), cough (68%) and shortness of breath (63%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Their prevalence was greater among patients aged 30C60 years (respectively 79%, 78%, 66%), and lower in children (18 years: 68%, 47%, 22%) and older adults (70 years: 61%, 62%, 61%). The most sensitive case definition assessed was one or more of cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle pains or sore throat, met by 92% of the whole cohort. Confusion was the most prevalent symptom for patients whose symptoms did not meet any of the assessed case definitions. Regression models showed significant differences in symptoms with age, and considerable heterogeneity between countries. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults and children admitted to hospital with Covid-19 are less likely to present with typical symptoms of cough, fever and shortness of breath.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We identified the proportion of normal, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety before and during the social distancing restrictions in adults from southern Brazil. An online, self-administered questionnaire was delivered for residents within the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were examined by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Most of the participants (n = 2314) aged between 31 and 59 years (54.2%), were women (76.6%), White (90.6%) with a university degree (66.6%). Moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were reported in 3.9% and 4.5% of participants, respectively, before COVID-19. During the pandemic (JuneCJuly, 2020), these proportions increased to 29.1% (6.6-fold increase) and 37.8% (7.4-fold increase), respectively. Higher rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms were observed among women, those aged 18C30 years, diagnosed with chronic disease and participants who had their income negatively affected by social restrictions. Remaining active or becoming physically active during social distancing restrictions reduced the probability of aggravated mental health disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive and anxiety symptoms had a 6.6- and 7.4-fold increase since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Neutrophil dysfunction is a characteristic feature of the acquired immunodeficiency during kidney disease. We speculated that the impaired renal clearance of the intrinsic purine metabolite soluble uric acid (sUA) may account for neutrophil dysfunction. Indeed, hyperuricemia (HU, serum UA of 9-12 mg/dL) related or unrelated to kidney dysfunction significantly diminished neutrophil adhesion and extravasation in mice with crystal- and coronavirus-related sterile inflammation using intravital microscopy and an air pouch model. This impaired neutrophil recruitment was partially reversible by depleting UA with rasburicase. We validated these findings in vitro using either neutrophils or serum from patients with kidney dysfunction-related HU with or without UA depletion, which partially normalized the defective migration of neutrophils. Mechanistically, sUA impaired 2 integrin activity and internalization/recycling by regulating intracellular pH and cytoskeletal dynamics, physiological processes that are known to alter the migratory and phagocytic capability of neutrophils. This effect was fully reversible by blocking intracellular uptake of sUA via urate transporters. In contrast, sUA had no effect on neutrophil extracellular trap formation in neutrophils from healthy subjects or patients with kidney dysfunction. Our results identify an unexpected immunoregulatory role of the intrinsic purine metabolite sUA, which contrasts the well-known immunostimulatory effects of crystalline UA. Specifically targeting UA may help to overcome certain forms of immunodeficiency, for example in kidney dysfunction, but may enhance sterile forms of inflammation.","output":"Soluble uric acid inhibits 2 integrin-mediated neutrophil recruitment in innate immunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper deals with an analysis and evaluation of an innovative visual design of the Czech Financial Administration application, which was launched in order to solve needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis, stage and initial treatment of breast cancer. METHODS: Women included in the Netherlands Cancer Registry and diagnosed during four periods in weeks 2-17 of 2020 were compared with reference data from 2018/2019 (averaged). Weekly incidence was calculated by age group and tumor stage. The number of women receiving initial treatment within 3 months of diagnosis was calculated by period, initial treatment, age, and stage. Initial treatment, stratified by tumor behavior (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or invasive), was analyzed by logistic regression and adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, stage, subtype, and region. Factors influencing time to treatment were analyzed by Cox regression. RESULTS: Incidence declined across all age groups and tumor stages (except stage IV) from 2018/2019 to 2020, particularly for DCIS and stage I disease (p < 0.05). DCIS was less likely to be treated within 3 months (odds ratio [OR]wks2-8: 2.04, ORwks9-11: 2.18). Invasive tumors were less likely to be treated initially by mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (ORwks12-13: 0.52) or by breast conserving surgery (ORwks14-17: 0.75). Chemotherapy was less likely for tumors diagnosed in the beginning of the study period (ORwks9-11: 0.59, ORwks12-13: 0.66), but more likely for those diagnosed at the end (ORwks14-17: 1.31). Primary hormonal treatment was more common (ORwks2-8: 1.23, ORwks9-11: 1.92, ORwks12-13: 3.01). Only women diagnosed in weeks 2-8 of 2020 experienced treatment delays.

However, the impact of pandemic on the care of patients in the ERAS pathway is unknown. Certain ERAS elements (i.e. Laparoscopic surgery) were considered un-safe at the outset of the current pandemic and therefore avoided. We present our experience of implementation of Modified ERAS (M-ERAS) pathway in a small cohort of colorectal cancer resections performed in our hospital during the first peak of the pandemic. METHODS: We analysed all colorectal cancer resections performed from 11(th) March to 31(st) June 2020 in our hospital. Those who admitted via emergency pathway and managed outside M-ERAS were excluded from the analysis. Primary outcome measures were LOS, pulmonary complications and 30-day mortality rate. Secondary outcome measures were short term complications (including post-op SARS-CoV-2 infections) and 30-day re-admission rate. RESULTS: All resections were performed in a non-COVID light setting (i.e. acute hospital). We performed 8 elective resections during the pandemic and 1 of them managed outside M-ERAS. All resections were performed via open access. All tumours were locally advanced (T3 and above) and one patient had neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients had metastatic disease.

Many of the symptoms characterized as the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) could have multiple causes or are similarly seen in non-COVID patients. Accurate identification of PASC phenotypes will be important to guide future research and help the healthcare system focus its efforts and resources on adequately controlled age- and gender-specific sequelae of a COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this retrospective electronic health record (EHR) cohort study, we applied a computational framework for knowledge discovery from clinical data, MLHO, to identify phenotypes that positively associate with a past positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19. We evaluated the post-test phenotypes in two temporal windows at 3C6 and 6C9 months after the test and by age and gender. Data from longitudinal diagnosis records stored in EHRs from Mass General Brigham in the Boston Metropolitan Area was used for the analyses. Statistical analyses were performed on data from March 2020 to June 2021. Study participants included over 96 thousand patients who had tested positive or negative for COVID-19 and were not hospitalized. RESULTS: We identified 33 phenotypes among different age/gender cohorts or time windows that were positively associated with past SARS-CoV-2 infection. All identified phenotypes were newly recorded in patients medical records 2 months or longer after a COVID-19 RT-PCR test in non-hospitalized patients regardless of the test result. Among these phenotypes, a new diagnosis record for anosmia and dysgeusia (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.94C3.46]), alopecia (OR 3.09, 95% CI [2.53C3.76]), chest pain (OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.09C1.48]), chronic fatigue syndrome (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.22C2.10]), shortness of breath (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22C1.64]), pneumonia (OR 1.66, 95% CI [1.28C2.16]), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22C1.64]) is one of the most significant indicators of a past COVID-19 infection. Additionally, more new phenotypes were found with increased confidence among the cohorts who were younger than 65. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirm many of the post-COVID-19 symptoms and suggest that a variety of new diagnoses, including new diabetes mellitus and neurological disorder diagnoses, are more common among those with a history of COVID-19 than those without the infection.

In the current study, we demonstrated the interplay between PACT and IAV polymerase. Induction of IFN- by the IAV RNP complex was most robust when both RIG-I and PACT were expressed.

Neutralization capacity against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain and variants (D614G mutant, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351) was evaluated using a pseudovirus expressing the corresponding spike (S) protein. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) was also evaluated. RESULTS: All SARS-CoV-2 isolates were potently neutralized by hIG as shown by all four methodologies. Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants were effectively neutralized using the pseudovirus. hIG induced ADCC and ADCP against SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins but not E protein. Very low concentrations (25-100 g IgG/mL) were required. A potent effect was triggered by antibodies in hIG solutions against the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins.

We sought to assess the specific impact of COVID-19 on HO fellowship programs' clinical, educational, and research activities, evaluate perceptions regarding PD and trainee emotional and mental health, and identify ways to support programs. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, parametric and nonparametric tests, and multivariable logistic regression models. Responses to open-ended questions were analyzed with thematic analysis. RESULTS Significant changes to fellowship activities included transitioning fellow training from outpatient clinics to telehealth (77.7%), shifting to virtual education (94.2%), and moving to remote research work (63.1%). A minority (21.4%) of PDs reported that their fellows were redeployed to cover non-HO services. Most PDs (54.4%) believed COVID-19 had a slight negative impact on fellowship training. PD self-reported burnout increased significantly from 15.5% prepandemic to 44.7% during the pandemic, and most PDs witnessed minor signs of fellow burnout (52.4%). Common PD concerns included inadequate supervision for telehealth activities, reduced opportunities for fellow advancement and promotion, lack of professional development activities, limited research operations and funding, program financial constraints, and virtual recruitment.

Therefore, their prompt detection is mandatory for successful patient treatment. Solid phase red cell adherence (SPRCA) assay allows for platelet antibody detection widely. However, preparation of fresh platelets with HLA-I and human platelet antigens (HPA)1-5,15 genotyped as target cells is inconvenient and fresh platelets have a short shelf life. In this study, the lyophilised human platelets for antibody detection in SPRCA were prepared. Firstly, platelets were resuspended in lyophilisation buffer and freeze-dried. Then the characteristics of lyophilised platelet were analysed. Rehydrated platelets were recovered with a mean rate of 80.91%  2.87%, and still retained spherical morphology. Indirect flow cytometry showed that glycoproteins IIb/IIIa, Ia/IIa, Ib/IX, IV, CD109, and HLA class I were present on the surface of the lyophilised platelets at a comparable level to that of fresh platelets. The consistent results obtained with WHO reference reagents containing anti-HPA-1a, anti-HPA-3a, and anti-HPA-5b, as well as clinical samples from the same donors containing anti-HLA antibodies when reacting with lyophilised versus fresh platelets confirmed good antigenicity preservation of platelets after freeze-drying. Further investigation showed that the lyophilised platelets could be stored at 2-8 C for up to 14 months and the reconstituted suspension was stable for 48 h. Therefore, lyophilised platelets can be a convenient alternative to fresh platelets to use for anti-platelet antibody detection in SPRCA tests.","output":"Application of lyophilised human platelets for antibody detection in solid phase red cell adherence assay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cutaneous wound healing is associated with the unpleasant sensation of itching.

IL-31 was released by dermal conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2s) recruited to wounds and increased itch sensory neuron sensitivity. Transfer of cDC2s isolated from late-stage wounds into healthy skin was sufficient to induce itching in a manner dependent on IL-31 expression. Addition of the cytokine TGF-?1, which promotes wound healing, to dermal DCs in vitro was sufficient to induce Il31 expression, and Tgfbr1f/f CD11c-Cre mice exhibited reduced scratching and decreased Il31 expression in wounds in vivo. Thus, cDC2s promote itching during skin would healing via a TGF-?-IL-31 axis with implications for treatment of wound itching.","output":"The Cytokine TGF-?

Observations: Despite the challenges experienced during the pandemic, the global oncology community has responded with an unprecedented level of investigation, collaboration, and technological innovation through the rapid development of COVID-19 registries that have allowed an increased understanding of the natural history, risk factors, and outcomes of patients with cancer who are diagnosed with COVID-19. This review describes 14 major registries comprising more than 28 500 patients with cancer and COVID-19; these ongoing registry efforts have provided an improved understanding of the impact and outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: An initiative is needed to promote active collaboration between different registries to improve the quality and consistency of information.

Accordingly, it is a vital process to detect positive cases at an early stage for treatment and controlling the disease from spreading. Several medical tests had been applied for COVID-19 detection in certain injuries, but with limited efficiency. In this study, a new COVID-19 diagnosis strategy called Feature Correlated Na?ve Bayes (FCNB) has been introduced. The FCNB consists of four phases, which are; Feature Selection Phase (FSP), Feature Clustering Phase (FCP), Master Feature Weighting Phase (MFWP), and Feature Correlated Na?ve Bayes Phase (FCNBP). The FSP selects only the most effective features among the extracted features from laboratory tests for both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 people by using the Genetic Algorithm as a wrapper method. The FCP constructs many clusters of features based on the selected features from FSP by using a novel clustering technique. These clusters of features are called Master Features (MFs) in which each MF contains a set of dependent features. The MFWP assigns a weight value to each MF by using a new weight calculation method. The FCNBP is used to classify patients based on the weighted Na?ve Bayes algorithm with many modifications as the correlation between features. The proposed FCNB strategy has been compared to recent competitive techniques. Experimental results have proven the effectiveness of the FCNB strategy in which it outperforms recent competitive techniques because it achieves the maximum (99%) detection accuracy.","output":"Accurate detection of Covid-19 patients based on Feature Correlated Na?ve Bayes (FCNB) classification strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the factors influencing the delay in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA negative conversion. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted that included patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the Tunisian national containment center. Follow-up consisted of a weekly RT-PCR test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors associated with negative RNA conversion. RESULTS: Among the 264 patients included, the median duration of viral clearance was 20 days (interquartile range (IQR) 17-32 days). The shortest duration was 9 days and the longest was 58 days. Factors associated with negative conversion of viral RNA were symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and shortness of breath (hazard ratio (HR) 0.600, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.401-0.897) and face mask use when exposed to COVID-19 cases (HR 2.006, 95% CI 1.247-3.228).

This was contrasted to a control group of influenza positive patients admitted during 2019/20 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology, and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27/836(3.2%) had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days post-admission) rising to 51/836(6.1%) throughout admission. Blood cultures, respiratory samples, pneumococcal or legionella urinary antigens, and respiratory viral PCR panels were obtained from 643(77%), 112(13%), 249(30%), 246(29%) and 250(30%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. A positive blood culture was identified in 60(7.1%) patients, of which 39/60 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia secondary to respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (1 community-acquired K. pneumoniae and 1 ventilator-associated E. cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (3 candida, 2 Enterococcus spp. and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community acquired bacteraemias(16) were attributed to non-respiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; S. aureus the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24;16.7%) with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection.

Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of in-center hemodialysis patients who underwent mRNA-1273 vaccine from March 1st to April 30th, 2021. All AEs occurring after the first and the second doses were collected and classified as local or systemic. Results Overall, 126 patients on chronic maintenance dialysis were vaccinated with two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine. Mean age was 68 (IQR, 54,7-76) years and 53.6% of patients were aged [] 65 years. During the observational period of 68 (IQR, 66-70) days, AEs occurred in 57.9% and 61.9% of patients after the first dose and second dose, respectively. The most common AEs were: injection-site pain (61.9%), erythema (4.8%), itching (4.8%), swelling (16.7%), axillary swelling/tenderness (2.4%), fever (17.5%) headache (7.9%), fatigue (23.8%), myalgia (17.5%), arthralgia (12.7%), dyspnoea (2.4%); nausea/ vomiting (7.1%), diarrhoea (5.6%), shivers (4%) and vertigo (1.6%). The rates of local AEs were similar after the first and second doses (P=0.8), whereas systemic AEs occurred more frequently after the second dose (P=0.001). Fever (P=0.03), fatigue (P=0.02) and nausea/vomiting (P=0.03) were significantly more frequent after the second dose of vaccine. There were no age-related differences in the rate of AEs. Overall, vaccine-related AEs in hemodialysis patients seem lower than in the general population. Conclusion RNA-1273 vaccine is associated with the development of transient AEs after the first (57.9%) and second dose (61.9%) in patients on chronic maintenance dialysis.

We propose a novel, distribution-free, and flexible approach to DEA for single-cell RNA-seq data. This new method, called ccdf, tests the association of each gene expression with one or many variables of interest (that can be either continuous or discrete), while potentially adjusting for additional covariates. To test such complex hypotheses, ccdf uses a conditional independence test relying on the conditional cumulative distribution function, estimated through multiple regressions. We provide the asymptotic distribution of the ccdf test statistic as well as a permutation test (when the number of observed cells is not sufficiently large). ccdf substantially expands the possibilities for scRNA-seq DEA studies: it obtains good statistical performance in various simulation scenarios considering complex experimental designs (i.e. beyond the two condition comparison), while retaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods in a two-condition benchmark. We apply ccdf to a large publicly available scRNA-seq dataset of 84,140 SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8+ T cells, in order to identify the diffentially expressed genes across 3 groups of COVID-19 severity (mild, hospitalized, and ICU) while accounting for seven different cellular subpopulations.","output":"Distribution-free complex hypothesis testing for single-cell RNA-seq differential expression analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a worldwide pandemic in late 2019 and initially was described as a primary respiratory illness The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are now known to encompass nearly all organ systems, including the central nervous system We present a case of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient who recovered from documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and later presented with symptoms of meningitis While cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not reveal any bacterial or viral etiologies, evidence of an inflammatory state, including ophthalmologic findings of episcleritis, indicate what is likely the first reported case of aseptic meningitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after initial clinical recovery","output":"Aseptic Meningitis after Recovery from SARS-CoV-2 in an Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Recipient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 epidemic broke out in China in January 2020, which triggered the largest wave of corporate philanthropic donations since the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

The results show substantial and steadily increasing numbers of citations to all 17 sites, with larger increases from 2019 to 2020. In 2020, Covid-19 citations to these websites were particularly common for news organisations, the WHO, and the UK Office for National Statistics, apparently for up-to-date information in the rapidly changing circumstances of the pandemic. Except for the UN, the most cited URLs of each organisation were not traditional report-like grey literature but were other types, such as news stories, data, statistics, and general guidance. The Covid-19 citations to most of these websites originated primarily from medical research, commonly for coronavirus data and statistics. Other fields extensively cited some of the non-health websites, as illustrated by social science (including psychology) studies often citing UNESCO. The results confirm that grey literature from major websites has become even more important within academia during the pandemic, providing up-to-date information from credible sources despite a lack of academic peer review. Researchers, reviewers, and editors should accept that it is reasonable to cite this information, when relevant, and evaluators should value academic work that supports these non-academic outputs.

These differences reflect longstanding disparities in income, housing, air quality, preexisting health status, legal protections, and access to health care. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences have made these ancient disparities plainly visible. Methodology: As scholars in Catholic research universities committed to advancing both scientific knowledge and social justice, we examined these disparities through the lenses of both epidemiology and ethics. Findings: We see these widening disparities as not only as threats to human health, societal stability, and planetary health, but also as moral wrongs - outward manifestations of unrecognized privilege and greed. They are the concrete consequences of policies that promote structural violence and institutionalize racism. Recommendations: We encourage governments to take the following three scientific and ethical justified actions to reduce disparities, prevent future pandemics, and advance the common good: (1) Invest in public health systems; (2) Reduce economic inequities by making health care affordable to all; providing education, including early education, to all children; strengthening environmental and occupational safeguards; and creating more just tax structures; and (3) Preserve our Common Home, the small blue planet on which we all live.","output":"COVID-19 and Health Disparities: Structural Evil Unmasked"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has replaced previous variants and is less susceptible to neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection(1C3).

We describe capacity-building strategies in conjunction with two National Institutes of Health-funded primary stroke prevention trials (a feasibility trial and phase III randomized controlled trial) with initial hydroxyurea treatment for children with SCA and abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities in Nigeria. We anticipated challenges to conducting clinical trials in a low-resource setting with a local team that had not previously been involved in clinical research and sought a sustainable strategy for primary stroke prevention. METHODS This is a descriptive, prospective study of challenges, solutions, and research teams in two trials that enrolled a total of 679 children with SCA. RESULTS As part of the capacity-building component of the trials, over eight years, 23 research personnel (physicians, nurses, research coordinators, a statistician, and a pharmacist) completed a one-month research governance and ethics training program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, USA. A lead research coordinator for each site completed the Society of Clinical Research Professionals certification. TCD machines were donated; radiologists and nonradiologists were trained and certified to perform TCD. A scalable E-prescription was implemented to track hydroxyurea treatment. We worked with regional government officials to support ongoing TCD-based screening and funding for hydroxyurea for children with SCA at a high risk of stroke.

During an epidemic, people tend to take self-protective measures to reduce the infection risk. However, with the diffusion of rumor, people may be difficult to make an appropriate choice. How to reduce the negative impact of rumor and to control epidemic has become a critical issue in the social network. Elaborate mathematical model is instructive to understand such complex dynamics. In this paper, we develop a two-layer network to model the interaction between the spread of epidemic and the competitive diffusions of information. The results show that knowledge diffusion can eradicate both rumor and epidemic, where the penetration intensity of knowledge into rumor plays a vital role. Specifically, the penetration intensity of knowledge significantly increases the thresholds for rumor and epidemic to break out, even when the self-protective measure is not perfectly effective. But eradicating rumor shouldn't be equated with eradicating epidemic. The epidemic can be eradicated with rumor still diffusing, and the epidemic may keep spreading with rumor being eradicated. Moreover, the communication-layer network structure greatly affects the spread of epidemic in the contact-layer network. When people have more connections in the communication-layer network, the knowledge is more likely to diffuse widely, and the rumor and epidemic can be eradicated more efficiently. When the communication-layer network is sparse, a larger penetration intensity of knowledge into rumor is required to promote the diffusion of knowledge.","output":"Modeling the competitive diffusions of rumor and knowledge and the impacts on epidemic spreading"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To represent the complex individual interactions in the dynamics of disease spread informed by data, the coupling of an epidemiological agent-based model with the ensemble Kalman filter is proposed. The statistical inference of the propagation of a disease by means of ensemble-based data assimilation systems has been studied in previous work. The models used are mostly compartmental models representing the mean field evolution through ordinary differential equations. These techniques allow to monitor the propagation of the infections from data and to estimate several parameters of epidemiological interest. However, there are many important features which are based on the individual interactions that cannot be represented in the mean field equations, such as social network and bubbles, contact tracing, isolating individuals in risk, and social network-based distancing strategies. Agent-based models can describe contact networks at an individual level, including demographic attributes such as age, neighbourhood, household, workplaces, schools, entertainment places, among others. Nevertheless, these models have several unknown parameters which are thus difficult to estimate. In this work, we propose the use of ensemble-based data assimilation techniques to calibrate an agent-based model using daily epidemiological data. This raises the challenge of having to adapt the agent populations to incorporate the information provided by the coarse-grained data. To do this, two stochastic strategies to correct the model predictions are developed. The ensemble Kalman filter with perturbed observations is used for the joint estimation of the state and some key epidemiological parameters. We conduct experiments with an agent based-model designed for COVID-19 and assess the proposed methodology on synthetic data and on COVID-19 daily reports from Ciudad Autnoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.","output":"Inference in epidemiological agent-based models using ensemble-based data assimilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The recent pandemic of CoVID-19 has emerged as a threat to global health security. There are a very few prognostic models on CoVID-19 using machine learning. Objectives: To predict mortality among confirmed CoVID-19 patients in South Korea using machine learning and deploy the best performing algorithm as an open-source online prediction tool for decision-making. Materials and methods: Mortality for confirmed CoVID-19 patients (n=3,022) between January 20, 2020 and April 07, 2020 was predicted using five machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, K nearest neighbor, random forest and gradient boosting).

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56  prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56  for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%.

The PCA response of BALB/c PBM exceeds the response to any other known stimulus. No induction occurs upon direct stimulation of monocytes by MHV-3, but in the presence of lymphocyte collaboration, the PCA response is observed first at a lymphocyte:monocyte ratio of 2:1 and reaches a maximum as the lymphocyte:monocyte ratio approaches 4:1.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a 7-day course of methylprednisolone (MP) administered with and without tocilizumab improves outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy, relative to historical controls. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: In this randomized controlled study, patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 at Rashid Hospital, Dubai, in June 2020 were randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous MP (40 mg twice daily for 7 days) with or without a single dose of intravenous tocilizumab (400 mg). While data from the control arm, consisting of patients administered usual care, were obtained through retrospective review of their electronic medical records. The patients in the three arms were matched by disease severity and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were day 45 all-cause mortality after randomization, rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), length of ICU stay, days on ventilators, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: In total, 76 patients were recruited, including 23 treated with MP, 26 with MP plus tocilizumab, and 27 historical controls. The rates of admission to the ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation were lowest in patients treated with MP alone, with the rates in this group being significantly lower than the rates in the control group (p = 0.04). Time on a ventilator was lowest in the MP group (1.09  3.68 days) and highest in the control group (7.93  14.86 days). The number of days in the ICU was significantly lower in the MP group than in the control and MP plus tocilizumab groups (p = 0.043). One patient (4.3%) in the MP group and five (18.5%) in the control arm died within 45 days. Survival was highest in patients treated with MP alone, with the addition of tocilizumab not improving survival or any of the other outcomes significantly. INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSION: In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia on oxygen support, administration of MP daily for 7 days had reduced mortality at 45 days and was associated with significantly lower ICU admission and ventilation rates compared with usual. Adding tocilizumab to MP did not improve any of the studied outcomes significantly.","output":"Intravenous methylprednisolone with or without tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen support: A prospective comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, audiobooks have become more popular in the book industry despite the common misconception that listening is less beneficial than reading a physical book.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 910 trials retrieved on August 7, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 910 registered clinical trials with at least one drug intervention were evaluated. The number of registrations (32.4%, 295) from the United States accounted for nearly one-third of the total and far exceeded that of other countries individually. Furthermore, the peak number of trials were registered in April (34.3%, 312). Over half of the trials (51.2%, 466) are in the recruitment phase, and only 4.2% (38) of the trials have been completed. The median (interquartile range) estimated enrollment is 127 (59, 365). In 39% (355) of trials, the estimated enrollment is less than 100 participants. A total of 94.5% (790) of the trials use randomization in the allocation, 82.7% (753) use a parallel intervention mode, and 52.2% (475) use masking. A total of 287 drug names have been standardized and mapped. Hydroxychloroquine is the leading drug among the registered trials (7.47%, 68). Among the main countries contributing to investigations on hydroxychloroquine, the United States ranks first with 36.76% (25) of the trials. CONCLUSION: The designs of COVID-19 clinical drug trials have greatly improved in terms of the implementation of randomization and, particularly, blinding methods. In terms of drug reuse, the number of drug types has greatly increased, and hundreds of drugs have been used for efficacy screening. The emergence of large-sample registration trials is expected to address the uncertainty regarding the current clinical efficacy of some drugs.","output":"COVID-19 Clinical Trials Registered Worldwide for Drug Intervention: An Overview and Characteristic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs) have recently been reported among patients with COVID-19, and it has been hypothesised that oral and nasal tissues may contain host cells of SARS-CoV-2 We report on two cases (spouses) with SARS-CoV-2 infection with self-reported OTDs, but otherwise no typical respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 CASE PRESENTATION: A man in his nineties (index patient) had respiratory symptoms and dysgeusia, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 His daughter-in-law and son had no respiratory COVID-19 symptoms However, they experienced complete loss of smell and taste, respectively, 7 and 10 days after their first close contact with the index patient Both tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA INTERPRETATION: Our case histories support recent reports hypothesising that anosmia and ageusia may be the only symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that SARS-CoV-2may infect oral and nasal tissues Together, these findings may inform future research, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19","output":"Loss of smell or taste as the only symptom of COVID-19/ Covid-19med nedsatt lukte- og smakssans som eneste symptom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cross-talk between ubiquitination and ADP-ribosylation regulates spatiotemporal recruitment of key players in many signaling pathways.

We argue that ideologies have clouded our scientific thinking about mental health in two ways: by considering the societal utility of individuals and their behavior a key criterion for distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy people, and by dividing what actually seem to be continuous functions relating psychological and neurocognitive underpinnings to human behavior into binary, discrete categories that are then taken to define clinical phenomena. We suggest letting both traditions go and establish a health psychology that restrains from imposing societal values onto individuals, and then taking the fit between behavior and values to conceptualize unhealthiness.

Computational elements are networked at every scale and can communicate with each other and with humans.

In this scenario, monitoring spatial and temporal properties plays a key role in the understanding of how complex behaviors can emerge from local and dynamic interactions. We revisit here the Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape Logic (STREL), a logic-based formal language designed to express and monitor spatio-temporal requirements over the execution of mobile and spatially distributed CPS. STREL considers the physical space in which CPS entities (nodes of the graph) are arranged as a weighted graph representing their dynamic topological configuration. Both nodes and edges include attributes modeling physical and logical quantities that can evolve over time. STREL combines the Signal Temporal Logic with two spatial modalities reach and escape that operate over the weighted graph. From these basic operators, we can derive other important spatial modalities such as everywhere, somewhere and surround. We propose both qualitative and quantitative semantics based on constraint semiring algebraic structure. We provide an offline monitoring algorithm for STREL and we show the feasibility of our approach with the application to two case studies: monitoring spatio-temporal requirements over a simulated mobile ad-hoc sensor network and a simulated epidemic spreading model for COVID19.","output":"A Logic for Monitoring Dynamic Networks of Spatially-distributed Cyber-Physical Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 74-year-old woman who developed schwannoma of the sigmoid colon was referred to our hospital for colonography to determine the cause of her stool occult blood.

Objective: To describe the outcomes of neonates born to mothers with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection and the IP&C practices associated with these outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort analysis reviewed the medical records for maternal and newborn data for all 101 neonates born to 100 mothers positive for or with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 13 to April 24, 2020. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using Cobas (Roche Diagnostics) or Xpert Xpress (Cepheid) assays. Newborns were admitted to well-baby nurseries (WBNs) (82 infants) and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) (19 infants) in 2 affiliate hospitals at a large academic medical center in New York, New York. Newborns from the WBNs roomed-in with their mothers, who were required to wear masks. Direct breastfeeding after appropriate hygiene was encouraged. Exposures: Perinatal exposure to maternal asymptomatic/mild vs severe/critical COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was newborn SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Maternal COVID-19 status was classified as asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic vs severe/critical. Newborn characteristics and clinical courses were compared across maternal COVID-19 severity. Results: In total, 141 tests were obtained from 101 newborns (54 girls [53.5%]) on 0 to 25 days of life (DOL-0 to DOL-25) (median, DOL-1; interquartile range [IQR], DOL-1 to DOL-3). Two newborns had indeterminate test results, indicative of low viral load (2.0%; 95% CI, 0.2%-7.0%); 1 newborn never underwent retesting but remained well on follow-up, and the other had negative results on retesting. Maternal severe/critical COVID-19 was associated with newborns born approximately 1 week earlier (median gestational age, 37.9 [IQR, 37.1-38.4] vs 39.1 [IQR, 38.3-40.2] weeks; P = .02) and at increased risk of requiring phototherapy (3 of 10 [30.0%] vs 6 of 91 [7.0%]; P = .04) compared with newborns of mothers with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19.

Public health authorities are hesitant in introducing social distancing interventions due to societal disruption and productivity losses. This study estimates the effectiveness and total cost (from a societal perspective, with a lifespan time horizon) of a comprehensive range of social distancing and antiviral drug strategies, under a range of pandemic severity categories. METHODS: An economic analysis was conducted using a simulation model of a community of ~30,000 in Australia. Data from the 2009 pandemic was used to derive relationships between the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and hospitalization rates for each of five pandemic severity categories, with CFR ranging from 0.1% to 2.5%. RESULTS: For a pandemic with basic reproduction number R(0) = 1.8, adopting no interventions resulted in total costs ranging from $441 per person for a pandemic at category 1 (CFR 0.1%) to $8,550 per person at category 5 (CFR 2.5%). For severe pandemics of category 3 (CFR 0.75%) and greater, a strategy combining antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, extended school closure and community contact reduction resulted in the lowest total cost of any strategy, costing $1,584 per person at category 5. This strategy was highly effective, reducing the attack rate to 5%. With low severity pandemics costs are dominated by productivity losses due to illness and social distancing interventions, whereas higher severity pandemic costs are dominated by healthcare costs and costs arising from productivity losses due to death.

METHODS: Retrospective chart review were performed to identify all laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia who reported to the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Saudi Arabia and WHO between April 23, 2014 and August 31, 2015. Patients charts were also reviewed for demographic information, mortality, comorbidities, clinical presentations, health care facility and presented with descriptive and comparative statistics using non parametric binomial test and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Confirmed cases of male patients (61.1%) exceeded those of female patients (38.9%). Infections among Saudi patients (62.6%) exceeded those among non-Saudi patients (37.4%; P = 0.001). The majority of the patients were aged 21C40 years (37.4%) or 41C60 years (35.8%); 43 (22.6%) were aged >61 years, and (8) 4.2% were aged 0C20 years.

Hicksii, induces apoptotic and autophagic cell death. However, whether DMGF suppresses tumor metastasis is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-metastatic activities of DMGF on the metastatic processes of melanoma cells in vivo and in vitro. A transwell assay showed that DMGF could effectively attenuate the motility of B16F10 cells, and the results of real-time PCR revealed that DMGF also suppressed the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Moreover, DMGF did not influence tube formation but inhibited the migration of endothelial cells. Furthermore, animal models were used to monitor the effects of DMGF on tumor metastasis, and all models showed that DMGF significantly suppressed the metastatic behaviors of B16F10 cells, including intravasation, colonization, and invasion of the lymphatic duct. In addition, DMGF could also reduce the densities of the blood vessels in the tumor area in vivo. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of anti-metastatic activity revealed that DMGF can down-regulate the levels of key modulators of the Cdc42/Rac1 pathway to interfere in F-actin polymerization and suppress the formation of lamellipodia by reducing the phosphorylation of CREB. These data suggested that DMGF presents anti-metastatic activities in B16F10 melanoma cells. Here, we demonstrated that DMGF can inhibit the metastasis of highly invasive melanoma cancer cells through the down-regulation of F-actin polymerization. Considering these findings, DMGF may be further developed to serve as a chemoprevention drug for patients with metastatic melanoma.","output":"The inhibitory effect of 7,7-dimethoxyagastisflavone on the metastasis of melanoma cells via the suppression of F-actin polymerization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus emerged from an animal reservoir in 2002 and has the potential to reemerge, as shown by the occurrence of non-laboratory-associated new cases in the winter of 2003.

The results demonstrate that the TM domain of the protein forms a helical structure in detergent micelles. An unstructured linker is identified between the TM helix and heptapeptide repeat 2 region. The linker is due to the proline residue at position 1213.

Wearable sensors that provide feedback on body movements and posture during exercise may enhance postural balance and motor control in people with LBP. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate whether physical exercising with postural feedback (EPF) improves postural balance, motor control, and patient-reported outcomes in people with LBP. METHODS: The study was an assessor-blinded 22 factorial trial. We planned to recruit 80 participants with nonspecific LBP who did not receive treatment for LBP. In addition, we aimed to recruit 40 patients with chronic, nonspecific LBP who were receiving exercise therapy (ET) at the University Hospital Zurich. Both ET patients and participants without treatment were randomized to receive either an additional EPF intervention or no additional intervention. This resulted in four different combinations of interventions: ET+EPF, ET, EPF, and no intervention. The participants underwent outcome assessments at inclusion (T1); 3 weeks later, at randomization (T2); after an intervention period of 3 weeks with a predefined exercise schedule for participants receiving EPF (T3); and after an additional 6 weeks, during which participants assigned to the EPF groups could exercise as much as they wished (T4). Patients receiving ET completed their regularly prescribed therapies during the study period. Balance was assessed during quiet standing on a force platform, and motor control was assessed during a lifting task and a waiters bow task. Physical activity was recorded using an activity tracker and the participants mobile phones during the study. The predefined EPF schedule consisted of nine sessions of 20 minutes of exercise with a tablet and inertial measurement unit sensors at home. Participants performed a series of trunk and hip movements and received feedback on their movements in a gamified environment displayed on the tablet. RESULTS: The first participant was recruited in May 2019. Data collection was completed in October 2020, with 3 patients and 32 eligible people without therapy who passed the eligibility check. CONCLUSIONS: Although it will not be possible to investigate differences in patients and people without other therapies, we expect this pilot study to provide insights into the potential of EPF to improve balance in people with LBP and adherence to such interventions.

However, pre-pandemic data beyond single center or small multi-center reports are lacking to reassure clinicians that cryopreservation of allogeneic grafts does not adversely impact post-HCT outcomes including hematopoietic engraftment and overall survival (OS). The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) has recently published three retrospective analyses of outcomes in recipients of cryopreserved compared to fresh grafts administered prior to the pandemic. Results have been conflicting and reasons for receipt of cryopreserved grafts were not routinely collected, rendering interpretation of the impact of cryopreservation on clinical outcomes problematic. Since the pandemic provided a unifying rationale (including mandatory cryopreservation required by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and other major registries) for the majority of patients to receive cryopreserved allografts, we sought to evaluate early post-HCT clinical outcomes in patients reported to the CIBMTR database who received a first allogeneic HCT using cryopreserved grafts from March through August 2020. Methods: Key study endpoints were hematopoietic engraftment and overall survival (OS). We compared these outcomes to those in patients allografted using fresh products transplanted between March through August 2019. Additional patient selection criteria included: 1) recipients in US only, 2) peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow (BM) grafts, 3) consented to research, and 4) availability of both CIBMTR product infusion and post-HCT day 100 (D100) follow-up form. The Pearson chi-square test was used for comparing discrete variables; the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparing continuous variables. Multivariate analysis (MVA) using a Cox proportional hazards model was performed for OS after adjusting for confounders and testing the proportional hazards assumption. Neutrophil engraftment by D28 and platelet engraftment by D100 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: This study included 959 and 2,499 recipients of cryopreserved and fresh products, respectively. Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Recipients of cryopreserved grafts were older, more likely to receive URD grafts, PBSC as the graft source and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. They received lower infused PBSC and BM cell doses. Due to differences in duration of follow-up between the cohorts, follow up for the OS analysis was censored at Days 100 and 180. MVA results are presented in Table 2. No impact of cryopreservation on OS at either D100 (HR 0.93, p=0.72) or D180 (HR 1.10, p=0.34) post HCT was detected (see also Figure 1). When we performed the MVA for OS limiting the analysis to URD recipients only, the results were unchanged. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were both delayed by 1 day in recipients of cryopreserved grafts (16 vs. 15 days and 21 vs. 20 days, respectively) but there was no difference in the risk of primary graft failure by D28 (OR 1.38, p=0.96). Some delay in D100 platelet engraftment was observed in recipients of cryopreserved grafts (OR 0.67, p<0.005). There were no interactions identified between donor or graft type for OS or engraftment. Other important clinical outcomes such as secondary graft failure, acute GVHD, and early relapse are being analyzed and will be included at the time of abstract presentation. Conclusion: The shift in clinical practice to cryopreserved products necessitated during the pandemic did not adversely impact early post HCT OS or risk of primary graft failure. We caution that follow up is short and it will be critical to follow this cohort and subsequent recipients of cryopreserved grafts for much longer periods to determine the ultimate impact of cryopreservation on outcomes. Nevertheless, this large multi-center study will be useful to inform clinical decision making both during and following the pandemic.

The pandemic-related body mass index z-score (zBMI) and obesity prevalence changes in children have not been clearly elucidated, especially in China. Methods: Based on the Health Promotion Program for Children and Adolescents in Suzhou of China, a total of 72,175 children aged 8-12 years with complete data for four consecutive years (2017-2020), were included. zBMI and obesity prevalence were calculated. Multiple mixed linear models were used to compare the yearly changes in zBMI before (2017-2019) and during (2019-2020) the pandemic. Finding: The prevalence of obesity slightly increased from 1229% to 1328% from 2017 to 2019, but substantially elevated to 1529% in 2020. The mean [95% Confidence Interval (CI)] of yearly change in zBMI before and during the pandemic were 0 039 (0037, 0042) and 0131 (0125, 0138), respectively;it yielded a statistically meaningful elevation of 0092 (95% CI: 0087, 0096).

Supracondylar fractures were the most common reason for fracture clinic attendance (17.3%, n = 19) with a proportional increase of 108.4% vs 2019 (2019 n = 20; 2020 n = 19) (p = 0.007). While upper limb injuries and falls from play apparatus, equipment, or height remained the most common indications for admission, there was a reduction in sports injuries (p < 0.001) but an increase in lacerations (p = 0.031). Fracture clinic management changed with 67% (n = 40) of follow-up appointments via telephone and 69% (n = 65) of patients requiring cast immobilization treated with a 3M Soft Cast, enabling self-removal. The safeguarding team saw a 22% reduction in referrals (2019: n = 41, 2020: n = 32). CONCLUSION: During this viral pandemic, the number of trauma cases decreased with a change in the mechanism of injury, median age of presentation, and an increase in referrals to the regional MTC. Adaptions in standard practice led to fewer MUA, and K-wire procedures being performed, more supracondylar fractures managed through clinic and an increase in the use of removable cast.

The retrained FSL model produces considerable gains in performance with only a few epochs and few images. In addition, FSL opens rapid retraining opportunities for human-in-the-loop systems, where a radiologist can relabel false inferences, and the model can be quickly retrained. We compare our retrained model performance with existing FSL approaches in medical imaging that train and evaluate models at once.","output":"Few-Shot Transfer Learning to improve Chest X-Ray pathology detection using limited triplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, COVID-19, a new emerging infectious disease (EID), was spread throughout the world, including Europe.

The aim of this research is to explore the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the representations of young university students from the University of the Basque Country and their emotional response when the crisis started. A free-association exercise was completed by 503 students from the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) (Northern Spain). To analyze the content, the Reinert method was used with the Iramuteq software for lexical analysis. The results showed that students placed COVID-19 at a distance from the self, pointing out issues related to social response and disinformation, while showing concerns for self-related issues that are linked to negative emotions, academic consequences, and potentially close victims. The students' concerns were categorized at four main levels: the communicative-informative level, health-emotional level, community-social level, and academic level. All of this has created overwhelming feelings of nervousness, along with anger and emotional fatigue. These results indicate the necessity for universities to work from a holistic standpoint, not only in terms of responding to academic needs but also from psychological, communicative, social, health, and well-being perspectives.","output":"Exploring the social and emotional representations used by students from the University of the Basque Country to face the first outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study was conducted on 1139 Muslims in Indonesia.

Given that 75 C 85% of pediatric burns occur in the home, it is likely that these measures had an impact on pediatric burn care. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of pediatric burn care at an American Burn Association-verified pediatric burn center. Methods Data was retrospectively extracted from all new burn patients aged 0-18 years during a pre-pandemic period (April 2019 C August 2019) and a pandemic period (April 2020 C August 2020). Continuous data was examined using 2 tailed t-tests (p < 0.05), while non-continuous data was examined using Pearson chi-squared tests (p < 0.05). These analyses were used to analyze burn demographics and examine changes in the delivery of acute and follow-up burn care before and during the pandemic. Results During the pre-pandemic period, 213 new burns were identified, compared to 172 new burns during the pandemic period. No clinically significant changes were observed in patient age at presentation (p = 0.54), total body surface area of burn (p = 0.85), and time to presentation following the injury (p = 0.24). Interestingly, a significant increase in friction burns (p = 0.023) was observed, which mainly consisted of treadmill burns. During the pandemic, burn operating room utilization remained high and represented approximately 25% of the hospital's total surgical capacity. In addition, there were no significant changes to inpatient and outpatient encounters (p = 0.56 and p = 1.00) between the two periods thereby highlighting the need for these essential services during the pandemic. Conclusions Burn-related service needs remained consistent across the pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts as demonstrated by the number of new burns as well as the continued provision of burn care. Overall, no clinically significant changes to patient demographics, aside from the increase in friction burns, were observed. Furthermore, the ability to provide all aspects of pediatric burn care at this tertiary pediatric hospital remained consistent across the pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts. Although this study presents data from the first five months on the pandemic, further analysis of the entire year will be carried out in order to identify additional trends.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Provision of Pediatric Burn Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To the Editor: Cavalcanti et al (Nov 19 issue)(1) stated in the originally published Supplementary Appendix of their article (a corrected version is available at NEJM org) that the use of \\"hydroxychloroquine and macrolides rapidly became part of the routine care of patients with Covid-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] in Brazil\\" during their trial, such that, as they stated in the originally published version of their article, \\"enrollment of patients with no previous use of these medications was challenging \\"(2) Preenrollment use of these medications was not an exclusion criterion until a change in their trial protocol (available at NEJM org) was made 5","output":"Hydroxychloroquine with or without Azithromycin in Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundPeople with CF were considered to be extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 and were advised on 23rd March 2020 to shield (stay at home;no outside contacts) MethodsIn July an e-mail survey was sent to 137 CF adults to determine how strictly they had shielded, how they had coped and the effect on wellbeing and mental health (GAD-7 & PHQ-9) Treatment adherence (measured with chipped nebulisers- CFHealthHub) and levels of anxiety and depression pre- and during shielding were compared in a subgroup that consented to being identified Changes were compared with the Wilcoxon rank test Results63 (46%) responded;19 replied anonymously and 44 (25 men) gave their identity Mean age (range) was 32 7 (17 5C64) years, FEV12 1 (0 57C4 86) L, BMI 22 8 (16 4C28 6) kg/m2 and 33 were on CFTR modulator treatment Fifty-nine (94%) reported adherence to shielding all the time/often Most (76%) found this difficult, reporting a negative impact on exercise, social support, independence, sleep and daily routines Most were not concerned about shielding being relaxed but 44% worried that others might not adhere to social distancing with risks of COVID-19 infection (43%) Adherence rates during COVID were available in 42 patients, with a median of 91% (interquartile range 84% to 100%) In 28 patients, pre-COVID adherence results were available, with a median difference of 0 (IQR -4 to 8) In 41 patients with complete data, there was a significant difference in the median pre-COVID versus during-COVID anxiety score (pre= 2, IQR 0 5C6 compared to during =5, IQR 1C11;p=0 002) Clinically significant (mild-severe) anxiety rose from 27% pre-COVID to 54% during COVID In 43 patients with complete data there was no difference in median pre-COVID versus during-COVID depression scores (pre= 3, IQR 1C10 compared to during= 3, IQR 2C12;p=0 09) ConclusionsThese CF patients showed high compliance with shielding, and high rates of adherence with medication, and none developed COVID-19 They coped well, with low depression scores, but negative impacts were reported on exercise, social support, and daily routines Anxiety levels significantly increased during shielding, and 7 patients requested a psychology consultation from this survey","output":"P122 The impact of COVID-19 shielding on the wellbeing, mental health and treatment adherence of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Choir singing is an activity that engages individuals all over the world with a broad demographic representation. Both qualitative and quantitative studies have examined the benefits of the activity but very few have examined the effects when someone loses access to it and stops singing. OBJECTIVES Examining the governmental and organisational responses precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked what happens when a choir singer loses all of their routines associated with regular participation in choir singing. MATERIALS AND METHODS One national choir organization in Sweden (n = 3163) and one in Norway (n = 1881) were approached with a short survey. This comprised questions relating to the issue \\"what do you as a choir singer misses the most?\\" Each participant was asked to rate the importance of a number of elements that pertain to the experience of choir singing. RESULTS The social aspect of singing emerged as having the strongest weight in terms of perceived loss that is, it was the element that the participants missed the most. Professional singers report that they miss the aesthetic experiences, flow, and all the physical aspects (physical training, voice training, and breathing training) to a greater degree as compared to reports from the amateurs. The importance of aesthetic experiences and physical components appeared to rise with increasing number of years that an individual had engaged with choir singing. CONCLUSION In the Scandinavian setting, the social aspect has a stronger weight than the other components and this seemed to be more significant in Norway compared to Sweden.","output":"Choir Singers Without Rehearsals and Concerts?

The role of antioxidants in health and disease has been extensively discussed, and many excellent reviews and books are available (1C3). Antioxidant liposomes hold great promise in the treatment of many diseases in which oxidative stress plays a prominent role. Oxidative stress is a physiological condition in which the production of damaging free radicals exceeds the in vivo capacity of antioxidant protection mechanisms to prevent pathophysiology. Free radicals are molecules with unpaired electrons, often highly reactive and damaging to biological systems. The biological membranes of subcellular organelles are a major site of free radical damage but proteins and DNA are also significant targets. Moreover, free radicals can alter cellular signal transduction pathways and stimulate the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. Oxygen radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) arise from the single electron reductions of oxygen.","output":"Therapeutic Uses of Antioxidant Liposomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe levels of insomnia, fatigue and intershift recovery, and psychological well-being (burnout, post-traumatic stress, and psychological distress), and to examine differences in these measures based on work-related characteristics among nursing staff during COVID-19 pandemic in the United States BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a major physical and psychological burden on nursing staff in the United States and worldwide A better understanding of these conditions will lead to tailored support and resources for nursing staff during and after the pandemic DESIGN: Cross-sectional study METHODS: Hospital nurses and nursing assistants (N=587) were recruited online between May-June, 2020 The survey included measures on insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index) fatigue and intershift recovery (Occupational Fatigue and Exhaustion Recovery-15), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey), post-traumatic stress (Short Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Rating Interview) and psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), and questions on work and demographics The STROBE checklist was followed for reporting RESULTS: The sample had subthreshold insomnia, moderate-to-high chronic fatigue, high acute fatigue, and low-to-moderate intershift recovery The sample experienced increased emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, increased personal accomplishment, moderate psychological distress, and high post-traumatic stress Nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients had significantly scored worse on almost all measures than their coworkers Certain factors like working hours per week and the frequency of 30-minute breaks were significant CONCLUSION: Nursing staff experienced poor sleep, fatigue, and multiple psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic Moreover, staff who were involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, worked more than 40 hours per week and skipped 30-minute breaks showed generally worse self-reported outcomes RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nursing administration is recommended to monitor for fatigue and distress on nursing units, re-visit current scheduling practices, reinforce rest breaks, and provide access to mental-health and sleep wellness resources with additional support for their frontline nursing groups","output":"Insomnia, fatigue and psychosocial well-being during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey of hospital nursing staff in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a novel enzyme with possible implications in the treatment of blood pressure disorders.

Discussion: A significant evidence-based component of environmental/public health (EBEPH) consist of decisions making based on best accessible, evidence that is peer-reviewed;using data as well as systematic information systems;community engagement in policy making;conducting sound evaluation;do a thorough program-planning frameworks;as well as disseminating what is being learned. As researchers, scientists, statisticians, journal editors, practitioners, as well as decision makers strive to improve population health, having a natural tendency toward scrutinizing the scientific literature aimed at novel research findings serving as the foundation for intervention as well as prevention programs. The main inspiration behind conducting research ought to be toward stimulating and collaborating appropriately on public/environmental health action. Hence, there is need for a Plan B of effective behavioural, environmental, social and systems interventions (BESSI) to reduce transmission.","output":"Evidence-based Environmental and Public Health Practices to Respond to the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the coronavirus epidemic, many Chinese hospitals have established buffer zones to prevent the spread and transmission of the virus. The buffer zone is a monitored and separate area where the patients who need hospitalizations after the quick treatments in the emergency department can temporarily wait for the Covid-19 test and receive some healthcare services to stabilize their conditions. Because the beds in the buffer zones are limited, the managers face the patient admission control problem for the buffer zone. This management and control problem is challenging since the patient arrivals are uncertain, and the patients conditions are different. In this paper, we build the infinite- and finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) models for this problem. We use the uniformization method to discretize the patient flow. We propose various iteration algorithms to solve the MDP models and obtain the optimal and threshold policies. Numerical experiments validate the advantages of the policies obtained by the algorithms in this paper over the current policies of hospitals. Note to PractitionersThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been causing enormous damage to peoples health, jobs, and well-being. COVID-19 has affected almost all countries globally and has changed the operation mode of the healthcare system, especially the hospitals. The hospitals are the frontlines of healthcare service and the battle with the COVID-19 pandemic. This article is motivated by our collaborations with hospitals in Shanghai, China. In China, many hospitals establish buffer zones: a monitored area where the patients who need hospitalizations after the quick treatments in the emergency department can temporarily wait for the Covid-19 test and receive some healthcare services to stabilize their conditions. Because the zones capacity is limited, the managers must make dynamic patient admission control decisions according to multiple factors, such as patients health conditions and the usage of beds in the zone. We propose two MDP models to solve this complex problem. Several iteration algorithms are designed to solve the MDP models and obtain the optimal and threshold policies. Based on hospitals real-life data, we show the methods presented in this paper can help hospital managers make more reasonable decisions. Although we focus on the hospitals buffer zone in China, the methodology and approach for this problem can be extended to other practical hospital management scenarios in the coronavirus pandemic. For example, For example, some hospitals have admission control problems for coronavirus patients due to hospital capacity limitations. The hospital has to decide if a patient is accepted as an inpatient or suggested to home quarantine. In such a case, the admission control problem can also be solved by the methodologies in the paper.

Abdominal thrusts, back blows, and chest compressions are traditional interventions. However, suction-based airway clearance devices (ACDs) have recently been marketed as an alternative. Of note, there is limited published evidence regarding their efficacy and safety. Our research has two aims: (1) to investigate what situational and patient factors are frequently identified, and which are associated with relief of the FBAO and survival in individuals with FBAOs treated with an ACD; and (2) to describe the experience of individuals who have used ACDs in response to a FBAO and identify facilitators and barriers to the use of ACDs compared to traditional interventions. Methods and analysis A prospective database will be developed using an online reporting system to capture ACD uses, independent of manufacturers, from July 1st, 2021 to December 31st, 2023. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize cases, outcomes, and adverse events. Clinically important subgroups will be stratified for analysis, including the severity of obstruction, patient demographics, and training of ACD users. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted with a subset of ACD users to describe in detail their experience using the device. Themes from these interviews will be assessed using the theoretical domains framework. Discussion This study will improve the evidence surrounding ACDs and compare it to current data for traditional techniques, with the aim of optimizing FBAO treatment. Data on ACDs are urgently needed as these devices are already being used by parents, caregivers, lay rescuers, and healthcare professionals to respond to choking emergencies. This evaluation will provide important information about their effectiveness and any safety concerns which can inform the public, resuscitation guidelines, and future research studies.","output":"A Protocol for the Prospective Evaluation of Novel Suction-Based Airway Clearance Devices in the Treatment of Foreign Body Airway Obstructions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, which has affected millions of lives. Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease. However, thereare children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to thatseen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality. Ithas become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder diseasebecause of their immature immune systems. Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they canpresent with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD.","output":"COVID-19 in children: Pathogenesis and current status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable development is not just possible with regard to the environmental and economic dimensions, and social issues are also important in achieving sustainable development.

METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery at Galaxy Care Laparoscopic Institute, Pune, India, between January 2007 and December 2010 were selected for participation. All procedures were performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments and trocars. Operative data-including operative time (from incision to port closure), blood loss, additional ports used, energy sources used, and intraoperative complications-were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-three procedures were performed during the study period. All procedures were completed via single incision only. Operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay were comparable with those associated with conventional laparoscopy. CONCLUSION It is debatable whether laparoscopic surgery via a single incision would threaten the position of the current gold standard of conventional laparoscopic procedures.

The cyclic peptide natural product A3 appears to be related to ternatin, but its complete structure is unknown and only 4 of its 11 stereocenters have been assigned. Hence, A3 could be any one of 128 possible stereoisomers. Guided by the stereochemistry of ternatin and more potent structural variants, we synthesized two A3 epimers, SR-A3 and SS-A3. We found that synthetic SR-A3 is indistinguishable from naturally derived A3 and potently inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Relative to SS-A3 and previously characterized ternatin variants, SR-A3 exhibits a dramatically enhanced duration of action. This increase in cellular residence time is conferred, stereospecifically, by a single -hydroxy group attached to N-methyl leucine. SR-A3 thus exemplifies a mechanism for enhancing the pharmacological potency of cyclic peptide natural products via side-chain hydroxylation.","output":"Total synthesis and biological characterization of SR-A3, a ternatin-related eEF1A inhibitor with enhanced cellular residence time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of total splenectomy and proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV) isolated or associated to the vascularization of the stomach.

All animals were sacrificed on the 7th postoperative day, and immediately followed by infusion of xanthene dye into the thoracic aorta. On the gastric mucous surface, the formation of stained areas and other areas lacking staining was measured by millimeter squares, planimetry and the computerized morphometry method. RESULTS: The formation of an area lacking in staining along the lesser gastric curvature was seen in all animals of groups B and C, which was significantly increased in group C, although in groups A and D such areas were not observed. CONCLUSION: These results showed that, in animals with splenectomy, the vascularization of the stomach was capable of perfusing the whole organ surface, but in animals with PGV alone or associated with splenectomy there was a notable decrease in blood supply throughout the area of the lesser gastric curvature, which suggests the ischemic impairment of this region.","output":"Morphometric study of gastric mucosa in dogs submitted to proximal gastric vagotomy, splenectomy or proximal gastric vagotomy associated with splenectomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper tests potential determinants of the development of the insurance sector.

In some cases, severe COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with kidney injury known as COVID-19-Associated Nephropathy, the exact mechanisms of which are unclear. A 25-year-old AA female presented with mild respiratory symptoms and positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was admitted to Emergency in March 2020. Her serum creatinine (sCr) was 1.4 mg/dL, albumin 2.92 g/dL;she recovered clinically and was discharged. She returned to hospital 25 days later with severe kidney failure, sCr of 28 mg/dL, potassium of 5.6 mmol/L and urine protein/creatinine (uPCR) of 10355 mg/g. She was initiated on hemodialysis. Kidney biopsy showed CG with acute tubular necrosis with direct invasion of the glomerular cells by particles resembling coronavirus. Hemodialysis was discontinued and she was discharged home on oral prednisone at 1mg/kg/day. After 5 months, she was tapered off of prednisone and her sCr improved to 2.6 mg/dL with uPCR of 3133 mg/g. Genetic testing with Renasight, a 382 renal gene panel was performed, yielding homozygosity for the APOL1 risk allele (c.[1024A>G;1152T>G] (p. [Ser342Gly;Ile384Met]) (G1 allele). High-risk APOL1 risk variants occur in 13% of AAs.These individuals have an estimated 4% lifetime risk for incurring FSGS. However, a 2nd hit' is necessary for kidney disease to develop. COVID-19 may lead to kidney injury due to tissue ischemia, cytokine storm, hypercoagulability or direct viral-mediated mechanisms. In COVID-19 related kidney biopsies, CG is often described. Although glucocorticoid sensitivity in such patients is not well-defined, our patient showed response to oral prednisone. This case adds to growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to CG. The dual effect of high-risk APOL1 variants and SARS-CoV-2 in effecting CG remains to be elucidated. Testing with a broad renal genetic panel could help define genetic variants that promote complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"311 Acute Kidney Injury and Collapsing Glomerulopathy in Patient With COVID-19 and Homozygous for APOL1 Gene Variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To help improving quality of care in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) set 20 quality indicators (QIs). There is a need to compile and summarize QI availability, feasibility, and global compliance in real-world registries. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic review of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted including all original articles reporting the use of the ESC QIs in AMI patients. Methods and reporting follow the guidelines of the PRISMA Statement and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020190541). Among the 220 screened citations, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria after full-text review. Among these 9 studies, there were 11 different cohorts. Patients were recruited from three different continents (31 countries). The number of QIs assessed ranged from 6 to 20, with 5 studies (56%) reporting data for at least 75% of the 20 QIs. There were room for improvement in terms of data availability (i.e. domain 6 measuring patient's satisfaction), feasibility (i.e. difficulties to find all data for composite QIs in domain 7), and attainment (i.e. high levels of compliance with the percentage of reperfused ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients, but low levels for a timely reperfusion). CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review has shown that it is possible to measure most QIs in existing registries, and that there is room for improvement in terms of data availability, feasibility, and levels of attainment to QIs.

Moreover, LPS-stimulated macrophages were used to explore the specific anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids on NLRP3-inflammasome in vitro. We found corticosteroids attenuated LPS-induced ALI, which manifested in reduction of the alveolar structure destruction, the infiltration of neutrophils and the inflammatory cytokines release of interleukin-1?

We assessed the reproducibility and inter-subject variability of rSO2 values and rSO2 limb-to-arm ratios (LARs) in lower extremities of healthy subjects. METHODS The rSO2 values and rSO2 LARs were calculated in eight healthy subjects without peripheral arterial disease. The rSO2 values were measured at rest at six fixed spots at each lower limb and a reference spot at each upper arm. NIRS provided the rSO2 values without involvement of any other processing technique. After measurements were completed, rSO2 LARs were calculated by dividing the rSO2 value of a lower extremity spot by the rSO2 value of the arm. Measurements were performed twice on 1 day and repeated on 4 different days. RESULTS Mean coefficients of variation of measurements of rSO2 values and rSO2 LARs at the same spot in the same subject were respectively less than 6% and 8% for every measurement spot over time.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted healthcare in the United States, including cardiovascular services. The impact of COVID-19 on IC fellow training in the United States has not been assessed. METHODS: The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) surveyed IC fellows training in both accredited and advanced non-accredited programs, as well as their program directors (PD). RESULTS: Responses were received from 135 IC fellows and 152 PD. All respondents noted reductions in procedural volumes beginning in March 2020. At that time, only 43% of IC fellows had performed >250 PCI. If restrictions were lifted by May 15, 2020 78% of IC fellows believed they would perform >250 PCI, but fell to only 70% if restrictions persisted until the end of the academic year. 49% of IC fellows felt that their procedural competency was impaired by COVID-19, while 97% of PD believed that IC fellows would be procedurally competent at the end of their training. Most IC fellows (65%) noted increased stress at work and at home, and many felt that job searches and/or existing offers were adversely affected by the pandemic.

RESULTS Patient demographics and preoperative laboratory values were comparable. SPLA was associated with shorter operative time (P=0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in length of hospitalization, postoperative pain medication use, cost, postoperative complication rates (ileus, urinary retention, deep space infection), or readmission between the 2 groups. There were no postoperative incisional hernias in the single-port group. The single-port group had more postoperative oxycodone use (P=0.0110). CONCLUSIONS Our study supports recently published metaanalyses that fail to support older studies demonstrating longer operative times, and higher hernia rates with SPLA.","output":"Single-port Laparoscopic Appendectomy: Beyond the Learning Curve: A Retrospective Comparison With Multi-port Laparoscopic Appendectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Publicly available genomics datasets have been growing drastically during the past decades. Although most of these datasets were initially generated to answer a pre-defined scientific question, their re-purposing became useful when new challenges such as COVID-19 arise. While the establishment and use of experimental models of COVID-19 are in progress, the potential hypotheses for mechanisms of onset and progression of COVID-19 can be generated by using in silico analysis of known COVID-19 conditions and SARS-CoV-2 targets. MethodsSelecting condition: COVID-19 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI). There is increasing data demonstrating mechanistic links between AKI and ARDS. Selecting targets: SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for cell entry. We hypothesized that modeling AKI and ARDS would lead to changes in kidney and lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We therefore evaluated expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as well as other novel molecular players of AKI and AKI-lung cross-talk in publicly available microarray datasets GSE6730 and GSE60088, which represented gene expression of lungs and kidneys in mouse models that resembled lung-kidney injury seen during SARS-CoV-2 infection.ResultsExpression of COVID-19 related genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was downregulated in lungs at early stages of injury. At a later stage, the expression of ACE2 decreased further, while expression of TMPRSS2 recovered. In kidneys, both genes were downregulated by AKI, but not by distant lung injury. We also identified 53 kidney genes upregulated by pneumonia and mechanical ventilation (PMV);and 254 lung genes upregulated by AKI, 9 genes of which were common to both organs. 3 of 9 genes were previously linked to kidney-lung cross-talk: Lcn2 (Fold Change (FC)Lung(L) =18.6, FCKidney(K) =6.32), Socs3 (FCL =10.5, FCK =10.4), Inhbb (FCL =6.20, FCK =6.17). This finding validates the current approach and reveals new 6 candidates, including Maff (FCL =7.21, FCK =5.98).ConclusionsUsing our in-silico approach, we identified changes in COVID-19 related genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in traditional mouse models of AKI and lung cross-talk.

This study examined the prevalence of menthol cigarette smoking after the ban, according to sociodemographic and smoking characteristics. METHODS Cross-sectional data came from a representative survey of current smokers (18+) in England (unweighted n=2681) between July 2020 and June 2021. The weighted prevalence of menthol cigarette smoking as a proportion of total cigarette smoking was calculated, log-binomial regression explored trends over time, and 2 statistics assessed the relationship between menthol smoking, sociodemographic and smoking characteristics. Sources of purchase of menthol cigarettes were explored. RESULTS Between July 2020 and June 2021, 15.7% (95% CI 14.5 to 17.1) of smokers reported smoking menthol cigarettes. The fitted non-linear trend supported no initial change followed by a possible reduction across April-June 2021 and fit the data better than linear and null (no change) models (2(2)=2519.7, p=0.06; 2(3)=2519.7, p=0.006). Menthol cigarette smoking was more common among younger groups (16-24=25.2%; 25-34=19.9%) and women (19.4%). Menthol cigarette smokers showed lower cigarette dependence compared with other smokers. Past-6-month purchases of menthol cigarettes from any illicit or cross-border source declined from 30.1% in the last 6 months of 2020 to 17.5% in the first 6 months of 2021. CONCLUSIONS A substantial minority of current smokers in England reported menthol cigarette smoking between July 2020 and June 2021, despite the ban, possibly reflecting mitigation of restrictions by a variety of licit means, such as legal menthol accessories. The reduction in menthol smoking across April-June 2021 warrants further monitoring.","output":"Profile of menthol cigarette smokers in the months following the removal of these products from the market: a cross-sectional population survey in England."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titres in previously infected or uninfected health care workers who received one or two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: NtAbs were titrated as dose-inhibiting 50% virus replication (ID50) by live virus microneutralization. We evaluated 41 health care workers recovering from mild or asymptomatic infection at first vaccination dose (T1_inf) and 21 days later (T2_inf). Sixteen uninfected health care workers were evaluated 20 days after first dose (T2_uninf) and 20 days after second vaccine dose (T3_uninf). RESULTS: At T2_inf, but not at T1_inf, there was a significant correlation between days from diagnosis (median 313, interquartile range 285-322) and NtAb levels (P = 0.011). NtAb titres increased at T2_inf with respect to T1_inf (1544 (732-2232) vs 26 (10-88), P < 0.001). Similarly, there was a significant increase in NtAb titres at T3_uninf compared with T2_uninf (183 (111-301) vs 5 (5-15), P < 0001). However, NtAb levels at T2_inf were significantly higher than those at T2_uninf and T3_uninf (P < 0.0001 for both analyses).

Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on existing data. Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemic's progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current \\"true\\" cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing. Findings: The model closely replicates the past data but also shows the true number of cases is likely far larger. We estimate about 493,000 current infected cases (90% CI: 271K-810K) as of March 20th, 2020. Our estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K). These numbers are significantly (more than one order of magnitude) higher than official statistics. The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M-2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K-97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K-172K). Implication: Our results suggest that the number of cases and deaths may be over an order of magnitude larger than official statistics in Iran. Absent extended testing capacity other countries may face a significant under-count of existing cases and thus be caught off guard about the actual toll of the epidemic.","output":"Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION PRONOUNCE compared the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed+carboplatin followed by pemetrexed (Pem+Cb) with paclitaxel+carboplatin+bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab (Pac+Cb+Bev) in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS Patients 18 years of age with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC (American Joint Committee on Cancer v7.0), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1 were randomized (1:1) to four cycles of induction Pem+Cb (pemetrexed, 500 mg/m, carboplatin, area under the curve = 6) followed by Pem maintenance or Pac+Cb+Bev (paclitaxel, 200 mg/m, carboplatin, area under the curve = 6, and bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg) followed by Bev maintenance in the absence of progressive disease or discontinuation. The primary objective was progression-free survival (PFS) without grade 4 toxicity (G4PFS). Secondary end points were PFS, overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Resource utilization was also assessed. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the patients randomized to Pem+Cb (N = 182) and Pac+Cb+Bev (N = 179) were well balanced between the arms. Median (months) G4PFS was 3.91 for Pem+Cb and 2.86 for Pac+Cb+Bev (hazard ratio = 0.85, 90% confidence interval, 0.7-1.04; p = 0.176); PFS, OS, ORR, or DCR did not differ significantly between the arms.

Methods: A total of 58 eyes of 58 patients with mild ptosis (2 mm) and levator function 8 mm who responded to 2.5% phenylephrine were enrolled in this study. Mller muscle conjunctival resection was performed between March 2016-March 2018, and the charts were reviewed retrospectively. Margin-reflex distance 1 was measured before and after five minutes following the instillation of phenylephrine. The amount of excision was 9 mm when the desired elevation was achieved. If the phenylephrine testing resulted in under-correction, 10 mm was resected, and in overcorrection, 8 mm resection was performed. Margin reflex distance and Schirmer test measurements were performed preoperatively and on the first, third and sixth months postoperatively. Results: The mean increase in margin-reflex distance 1 was statistically significant at the first, third and sixth months postoperatively when compared to preoperative values (p<0.05, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Postoperative symmetry was achieved in 54 patients (93.1%) after six months. Compared to the preoperative values, changes in Schirmer-1 test results were not statistically significant at each visit after the procedure (p>0.05, Wilcoxon signed ranks test).

The primary composite outcome was stroke, transient ischemic attack, or death; the secondary outcome was stroke. We used log-rank tests and unadjusted and covariate-adjusted Cox regression models to compare device closure versus medical therapy. RESULTS Among 2,303 patients, closure was not significantly associated with the primary composite outcome. The difference became significant after covariate adjustment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.68; p = 0.049). For the outcome of stroke, all comparisons were statistically significant, with unadjusted and adjusted HRs of 0.58 (p = 0.043) and 0.58 (p = 0.044), respectively. In analyses limited to the 2 disc occluder device trials, the effect of closure was not significant for the composite outcome, but was for the stroke outcome (unadjusted HR: 0.39; p = 0.013).

The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis may cause local citrullination of proteins, potentially triggering anti-citrullinated protein antibody production. However, it is not known if oral dysbiosis precedes the onset of clinical arthritis. This study comprehensively characterised the oral microbiome in anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positive at-risk individuals without clinical synovitis (CCP+at risk). METHODS Subgingival plaque was collected from periodontally healthy and diseased sites in 48 CCP+at risk, 26 early RA and 32 asymptomatic healthy control (HC) individuals. DNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform. Taxonomic profile and functional capability of the subgingival microbiome were compared between groups. RESULTS At periodontally healthy sites, CCP+at risk individuals had significantly lower microbial richness compared with HC and early RA groups (p=0.004 and 0.021). Microbial community alterations were found at phylum, genus and species levels. A large proportion of the community differed significantly in membership (523 species; 35.6%) and structure (575 species; 39.1%) comparing CCP+at risk and HC groups.

To date, there was limited data regarding the effect of COVID-19 infection on the trend of RT-PCR Ct value, risk factors for disease, effect on liver enzymes, etc. This study aimed to assess the frequency of COVID-19 infection in different age groups and genders. Association of cycle threshold (Ct) values with disease severity and to describe the effect of COVID-19 infection on LFT, Deritis ratio, and CRP. That can be used as indicators for COVID-19 infection diagnosis, the guidance for treatment decisions, and prognosis in infected individuals. METHODSThis was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Molecular Biology and Chemical Pathology sections of the Pathology Department, Shalamar Teaching Hospital Lahore from November 2020 to March 2021. ResultsMales 51% were more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Most of the infected individuals 36.5% were in the age group 20-40. Age and underlying comorbidities are important factors that play a significant role in COVID-19 severity. The uppermost number of the patients had symptoms of fever 78.3%, cough 50.4% and myalgias 50.1% RT-PCR low Ct value could be an important indicator related with the disease severity and mortality risk p value < 0.001 and 0.003 respectively. Bilirubin indirect, ALT, AST, and CRP were significantly associated with disease severity. Deritis ratio and CRP was found to be significantly associated with the risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONSReal-Time PCR results along with Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 may have benefit for clinicians in patient management decisions. Several risk factors e.g., age and comorbidities for developing severe disease and mortality risk have been identified. These biochemical laboratory parameters ALT, AST, Deritis ratio and CRP can be used as predictive biomarkers for progression towards severe disease and risk of mortality.","output":"Evaluation of liver function tests and C-reactive protein in COVID-19 (SARS Cov-2) positive patients diagnosed by Real-time PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The plant immune response regulator NPR1 resides in either the nucleus or in cytoplasmic puncta, depending on levels of the plant hormone salicylic acid.

Caused by a novel human coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe COVID-19 is characterized by cytokine storm syndromes due to innate immune activation. Primary immunodeficiency (PID) cases represent a special patient population whose impaired immune system might make them susceptible to severe infections, posing a higher risk to COVID-19, but this could also lead to suppressed inflammatory responses and cytokine storm. It remains an open question as to whether the impaired immune system constitutes a predisposing or protective factor for PID patients when facing SARS-CoV-2 infection. After literature review, it was found that, similar to other patient populations with different comorbidities, PID patients may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their varied immune status, however, may lead to different disease severity and outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. PID patients with deficiency in antiviral innate immune signaling [eg, Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7, or interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)] or interferon signaling (IFNAR2) may be linked to severe COVID-19.

The deregulated expression of microRNAs has been shown to aid classification of tumors and predict outcome in many tumors including breast PTs. The aim of our study is to investigate the clinical significance and prognostic value of microRNAs in PTs to identify a biomarker which has the potential for predicting prognosis and target therapy. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of microRNA20b in 123 breast PTs patients. The correlations between the expression of microRNA20b and clinicopathological parameters were investigated. The prognostic significance of microRNA20b was investigated by the Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: The expression level of microRNA20b increased with the increase in the tumor grade (p < 0.05). High expression of microRNA20b correlated with stromal overgrowth, marked stromal cellularity, high atypia of stromal cells, infiltrative tumor margin, high mitotic activity, tumor grade, local recurrence and metastasis (p < 0.05). High expression of microRNA20b correlated with the shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (log-rank test, p < 0.001).

Non-clinical sociodemographic features are important explanatory variables of COVID-19 outcomes, revealing existing disparities in large health care systems. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use nation-wide multicenter data of COVID-19 patients in Brazil to predict mortality and ventilator usage. The dataset contains hospitalized patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and had either recovered or were deceased between March 1 and June 30, 2020. A total of 113,214 patients with 50,387 deceased, were included. Both interpretable (sparse versions of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines) and state-of-the-art non-interpretable (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Random Forest) classification methods are employed. Death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with demographics, socioeconomic factors, and comorbidities. Variables highly predictive of mortality included geographic location of the hospital (OR = 2.2 for Northeast region, OR = 2.1 for North region); renal (OR = 2.0) and liver (OR = 1.7) chronic disease; immunosuppression (OR = 1.7); obesity (OR = 1.7); neurological (OR = 1.6), cardiovascular (OR = 1.5), and hematologic (OR = 1.2) disease; diabetes (OR = 1.4); chronic pneumopathy (OR = 1.4); immunosuppression (OR = 1.3); respiratory symptoms, ranging from respiratory discomfort (OR = 1.4) and dyspnea (OR = 1.3) to oxygen saturation less than 95% (OR = 1.7); hospitalization in a public hospital (OR = 1.2); and self-reported patient illiteracy (OR = 1.1). Validation accuracies (AUC) for predicting mortality and ventilation need reach 79% and 70%, respectively, when using only pre-admission variables. Models that use post-admission disease progression information reach accuracies (AUC) of 86% and 87% for predicting mortality and ventilation use, respectively.

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy affecting 8%C10% of Indias pregnant population. Assuming that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, the resulting symptoms are due to vasoconstriction, caused by disturbances in the reninCangiotensin system (RAS). Other features of preeclampsia include endothelial dysfunction due to placental ischemia, leading to imbalances in angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors which result in increased blood pressure, proteinuria, altered hepatic enzymes, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia, amongst others. The increased prevalence of preeclampsia that was seen among mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection might be due to misdiagnosis, as COVID-19 and preeclampsia have coincidental medical features. The major similarities of SARS-CoV-2-infected and preeclamptic women are a rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased serum ferritin and thrombocytopenia. Therefore, differential diagnosis might be difficult in pregnant women with COVID-19 who present with hypertension and proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, or elevated liver enzymes. The most promising markers for earlier diagnosis of preeclampsia is soluble endoglin (sEng), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), and placental growth factor (PlGF). Due to placental hypoxia, sFlt-1 will be overproduced, thus inhibiting PlGF, and this alteration will be observed in the circulation five weeks or more before the onset of symptoms. The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio may also be modified via infectious states, but unregulated levels of those mediators are related to placental insufficiency. Hence, pregnant women with COVID-19 may develop a preeclampsia-like syndrome that might be differentiated properly by angiogenic markers to avoid unnecessary interventions and induced preterm labor.","output":"COVID-19 and Preeclampsia: Overlapping Features in Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dementia is a neurological condition characterized by numerous types of central nervous system diseases, which gradually deteriorates an individual's reasoning, rational thinking, and judgment abilities. As a serious public health concern that currently affects more than 50 million older adults, dementia is one of the most significant causes of incapacity, disability, and dependency among older adults. As new cases are expected to increase exponentially in the next three decades, dementia, which is not a normal feature of healthy aging despite the fact that it generally affects older adults disproportionately, requires enormous management and care efforts due to its associated socioeconomic, psychological, and physical burdens that involve the patient, their caregivers, guardians, family members, and society at large. Presently, there is no cure for dementia; however, this condition could be prevented. This narrative review aimed to provide a broad overview of studies detailing the alternative lifestyle modification-centered preventive measures against dementia. A comprehensive search of key databases to find articles related to this topic revealed that participating in regular physical activities, healthy eating and dieting, avoiding all forms of smoking, avoiding air pollutants, halting or reducing alcohol consumption, exercising the mind and being socially dynamic, getting enough rest and establishing good sleeping habits, infection prevention, stress prevention, avoidance of injuries, preventing the effects of social isolation and lockdowns, continuing education, and depression prevention are protective measures against the development of dementia.","output":"Preventive Measures against the Development of Dementia in Old Age."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has had a huge impact on Chinas economic and social development, among which the tertiary industry has been severely impacted.

The probability of transmitting the disease may change due to the individuals' social behavior or interventions prescribed by the authorities. We utilized simulation on the contact networks to demonstrate how seesaw scenarios of lockdown can curb infection and level the pandemic without maximum pressure on the poor societies. Soft scenarios consist of closing businesses 2, 3, and 4 days in between with four levels of lockdown respected by 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the population. The findings reveal that the outbreak can be flattened under softer alternatives instead of a doomsday scenario of complete lockdown. More specifically, it is turned out that proposed soft lockdown strategies can flatten up to 120% of the pandemic course.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes data related to COVID-19 infection in obstetric cases are limited and evolving. Most importantly, studies reporting Indian data are strikingly few and of single centre. The objective of our study was thus to address these lacunae using data registered in the FOGSIs National registry on COVID-19 infection in pregnancy (FOGSI COVID registry). METHODS: We conducted an observational study using data retrieved from the FOGSI COVID registry. Fifty-three hospital departments participating in the registry populated data related to laboratory confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 obstetric patients. Data for the period of 28 April 2020 to 28 August 2020 were extracted from the registry. A subset of the data was formatted, curated, standardized and harmonized. Descriptive analysis was carried out, and results reported. RESULTS: Of the 989 cases analyzed, 956 women were pregnant and 33 women were in the postpartum period. A total of 569 women (61.71%, n = 922) were multi-gravida, and 713 women (72.98%, n = 977) belonged to the 21C30 years age group. A total of 492 cases (52.73%, n = 966) had a gestational age > 37 weeks. A total of 754 women (83.41%, n = 904) were asymptomatic, and 32 cases (3.54%, n = 904) had severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Fifty-six women (7.19%, n = 779) required critical care and ten women (1.01%, n = 989) died. A total of 771 pregnant women (97.23%, n = 793) gave birth of which 455 cases (59.01%) underwent a lower segment caesarean section (LSCS). There were 749 cases (95.17%, n = 771) of live birth that included eight cases of twin deliveries. 195 infants (28.34%, n = 688) were admitted to the NICU, and 13 infants (2.99%, n = 435) tested COVID-19 positive in the neonatal period. Twelve infants (1.54%, n = 779) died. CONCLUSION: 83.41% pregnant women were asymptomatic. COVID-19 infection in obstetric cases from India led to 59.01% LSCS procedures which are lower than many other countries. COVID-19 infection led to a higher maternal mortality and IUFD rate as compared to pregnant women that did not have COVID-19 infection in India.

Many vaccine candidates focus on the Spike protein, as it is targeted by neutralizing antibodies and plays a key role in viral entry. Here we investigate the diversity seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and compare it to the sequence on which most vaccine candidates are based. Using 18,514 sequences, we perform phylogenetic, population genetics, and structural bioinformatics analyses. We find limited diversity across SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Only 11 sites show polymorphisms in >5% of sequences; yet two mutations, including the D614G mutation in Spike, have already become consensus. Because SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted more rapidly than it evolves, the viral population is becoming more homogeneous, with a median of seven nucleotide substitutions between genomes. There is evidence of purifying selection but little evidence of diversifying selection, with substitution rates comparable across structural versus nonstructural genes. Finally, the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence for the Spike protein, which is the basis for different vaccine candidates, matches optimized vaccine inserts, being identical to an ancestral sequence and one mutation away from the consensus. While the rapid spread of the D614G mutation warrants further study, our results indicate that drift and bottleneck events can explain the minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients in a university hospital in northern Germany with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the winter season 2017C2018 and analyzed underlying conditions, complications, and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 272 cases of influenza were diagnosed: 70 influenza A (25.7%), 201 influenza B (73.9%), and 1 co-infection. Of 182 adults, 145 were hospitalized, 73 developed pneumonia, 11 developed myocardial infarction, two a transient ischemic attack, one a stroke, and one perimyocarditis. Eleven of the 145 hospitalized adult patients (7.6%) died, ten of them because of pneumonia. All of them had preexisting diseases. Pneumonia was associated with a mortality of 13.7%. Underlying cardiac insufficiency was correlated with higher mortality (7/51 with versus 4/126 patients without cardiac insufficiency; p < 0.05). Ninety cases of influenza were diagnosed in 89 children (30 A, 60 B), one child had first influenza B, then influenza A. Twenty-eight children (31%) were hospitalized, 15 children developed one or more complications (lower respiratory tract infections, meningeal irritations, febrile seizures, otitis media, myositis). No child died. Influenza vaccination status was known in 149 adult patients, pneumonia occurred more frequently in non-vaccinated individuals (43/90; 47.8%) than in vaccinated patients (18/59; 30.5%, p < 0.05).

Phylodynamic analyses were conducted in 14 subtype A1 and 31 subtype B clusters. The earliest dates of origin for subtypes A1 and B were in 1982.6 and in 1985.5, respectively. The transmission rate for the subtype A1 clusters ranged between 7.54 and 39.61 infections/100 person years (IQR: 9.39, 15.88), and for subtype B clusters between 4.42 and 36.44 infections/100 person years (IQR: 7.38, 15.04). Statistical analysis revealed that the average difference in the transmission rate between the PWID and the MSM clusters was 6.73 (95% CI: 0.86 to 12.60; p = 0.026). Our study provides evidence that the date of introduction of subtype A1 in Greece was the earliest in Europe. Transmission rates were significantly higher for PWID than MSM clusters due to the conditions that gave rise to an extensive PWID HIV-1 outbreak ten years ago in Athens, Greece. Transmission rate can be considered as a valuable measure for public health since it provides a proxy of the rate of epidemic growth within a cluster and, therefore, it can be useful for targeted HIV prevention programs.","output":"Dating the Origin and Estimating the Transmission Rates of the Major HIV-1 Clusters in Greece: Evidence about the Earliest Subtype A1 Epidemic in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current health crisis has led to the emergence of new practices, new tools, and an increased use of digital health.

Much research has been published on this virus, and discoveries indicate that oxidative stress contributes to the possibility of getting sick from the new SARS-CoV-2. It follows that free radical scavengers may be useful for the treatment of coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19). This report investigates the antioxidant properties of nine antivirals, two anticancer molecules, one antibiotic, one antioxidant found in orange juice (Hesperidin), one anthelmintic and one antiparasitic (Ivermectin). A molecule that is apt for scavenging free radicals can be either an electron donor or electron acceptor. The results I present here show Valrubicin as the best electron acceptor (an anticancer drug with three F atoms in its structure) and elbasvir as the best electron donor (antiviral for chronic hepatitis C). Most antiviral drugs are good electron donors, meaning that they are molecules capable of reduzing other molecules. Ivermectin and Molnupiravir are two powerful COVID-19 drugs that are not good electron acceptors, and the fact that they are not as effective oxidants as other molecules may be an advantage. Electron acceptor molecules oxidize other molecules and affect the conditions necessary for viral infection, such as the replication and spread of the virus, but they may also oxidize molecules that are essential for life. This means that the weapons used to defend us from COVID-19 may also harm us. This study posits the idea that oxide reduction balance may help explain the toxicity or efficacy of these drugs. These results represent a further advance on the road towards understanding the action mechanisms of drugs used as possible treatments for COVID-19. Looking ahead, clinical studies are needed to define the importance of antioxidants in treating COVID-19.","output":"Electron DonorCAcceptor Capacity of Selected Pharmaceuticals against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To tackle the conundrum of detecting offensive comments/posts which are considerably informal, unstructured, miswritten and code-mixed, we introduce two inventive methods in this research paper.

In the wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented various NPIs for infection control and mitigation. However, the stringency of the NPIs and the resulting impact among different countries remain unclear due to the lack of quantitative factors. In this study we took a further step to incorporate the effect of the NPIs into the pandemic dynamics model using the concept of policy intensity factor (PIF). This idea enables us to characterize the transition rates as time varying quantities instead of constant values, and thus capturing the dynamical behavior of the basic reproduction number variation in the pandemic. By leveraging a great amount of data reported by the governments and the World Health Organization, we projected the dynamics of the pandemic for the major economies in the world, including the numbers of infected, susceptible, and recovered cases, as well as the pandemic durations. It is observed that the proposed variable-rate susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (VR-SEIR) model fits and projects the pandemic dynamics very well. We further showed that the resulting PIFs correlate with the stringency of NPIs, which allows us to project the final affected numbers of people in those countries when their current NPIs have been imposed for 90, 180, 360 days.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We assessed the available early literature for histopathological patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia and underlying risk factors. RESULT: The histopathological spectrum of COVID-19 pneumonia includes variable patterns of epithelial damage, vascular complications, fibrosis and inflammation. Risk factors for a fatal disease include older age, respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity and hypertension. DISCUSSION: While some risk factors and their potential role in COVID-19 pneumonia are increasingly recognized, little is known about the mechanisms behind episodes of sudden deterioration or the infrequent idiosyncratic clinical demise in otherwise healthy and young subjects.

The total number of SSc patients registered in our hospital, in this period, was 123. Clinical data were collected from medical files of our institution and from the National Healthcare Registry platform. 53 patients needed acute hospitalization, in a total of 164 admissions. The most frequent causes for admission were: infectious diseases [27%; 70% due to pneumoniae, of which 74% had SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD)], cardiac disease (16.5%), peripheral vascular disease [12.8%; all due to digital ulcers], pulmonary hypertension (PH) (9.8%) and ILD (9.1%). There was an increase in admissions due to cardiac disease over the 10 years of follow-up, and a decrease of ILD over the last 5 years. Fourteen patients died (in-hospital mortality of 9%) mainly due to pneumoniae (36%), heart failure (21%), neoplastic diseases (21%), PH (14%) and ILD (7%). From all the admissions due to infection 70.5% were under immunosuppression at the time of the hospitalization.

To date, most data on SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has come from the sequencing of clinical samples, but such studies may suffer limitations due to costs and throughput. Wastewater-based epidemiology may provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring communities for novel variants. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cells of the human gut and is found in high concentrations in feces, wastewater may be a valuable source of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which can be deep sequenced to provide information on the circulating variants in a community.

Robots can be exceptionally useful in a smart hospital environment provided that they are equipped with improved vision capabilities for detection and avoidance of obstacles present in their path, thus allowing robots to perform their tasks without any disturbance. In the particular case of Autonomous Nursing Robots, major essential issues are effective robot path planning for the delivery of medicines to patients, measuring the patient body parameters through sensors, interacting with and informing the patient, by means of voice-based modules, about the doctors visiting schedule, his/her body parameter details, etc. This paper presents an approach of a complete Autonomous Nursing Robot which supports all the aforementioned tasks. In this paper, we present a new Autonomous Nursing Robot system capable of operating in a smart hospital environment area. The objective of the system is to identify the patient room, perform robot path planning for the delivery of medicines to a patient, and measure the patient body parameters, through a wireless BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacon receiver and the BLE beacon transmitter at the respective patient rooms. Assuming that a wireless beacon is kept at the patient room, the robot follows the beacons signal, identifies the respective room and delivers the needed medicine to the patient. A new fuzzy controller system which consists of three ultrasonic sensors and one camera is developed to detect the optimal robot path and to avoid the robot collision with stable and moving obstacles. The fuzzy controller effectively detects obstacles in the robots vicinity and makes proper decisions for avoiding them. The navigation of the robot is implemented on a BLE tag module by using the AOA (Angle of Arrival) method. The robot uses sensors to measure the patient body parameters and updates these data to the hospital patient database system in a private cloud mode. It also makes uses of a Google assistant to interact with the patients. The robotic system was implemented on the Raspberry Pi using Matlab 2018b. The system performance was evaluated on a PC with an Intel Core i5 processor, while the solar power was used to power the system. Several sensors, namely HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, Logitech HD 720p image sensor, a temperature sensor and a heart rate sensor are used together with a camera to generate datasets for testing the proposed system. In particular, the system was tested on operations taking place in the context of a private hospital in Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu, India. A detailed comparison is performed, through some performance metrics, such as Correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), against the related works of Deepu et al., Huh and Seo, Chinmayi et al., Alli et al., Xu, Ran et al., and Lee et al. The experimental system validation showed that the fuzzy controller achieves very high accuracy in obstacle detection and avoidance, with a very low computational time for taking directional decisions. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrated that the robotic system achieves superior accuracy in detecting/avoiding obstacles compared to other systems of similar purposes presented in the related works.","output":"Fuzzy Guided Autonomous Nursing Robot through Wireless Beacon Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous published articles have shown the safety and efficacy of robotic lung resection, including lobectomy.

With the advancement of technology in the recent decade, virtual implementations may provide additional support for student productivity, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic with online learning. One of the virtual realms for motivation include gamification, which has potential as an effective tool to further bolster an individuals source of intrinsic motivation. METHODUsing a convergent integrated synthesis approach, qualitative and quantitative studies were extracted from APA PsycInfo, ProQuest, and IEEE for relevance to virtual gamification and intrinsic motivation. Studies were reviewed based on a pre-determined and piloted screening tool. Included studies were published between 1990 and 2020 in English within Asia, North America, and/or Europe. Only systematic reviews, randomized control trials (RCTs), metaanalysis, and grey literature were included. Study screening, extraction, and quality appraisals using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) were performed independently among two authors. Disagreements following reconciliation between two authors were settled by a third author. Heterogeneity in study designs, outcomes, and measurements precluded meta and statistical analyses;thus, a qualitative analysis of studies was provided. RESULTSBased on the appraised articles, gamification improves intrinsic motivation through badges, social interactions, points, and leaderboards. Experimental studies also displayed a correlation between learning behaviour.

Main funding source(s): College of Physiotherapists of Catalonia INTRODUCTION: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, all over Europe imposed population lockdowns. In our country, the government approved a nationwide confinement from March 14 to April 12, which restricted the movement of people to a very specific schedule. The lockdown was then relaxed, but remained in place until June 7. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a class I level A recommendation with clinical benefits that are now well documented. The COVID-19 lockdown made it particularly difficult to achieve the goals of CR, that is, the maintenance of physical exercise and the control of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in cardiac patients. Little is known about its effects on phase III of CR program (CRP). PURPOSE: To assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on physical activity and on the adherence to a cardio-healthy lifestyle in post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. METHODS: A nested cross-sectional substudy of all patients included in a randomised clinical trial before the lockdown by means of a telephone survey during the month of May. We are conducting a randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a phase III CRP, based on counselling in the maintenance of physical exercise (time of physical exercise per week) and on reinforcing the control of CVRF for patients with ACS, once the hospital-supervised physical exercise program of a phase II CRP had been completed. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included. Mean age was 60.3 (SD 10.1) and 81.3% were men. Related to baseline, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups. One patient (3.1%) had symptoms of COVID-19. The lockdown altered the dynamics of physical exercise in 21 patients (65.6%), 20 of whom (95.2%) reported taking fewer minutes of exercise per week. After the end of the lockdown period and outdoor physical exercise was allowed once again, 11 patients (55.0%) in the control group and 9 patients (75.0%) in the intervention group found it easy to restart physical exercise. With regard to nutrition, most patients (78.1%) followed the recommendations to eat a Mediterranean diet. Five (15.6%) modified their alcohol consumption, and three smokers (33.3%) modified their tobacco consumption. When asked about their mood during the lockdown, 22 (68.8%) reported feeling well. Finally, 96.9% of patients adhered to medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown reduced the level of physical activity but more intervention group patients resumed recommended physical activity. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to result in care disruptions of varying degrees in the near future. To counteract the damaging effects of giving up physical exercise, health professionals should stay in contact with patients to motivate them to take physical exercise and encourage them to perform indoor exercise-based personalized programs to keep up the amount of exercise they take each week.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity in coronary patients on a phase III cardiac rehabilitation program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may severely impair pulmonary function and cause hypoxia. However, the association of COVID-19 pneumonia on CT with impaired ventilation remains unexplained. This pilot study aims to demonstrate the relationship between the radiological findings on COVID-19 CT images and ventilation abnormalities simulated in a computational model linked to the patients symptoms. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with COVID-19 and four test-negative healthy controls who underwent a baseline non-enhanced CT scan: 7 dyspneic patients, 9 symptomatic patients without dyspnea, and 9 asymptomatic patients were included. A 2D U-Net-based CT segmentation software was used to quantify radiological futures of COVID-19 pneumonia. The CT image-based full-scale airway network (FAN) flow model was employed to assess regional lung ventilation. Functional and radiological features were compared across groups and correlated with the clinical symptoms. Heterogeneity in ventilation distribution and ventilation defects associated with the pneumonia and the patients symptoms were assessed. RESULTS: Median percentage ventilation defects were 0.2% for healthy controls, 0.7% for asymptomatic patients, 1.2% for symptomatic patients without dyspnea, and 11.3% for dyspneic patients. The median of percentage pneumonia was 13.2% for dyspneic patients and 0% for the other groups. Ventilation defects preferentially affected the posterior lung and worsened with increasing pneumonia linearly (y = 0.91x + 0.99, R(2) = 0.73) except for one of the nine dyspneic patients who had disproportionally large ventilation defects (7.8% of the entire lung) despite mild pneumonia (1.2%). The symptomatic and dyspneic patients showed significantly right-skewed ventilation distributions (symptomatic without dyspnea: 0.86  0.61, dyspnea 0.91  0.79) compared to the patients without symptom (0.45  0.35). The ventilation defect analysis with the FAN model provided a comparable diagnostic accuracy to the percentage pneumonia in identifying dyspneic patients (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.94 versus 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pneumonia segmentations from CT scans are accompanied by impaired pulmonary ventilation preferentially in dyspneic patients. Ventilation analysis with CT image-based computational modelling shows it is able to assess functional impairment in COVID-19 and potentially identify one of the aetiologies of hypoxia in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Impaired pulmonary ventilation beyond pneumonia in COVID-19: A preliminary observation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been dramatically hit by the COVID-19 pandemic on a global scale as older age and comorbidities pose an increased risk of severe disease and death.

Probiotics are a group of living microorganisms that might affect NAFLD through the intestinal-liver axis. The present clinical trial aims to examine the effect of probiotic yogurt consumption on liver enzymes, steatosis and liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with NAFLD will be recruited in this study. After block matching for sex, BMI and age, patients will be randomly assigned to receive 300 g/d probiotic yogurt containing 10(6) cfu/g of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis strains or 300 g/d plain yogurt daily for 12 weeks and those in the control group would receive similar amounts of plain yogurts. Weight, height, and waist circumference will be measured at study baseline and after the intervention. Biochemical indicators including plasma glucose, serum insulin, lipid profile, liver markers (ALT, AST and GGT) will be examined at study baseline and at the end of the trial. Insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity will be determined using the HOMA-IR and QUICKI equation. The degree of steatosis and hepatic fibrosis will also be assessed at the beginning and end of the intervention by the same gastroenterologist using elastography with fibroscan. DISCUSSION: Probiotics have been suggested as a new strategy in the management of NAFLD. Their effects might be mediated through intestinal microbiota modification and production of short-chain fatty acids. Consumption of probiotic-enriched foods, rather than their supplements, might be a cost-effective method for long-term use in these patients. In case of finding the beneficial effects of probiotic yogurt consumption in the current clinical trial, its inclusion in the dietary plan of NAFLD patients can be recommended.

As a result, millions of pregnant and lactating women and their infants remain susceptible to the virus. METHODS: We measured Spike-specific immunoglobulin G (anti-S IgG) and A (anti-S IgA) in serum and breastmilk (BM) samples from 3 prospective mother-infant cohorts recruited in two academic medical centers. The primary aim was to determine the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 immunization vs infection and their timing on systemic and mucosal immunity. RESULTS: The study included 28 mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late pregnancy (INF), 11 uninfected mothers who received 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in the latter half of pregnancy (VAX-P) and 12 uninfected mothers who received 2 doses of BNT162b2 during lactation (VAX-L). VAX dyads had significantly higher serum anti-S IgG compared to INF dyads (p < .0001), while INF mothers had higher BM: serum anti-S IgA ratios compared to VAX mothers (p = .0001). Median IgG placental transfer ratios were significantly higher in VAX-P compared to INF mothers (p < 0.0001). There was a significant positive correlation between maternal and neonatal serum anti-S IgG after vaccination (r = 0.68, p = 0.013), but not infection. CONCLUSIONS: BNT161b2 vaccination in late pregnancy or lactation enhances systemic immunity through serum anti-S Ig, while SARS-CoV-2 infection induces mucosal over systemic immunity more efficiently through BM Ig production.

We estimate the viral dynamics using viral copy number at first detection combined with considerations arising from aerosol transmission. We take into account the recent findings that infected vaccinated adults may have live viral loads at the same level as infected unvaccinated adults. Our estimates suggest that twice weekly testing, which was adequate for the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 will be insufficient on its own to contain the spread of the Delta variant of concern. We exclude consideration of contact tracing since the rapidity of the onset of viral titre in the case of the Delta variant suggests that unless contact tracing and quarantine are performed very rapidly (ie. much less than a day), these mitigations will be of minimal impact in reducing transmission. These crude estimates do not take into account heterogeneity of susceptibility, social activity, and compliance, nor do they include the additional reduction in transmission that could be achieved by masking and social distancing. In the setting of a large public university, these considerations suggest that risk-targeted testing of vaccinated students, staff and faculty combined with surveillance testing of all unvaccinated individuals is the most efficient way to reduce transmission of COVID-19.","output":"Frequency of surveillance testing necessary to reduce transmission of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Detecting and treating neuropsychological deficits after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) play a key role in regaining independence; however, detecting deficits relevant to social and professional reintegration has been difficult and optimal timing of assessments remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility of administering the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery screening module (NAB-S) to patients with aSAH, assessed its value in predicting the ability to return to work and characterized clinical as well as neuropsychological recovery over the period of 24 months. METHODS A total of 104 consecutive patients treated for aSAH were recruited. After acute treatment, follow up visits were conducted at 3, 12 and 24 months after the hemorrhage. NAB-S, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and physical examination were performed at each follow up visit. RESULTS The NAB-S could be administered to 64.9, 75.9 and 88.9% of the patients at 3, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Moderate impairment of two or more neuropsychological domains (e.g speech, executive function, etc.) significantly correlated with inability to return to work at 12 and 24 months as well as poor outcome assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) at 3, 12 and 24 months. The number of patients with favorable outcomes significantly increased from 25.5% at discharge to 56.5 and 57.1% at 3 and 12 months, respectively, and further increased to 74.1% after 24 months. CONCLUSION The NAB-S can be administered to the majority of patients with aSAH and can effectively detect clinically relevant neuropsychological deficits.

Vaccination of the elderly and chronically ill was prioritized and the interval between doses set to 12 weeks. The objective of this interim analysis was to evaluate first and second dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) in a real-world setting. METHODS: During the first five months of the campaign, a register-based cohort study was conducted in the Finnish elderly aged 70+ years and those aged 16C69 years with medical conditions predisposing to severe Covid-19 (chronically ill). Using Cox regression, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalisation was estimated comparing the hazard in the vaccinated with that in the unvaccinated. RESULTS: The cohorts included 901092 elderly (89% vaccinated) and 774526 chronically ill (69% vaccinated) individuals. Three weeks after the first dose, mRNA VE against infection was 45% (95% confidence interval, 36C53%) and 40% (26C51%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalisation was 63% (49C74%) and 82% (56C93%). In chronically ill, AdV VE was 42% (32C50) and 62% (42C75%) against infection and hospitalisation, respectively. One week after the second dose, mRNA VE against infection was 75% (65C82%) and 77% (65C85%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalisation was 93% (70C98%) and 90% (29C99%). CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalisation.

Although tumors displaying a prominent or predominant cribriform feature are frequently found in CRA, this type may contain specific histologic variants with a characteristic molecular alteration. We investigated the molecular features of 51 primary CRAs with a predominant cribriform histology using array-based analyses (somatic copy number alterations [SCNA]; mRNA expression). Mutations (TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF) and DNA methylation status were also analyzed. The crypt isolation method was used to obtain isolated tumor glands of each type separately. All patients were classified by their CRA histologic subtype into two groups: well-formed gland and cribriform. Next, we performed cluster analysis to stratify SCNA and mRNA expression patterns between the two subtypes. Two distinctive subgroups were stratified based on patterns of SCNA and mRNA expression and were correlated with each histologic subtype. The cribriform type was characterized by a high frequency of SCNA compared with that of the well-formed gland type and was closely associated with the expression of specific mRNAs. In addition, the frequency of KRAS mutation was significantly higher in the cribriform type than in the well-formed gland type. Finally, there was no difference in DNA methylation status between the two subtypes. Overall, these data suggest that the cribriform type provides important insights into colorectal carcinogenesis, suggesting specific potential histologic implications based on the molecular profile.","output":"Cribriform type adenocarcinoma of the colorectum: comprehensive molecular analyses of a distinctive histologic subtype of colorectal cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a disproportionate effect among residents, family members and staff in residential care settings for older people in Ireland relative to other health care settings, particularly in wave one of the virus. The purpose of this study was to explore the COVID-19 pandemic as it was experienced by people on the front line of the virus - residents, family members and staff in residential care settings for older people in the Republic of Ireland (ROI). Method: A 2-phased mixed methods cross-sectional study was conducted. This consisted of a survey administered anonymously online shortly after the 1 st wave of the virus (June - August 2020), via our nursing and health care networks, advocacy organisations for older people and on social media targeting - staff, residents and family members. Family members who took part in the survey were invited to take part in phase 2 - qualitative one-to-one interviews which were conducted shortly after wave 2 of the virus (November - December 2020). Results: Seventy-six staff members completed the survey as well as 28 family members and 2 residents. Eleven family members took part in the qualitative interviews. Good infection control protocols, good governance/management structures, being prepared and agile responses were important factors in determining better outcomes. Isolation, loss of connectedness (to family, staff members and other residents) as well as a reduction in the level/quality of care provision led to significant adverse impacts for both residents and their families. Staff reported high levels of stress, trauma and burnout. A strong theme emerging from the qualitative element was the important role that family members typically have in supplementing care provision which suddenly and completely ceased during the pandemic. This caused huge distress amongst family members and physical decline and mental anguish amongst residents. Conclusions: This is the first research study to explore the experiences of residents, family members and staff who were at the front line of the pandemic in residential care settings in ROI when the pandemic struck. This study provides valuable insights which could be used by staff in residential care settings, policy makers/implementers in further waves of the pandemic or in future communicable disease outbreaks. The rights and needs of residents must be carefully balanced with infection control and prevention measures. Strategies to ensure that residents and staff are appropriately supported during future waves of the pandemic should now be implemented.","output":"Insights From The Frontline of COVID-19 in Residential Care Settings for Older People in The Republic of Ireland: A Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GS-5734 is a monophosphate prodrug of an adenosine nucleoside analog that showed therapeutic efficacy in a non-human primate model of Ebola virus infection.

Altered abundance levels of ODF2 and UBQLN3 have been reported in patients with different spermatogenic impairments. However, the transcriptional regulation of these two genes by miR-23a/b-3p is still unclear. OBJECTIVES To investigate experimentally whether miR-23a/b-3p targets the genes ODF2 and UBQLN3 and whether this targeting impacts abundance levels of ODF2 and UBQLN3 in patients with oligoasthenozoospermia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 92 men attending a fertility clinic were included in the study, including 46 oligoasthenozoospermic men and 46 age-matched normozoospermic volunteers who served as controls. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blot, and dual-luciferase (Firefly-Renilla) assays were used to validate the miRNAs and their target genes. RESULTS RT-qPCR revealed that miR-23a/b-3p was more abundant and ODF2 and UBQLN3 targets were less abundant in men with impaired spermatogenesis. Besides, Western blot shows that ODF2 and UBQLN3 protein levels were reduced in men with impaired spermatogenesis. In silico prediction and dual-luciferase assays revealed that potential links exist between the higher abundance level of miR-23a/b-3p and the lower abundance level of ODF2 and UBQLN3 targets. Mutations in the miR-23a/b-3p-binding site within the 3'UTRs (3'untranslated regions) of ODF2 and UBQLN3 genes resulted in abrogated responsiveness to miR-23a/b-3p. Correlation analysis showed that sperm count, motility, and morphology were negatively correlated with miR-23a/b-3p and positively correlated with the lower abundance level of UBQLN3, while ODF lower abundance level was positively correlated with sperm motility.

The beginning of the intervention was on 23 January 2020, and thus, there were 160 weeks before the intervention and 32 weeks after the implementation of the intervention. Level changes between expected and observed hospital visits in the post-intervention period were estimated using quasi-Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Compared with the expected level, there was an estimated decrease of ?22.60% (95% confidence interval (CI): ?27.53%, ?17.36%) in the observed total hospital visits following the intervention. Observed hospital visits for diseases of the respiratory system were found to be decreased dramatically (?62.25%; 95% CI: ?65.62%, ?58.60%). However, observed hospital visits for certain diseases were estimated to be increased, including diseases of the nervous system (+11.17%; 95% CI: +3.21%, +19.74%); diseases of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (+27.01%; 95% CI: +17.89%, +36.85%); certain conditions originating in the perinatal period (+45.05%; 95% CI: +30.24%, +61.56%); and congenital malformation deformations and chromosomal abnormalities (+35.50%; 95% CI: +21.24%, +51.45%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided scientific evidence that cause-specific hospital visits evolve differently following the intervention during the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 on hospital visits in Ningbo, China: an interrupted time-series analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vascular calcification is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in end stage renal disease, and particularly in hemodialysis patients. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with vascular calcification among this category of patients. Cholecalciferol or vitamin D3; the native inactivated 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], has been proposed to have a good impact on vascular calcification and vitamin D deficiency. However, clinical data is still limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out to evaluate the effect of oral cholecalciferol on vascular calcification and 25(OH)D levels in hemodialysis patients. A total of sixty eligible hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (Oral 200.000IU Cholecalciferol per month) or a placebo group, for 3 months. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23), osteoprotegerin (OPG), calcium, phosphorus, their product (CaXP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, were all assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT03602430. Cholecalciferol significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D and fetuin-A in the treatment group (p-value < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the placebo group. Cholecalciferol administration showed no effect on either FGF-23 or OPG. None of the treatment group patients experienced any adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Cholecalciferol was shown to be an effective, tolerable, inexpensive pharmacotherapeutic option to overcome vitamin D deficiency, with a possible modulating effect on fetuin-A, among hemodialysis patients.

Examples are emerging infections such as HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, deliberate release of microorganisms, such as the anthrax episode in the USA, the increasing problems with organisms resistant to antimicrobial treatment, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the threat of a new influenza pandemic with a case fatality rate similar to that in the 1918 outbreak. An effective response to infectious disease emergencies requires careful planning and establishment of resources in advance. The medical specialties involved are clinical microbiology, clinical infectious diseases and epidemiology. Clinical microbiology should include bacteriology, virology and parasitology; the technical developments during the last 15 years have clearly erased most of the methodological differences between these branches of microbiology. New techniques such as new generations of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), rapid methods for nucleic acid sequence analyses and microarrays have enabled more rapid identification of organisms and provide powerful tools in the epidemiological analysis of an outbreak. The infectious disease specialists are necessary for rapid and adequate clinical diagnoses, optimal use of antimicrobial agents and provision of facilities for containment of patients who may spread the infections. The need for isolation units became acute when many countries prepared themselves for a possible severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Europe. With few exceptions, Europe still lacks epidemiological field forces, and it has been embarrassing to be obliged to call upon the Centers for Disease Control for European outbreaks.

Statistical analyses were performed using R software (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020180309).ResultsA total of 106,713 people exposed to the trauma resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak were identified in the 76 articles, of which 33,810 were reported with post-traumatic stress symptoms. The pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak was 28.34%, with a 95% confidence interval of 23.03-34.32%. Subgroup analysis indicated that older age, male and bigger sample size were associated with higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. After controlling for other factors, the results of meta-regression showed that the influence of gender and sample size on prevalence is no longer significant.ConclusionsSymptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were very common among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.

Immune (i.e. \\"convalescent\\") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples, where convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure to undertake collections and construct inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections and transfusion itself. Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease).

The S1 coronavirus subunit of S-proteins contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is able to recognize different host receptors, highlighting its remarkable capacity to adapt to their hosts along the viral evolution. While RBD in spike proteins is determinant for the virus-receptor interaction, the active residues lie at the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which is part of RBD and plays a fundamental role binding the outer surface of their receptors. Here, we address the hypothesis that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains able to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins have adapted their RBM along the viral evolution to explore specific conformational topology driven by the amino acid residues YGF to infect host cells.

Unlike the reference procedure, monopolar-transurethral resection of the prostate (M-TURP), GL-PVP can be performed as a day case. As waiting list pressures continue to burden health boards across the UK, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, enhanced access to day case surgery to optimise patient flow is now of paramount importance. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of day case GL-PVP at our high-volume UK centre and identified predictors of a postoperative overnight stay. Material and Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of all patients who underwent primary GL-PVP at a single institution between October 2016 and June 2021. All procedures were performed utilising the 180W GreenLight XPS? laser therapy system. Various clinical, operative and functional data were col-lated, and outcomes were compared between patients who underwent day case surgery and those admitted overnight postoperatively. Results In all, 538 patients underwent GL-PVP during the study period. Median patient age was 72 (interquartile range (IQR) 66C77), and median prostate volume was 62.5cc (IQR 45C90). Five hundred nineteen patients (96.5%) were discharged within 23 hours of admission, and 366 patients (68.0%) were managed as a true day case. Operative and functional outcomes were comparable between patients managed as a day case and those admitted overnight. There was higher patient-reported satisfaction and a lower rate of early hospital readmission in the day-case group. On univariate logistic regression analysis, patients aged 80 years (Odds Ratio 2.64 [95% Confidence Interval 1.65C 4.24], p = < 0.001), those with American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification score 3 (OR 1.92 [95% CI 1.33C2.78], p = < 0.001), those with prostate volume 80cc (OR 1.62 [95% CI 1.00C2.61], p = 0.05) and those in whom the operation time 60 minutes (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.10C2.52], p = 0.02) were more likely to be admitted overnight following GL-PVP. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, age 80 (OR 2.64 [95% CI 1.47C4.73], p = 0.001) and ASA score 3 (OR 2.03 [95% CI 1.28C3.22], p = 0.003) remained predictive variables of an overnight stay. Conclusion From our observations of a large cohort of patients over a study period of almost five years, day case GL-PVP is a feasible concept and does not appear to compromise perioperative outcomes. With appropriate service redesign and optimisation of postoperative patient pathways, day case GL-PVP can be established in other centres and may have a role in alleviating waiting list pressures.","output":"Day case greenlight laser photoselective vaporisation of the prostate (Gl-pvp): Evaluation of outcomes from a district general hospital experience of 538 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of selected social impacts as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic is focused on an interdisciplinary approach in the Czech Republic in dealing with this crisis situation. The virus first appeared in early December 2019 in China, and on 1 March, the first positive person in the Czech Republic was confirmed. The Ministry of Health and subsequently the Government of the Czech Republic took relatively strict epidemiological measures in connection with the development of the epidemic in China, subsequently in individual countries of the European Union and in other countries throughout the world. In order to effectively implement epidemiological measures, the Government declared a state of emergency for the Czech Republic due to health threats in connection with the proof of occurrence of coronavirus SARS CoV-2 from 14.00 on 12 March 2020 for 30 days. The state of emergency was then extended until 17 May 2020. The aim of the article is to investigate the emerging solutions and impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on selected spheres of society in the Czech Republic in the period from March to April 2020, focusing on specific procedures in the South Bohemian Region. As part of the epidemiological measures, it was necessary to address the situation of socially disadvantaged groups, such as the homeless or those ordered out due to domestic violence. The case study examined the provision of care for homeless people and those ordered out due to domestic violence who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were not hospitalised or quarantined. In practice, crisis management tools in conjunction with epidemiological approaches have proven to be effective and usable.

In order to address these issues, a specialist team was established with the aim of designing and implementing a Curriculum Map (CM), which have been recognised in their ability to provide a centralised, visual representation of the curriculum. While multiple perspectives from educators to stakeholders can be considered here, the need for the CM to remain student centred was identified as key at UCLMS. The aim of this study was therefore to understand the requirements of the CM prior to production from the perspective of the medical students. METHODS: A mixed-methods sequential study was conducted. The first stage involved gathering quantitative data using a primary online survey. This used 15 questions, rated by Likert scales and focussed around three domains: depiction of content, functionality and students' likely engagement with a CM. There was a free-text question for additional comments. The second stage consisted of multiple student focus groups representing different years of the programme, conducted by trained facilitators following a predetermined scheme. Reflective Thematic Analysis (RTA) was used to synthesise the qualitative data, which was read independently by two researchers. All students at UCLMS were invited to participate in the study. RESULTS: There were 409 survey responses. 92% of students said they were 'likely' or 'very likely' to use a CM, with their key intended use being to monitor their learning progress and ensure preparedness for assessments. Five key themes emerged from the focus groups, namely that students wanted a CM to be: comprehensive; simple and intuitive; able to link content throughout the course; aligned with assessment; and useful to monitor students' progress. CONCLUSIONS: Through this study, valuable insight was gained on students' ideal preferences for the CM. Understanding this was important in order to ensure that its co-design remained student-centred prior to its design and launch.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the nutritional status of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Based on MNA scores, patients were divided into non-malnutrition group (MNA &#8805; 24), the group with risk of malnutrition (MNA 17-23.5) and malnutrition group (MNA score < 17). Regression analysis was conducted to screen for risk factors for malnutrition. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were included in the study, of which 27.5% were in the group with malnutrition risk and 52.7% were in the malnutrition group. There were statistical differences in the incidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI), calf circumference,albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte counts among the three groups. Further regression analysis suggested that combined diabetes, low calf circumference, and low albumin were independent risk factors for malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19 was high, and nutritional support should be strengthened during treatment, especially for those with diabetes mellitus, low calf circumference, or low albumin.","output":"Prevalence of malnutrition and analysis of related factors in elderly patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused some disruptions on regular health services at hospitals.

World Health Organization (WHO) is working to make sure COVID-19 vaccines can be safely delivered to all those who need them. Indeed, the successful deployment and a sufficient uptake of vaccines is equally important. Acceptance and accessibility of such vaccine is a key indicator of vaccination coverage. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the determinants of intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine among school teachers in Gondar City. METHODS: An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from December, 2020 to January, 2021. A total of 301 school teachers selected using stratified simple random sampling were included. Descriptive analysis such as medians, means, proportions, standard deviations and frequencies were computed. Linear regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: The median intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine was 3.33 with interquartile range of 2.67C4.0.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SPEC was implemented at ten nursing homes in South Korea in random order using a stepped-wedge design. Data were collected on all participating older residents in the homes before the first implementation and until six months after the last implementation. The 21-month SPEC intervention guided by the chronic care model (CCM) consists of five strategies: comprehensive geriatric assessment, care planning, optional interdisciplinary case conferences, care coordination, and a cloud-based ICT tool along with free messaging app. The primary outcome was quality of care measured by a composite quality indicator (QI) from the interRAI assessment system. Usual care continued over the control periods. Nursing home staff were not blinded to the intervention. RESULTS: There were a total of 482 older nursing home residents included in the analysis. Overall quality of care measured by the composite QI was significantly improved (adjusted mean difference: -0.025 [95% CI: -0.037 ~ -0.014, p <.0001]). The intervention effect was consistent in the subgroup analysis by cognition and activities of daily living. There were no important adverse events or side effects.

We report a case series of 8 patients with COVID-19 and PRES diagnosed at two academic medical centers between March and July of 2020. The clinical, laboratory and radiographic data, treatment, and short-term outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. The mean age was 57.9  12 years, and 50% were women. Four patients had previous vascular comorbidities. All the patients suffered from severe pneumonia, requiring intensive care unit admission. Five patients were not hypertensive at presentation (all SBP < 127 mmHg). Neurologic symptoms included seizures in 7 patients; impaired consciousness in 5 patients; focal neurological signs in 3 patients; and visual disturbances in 1 patient. All patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging which indicated asymmetric T2 prolongation or diffusion changes (50%), extensive fronto-parieto-occipital involvement (25%), vascular irregularities (12.5%) and intracranial hemorrhage (25%). Four patients were treated with tocilizumab. Three patients were discharged without neurologic disability, 2 patients had persistent focal neurologic deficits and 2 expired. One patient's prognosis remains guarded. Together, these data support the relationship between PRES and endothelial dysfunction associated with severe COVID-19. In patients with severe COVID-19, PRES can be triggered by uncontrolled hypertension, or occur independently in the setting of systemic illness and certain medications.

Ozonation is commonly utilized as pre-oxidation process to enhance the disinfection of hospital wastewater during COVID-19 spread. In this study, the transformation of ribavirin, antiviral for COVID-19, during ozone/PMS-chlorine intensified disinfection process was investigated. ?OH followed by O3 accounted for the dominant ribavirin degradation in most conditions due to higher reaction rate constant between ribavirin and ?OH vs. SO4?? (1.9  109 vs. 7.9  107 M?1 s?1, respectively). During the O3/PMS process, ribavirin was dehydrogenated at the hydroxyl groups first, then lost the amide or the methanol group. Chloride at low concentrations (e.g., 0.5~2 mg/L) slightly accelerated ribavirin degradation, while bromide, iodide, bicarbonate, and dissolved organic matter all reduced the degradation efficiency. In the presence of bromide, O3/PMS process resulted in the formation of organic brominated oxidation by-products (OBPs), the concentration of which increased with increasing bromide dosage. However, the formation of halogenated OBPs was negligible when chloride or iodide existed. Compared to the O3/H2O2 process, the concentration of brominated OBPs was significantly higher after ozonation or the O3/PMS process. This study suggests that the potential risks of the organic brominated OBPs should be taken into consideration when ozonation and ozone-based processes are used to enhance disinfection in the presence of bromide amid COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Transformation of antiviral ribavirin during ozone/PMS intensified disinfection amid COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently overwhelmed by a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

However, most of them are based on circumstantial evidences, like the association between latitude-related sunlight exposure and mortality rate, while studies based on patients' VitD measurements are still scarce. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the VitD levels (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin-D) from a cohort of 347 patients admitted to a northern Italian Hospital as suspected COVID-19s.

We hypothesized that viral nucleocapsid in serum or plasma may be a specific biomarker of acute infection that could enhance isolation and treatment strategies at an individualized level. Samples were obtained from a retrospective serological survey using a convenience sampling method from adult inpatient and outpatient encounters from January through March 2021. Samples were categorized along a timeline of infection (e.g. acute, late presenting, convalescent) based on timing of available SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptomatology. Nucleocapsid was quantified by digital immunoassay on the Quanterix HD-X platform. In a large sample of 1860 specimens from 1607 patients, the highest level and frequency of antigenemia were observed in samples obtained during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Levels of antigenemia were highest in samples from seronegative individuals and in those with more severe disease. Using ROC analysis, we found that antigenemia exhibited up to 85.8% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity as a biomarker for acute COVID-19. Nucleocapsid antigenemia is a sensitive and specific biomarker for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and may aid in individualized assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution or persistence, although interpretation is limited by absence of a diagnostic gold standard for active infection.","output":"Nucleocapsid antigenemia is a marker of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of COVID-19 on conducting research is far-reaching, especially for those scholars working for or alongside communities. As the pandemic continues to create and exacerbate many of the issues that communities at the margins faced pre-pandemic, such as health disparities and access to resources, it also creates particular difficulties in collaborative, co-developed participatory research and scholar-activism. These forms of community engagement require the commitment of researchers to look beyond the purview of the racialized capitalist and neoliberal structures and institutions that tend to limit the scope of our research and engagement. Both the presence of the researcher within the community as well as deep community trust in the researcher is required in order to identify and prioritize local, often counter-hegemonic forms of knowledge production, resources, and support networks. The pandemic and similar conditions of crises has likely limited opportunities for building long-term, productive relationships of mutual trust and reciprocity needed for PAR while communities refocus on meeting basic needs. The pandemic has now not only exacerbated existing disparities and made the need for engaged, critical and co-creative partnerships even greater, it has also abruptly halted opportunities for partnerships to occur, and further constrained funds to support communities partnering with researchers. In this paper we highlight accomplishments and discuss the many challenges that arise as participatory action researchers are displaced from the field and classroom, such as funding obstacles and working remotely. An analysis of experiences of the displacement of the scholar exposes the conflicts of conducting PAR during crises within a state of academic capitalism. These experiences are drawn from our work conducting PAR during COVID-19 around the globe, both in urban and rural settings, and during different stages of engagement. From these findings the case is made for mutual learning from peer-experiences and institutional support for PAR. As future crises are expected, increased digital resources and infrastructure, academic flexibility and greater consideration of PAR, increased funding for PAR, and dedicated institutional support programs for PAR are needed.

The mortality rate is higher, particularly in elderly population and in patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease, and malignancy. Among them, subjects with diabetes have a high risk of developing severe form of COVID-19 and show increased mortality. How diabetes contributes to COVID-19 severity remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that it may be correlated with the effects of hyperglycemia on systemic inflammatory responses and immune system dysfunction. Vitamin D (VD) is a modulator of immune-response. Data from literature showed that vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 patients increases COVID-19 severity, likely because of its negative impact on immune and inflammatory responses. Therefore, the use of vitamin D might play a role in some aspects of the infection, particularly the inflammatory state and the immune system function of patients. Moreover, a piece of evidence highlighted a link among vitamin D deficiency, obesity and diabetes, all factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Given this background, we performed an overview of the systematic reviews to assess the association between vitamin D supplementation and inflammatory markers in patients with diabetes; furthermore, vitamin Ds possible role in COVID-19 patients was assessed as well.

Recent studies reveal that IFN dysregulation is key to determine COVID-19 pathogenesis. Effective IFN stimulation or prophylactic administration of IFNs at the early stage prior to severe COVID-19 may elicit an autonomous antiviral state, restrict the virus infection, and prevent COVID-19 progression. Inborn genetic flaws and autoreactive antibodies that block IFN response have been significantly associated with about 14% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. In most severe COVID-19 patients without genetic errors in IFN-relevant gene loci, IFN dysregulation is progressively worsened and associated with the situation of pro-inflammation and immunopathy, which is prone to autoimmunity. In addition, the high correlation of severe COVID-19 with seniority, males, and individuals with pre-existing comorbidities will be plausibly explained by the coincidence of IFN aberrance in these situations.

METHODS: 39 Patients confirmed by RT-PCR were included. We collected clinical features, laboratory test results, smear sample information, and quarantine room information. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were conducted. We analyzed the factors associated with environmental contamination. RESULT: Among 39 COVID-19 cases, 10 were asymptomatic and 37 were imported from aboard. We collected 271 swab samples from environmental surfaces related to observational patients. Eighteen swab samples from seven patients were positive. The highest contamination rates occurred on cups (100%), followed by hand sink (12.82%), toilet seat and flush (7.89%), telephone (5.56%), bedside table (5.56%), and floor drain (5.41%). The results showed that environmental surface contamination was associated with the clinical cycle threshold values for patients (P = 0.01) and the sampling interval time after the cases left their rooms (P = 0.03). The duration of environmental surface contamination was associated with the wet status of the sampling site (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that environmental contamination might be attributed to the viral load in the respiratory tracts of patients and the sampling interval time after the cases left their rooms. Moist surfaces were more vulnerable to remaining SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive. Our study highlights the importance of implementing strict chemical disinfection strategies in quarantine rooms.","output":"Duration of SARS-CoV-2 positive in quarantine room environments: A perspective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We undertook a 2X2 factorial, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess whether vitamin D(3) supplementation (10,000 international units per week) versus placebo and gargling versus no gargling could prevent viral, clinical upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in university students. METHODS: We randomized 600 students into 4 treatment arms: 1) vitamin D(3) and gargling, 2) placebo and gargling, 3) vitamin D(3) and no gargling, and 4) placebo and no gargling. Students completed weekly electronic surveys and submitted self-collected mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs during September and October in 2010 or 2011. Symptomatic students also completed an electronic symptom diary. The primary and secondary outcomes were the occurrence of symptomatic clinical URTI and laboratory confirmed URTI respectively. RESULTS: Of 600 participants, 471 (78.5%) completed all surveys while 43 (7.2%) completed none; 150 (25.0%) reported clinical URTI. Seventy participants (23.3%) randomized to vitamin D(3) reported clinical URTI compared to 80 (26.7%) randomized to placebo (RR:0.79, CI(95):0.61-1.03, p = 0.09). Eighty-five participants (28.3%) randomized to gargling reported clinical URTI compared to 65 participants (21.7%) randomized to the no gargling arm (RR:1.3, CI(95):0.92-1.57, p = 0.19). Laboratory testing identified 70 infections (46.7 per 100 URTIs). Vitamin D(3) treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk for laboratory confirmed URTI (RR: 0.54, CI(95):0.34-0.84, p = 0.007) and with a significantly lower mean viral load measured as log(10) viral copies/mL (mean difference: -0.89, CI(95:) -1.7, -0.06, p = 0.04). Fewer students assigned to gargling experienced laboratory confirmed URTI, however this was not statistically significant (RR:0.82, CI(95):0.53-1.26, p = 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that vitamin D(3) is a promising intervention for the prevention of URTI. Vitamin D(3) significantly reduced the risk of laboratory confirmed URTI and may reduce the risk of clinical infections.

The extant literature focuses on psychiatric resilience in the context of internalizing symptoms, though resilience is also important in relation to externalizing symptoms. Research is needed to clarify the predictors of resilience across contexts. The aims of the current study are twofold: 1. Determine the association between psychiatric resilience (PR) and alcohol resistance (AR) and 2. Test for differential prediction of each form of resilience by exogenous predictors. METHODS: The sample (n = 7585) was drawn from the Virginia Adult Twin Studies of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders (VATSPSUD). Participants completed measures of internalizing symptoms, exposure to stressful life events, DSM alcohol abuse and dependence symptoms, maximum alcohol consumption, personality variables, and social support. All cross-sectional, structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were conducted using Mplus software version 8.2. RESULTS: A single common factor model provided adequate fits for both PR and AR. In the full measurement model the correlation between the two resilience factors was estimated (r = 0.28, SE = 0.018, p < 0.001). Neuroticism and mastery predicted AR and PR, but differentially, with a stronger effect size for PR (neuroticism: B = 0.35, p < 0.001; mastery: B = - 0.36, p < 0.001). The positive social support factor did not predict either resilience variable, while interpersonal conflict was associated with both (AR = 0.09, p < 0.001; PR = 0.07, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Findings extend the current literature on resilience in two ways. First, rigorous measurement model based definitions of two resilience variables are specified. Second, external validation of the AR and PR constructs is carried out using latent variable modeling techniques. The modest correlation suggests resilience may not be well-characterized by a single general attribute. Findings provide further evidence for predictors of resilience by way of displaying differential patterns of prediction effect sizes of PR and AR.","output":"Modeling the association between and predictors of two constructs of resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AbstractParenting is critical to creating and maintaining healthy child development. Importantly, there are multiple determinants of effective parenting, including the psychological resources of the parent, contextual sources of stress and support, and characteristics of the child. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in colossal disruptions to family life, and has fundamentally altered the landscape of parenting. In the face of escalating infection and mortality rates, rising unemployment, financial insecurity, school closures, and shelter-in-place orders, parents have had to create new environments in which their children can flourish while, in many cases, continuing to juggle ongoing work, health, and emotional stressors of their own. Several recent reviews have offered a variety of recommendations for parents to promote child well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, no measures have been developed to assess how parents have adapted their parenting behaviors in response to the pandemic. To better understand the lasting impact of the pandemic on childrens socioemotional health and well-being, we urgently need to characterize the impact of the pandemic on parenting practices. Accordingly, the current study developed the 24-item Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS) to assess behaviors enacted by parents to mitigate infection risk, manage childrens social and emotional needs, structure childrens activities, help with schoolwork or education, and promote physical activity. The scale is available in English and Spanish and is freely accessible for research, educational, or scientific purposes. We anticipate the PIPS being employed in studies alongside other, validated measures of parenting practices, parenting stress, or parental burnout, as well as in relation to measures of child mental health and resilience in the face of the pandemic.","output":"Development of the Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During this pandemic the importance of oral health and its connection to systemic health-as well as maintaining dental visits-must be emphasized to patients and the public Oral hygiene must be sustained, if not improved, in order to reduce bacterial load in the mouth and, therefore, the potential risk of bacterial superinfection","output":"Could Poor Oral Hygiene Increase the Risk of COVID-19 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between vitamin D deficiency and increased morbidity/mortality with COVID-19 respiratory dysfunction DESIGN: Scoping review DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 24 of April 2020) and PubMed (2020 to 17 of September 2020) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: A search using the search terms: [(cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol or vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 or vitamin D or 25OHD) and (SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus or COVID or betacoronavirus or MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV or respiratory infection or acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS)]m p was conducted on the 24/04/2020 (Search A) and 17/09/2020 (Search B) RESULTS: 91 studies were identified as being concerned with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI)/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and vitamin D, and 25 publications specifically explored the role of vitamin D deficiency in the development and progression of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 related ARDS Search \\"A\\" identified three main themes of indirect evidence supporting such an association Consistent epidemiological evidence exists linking low vitamin D levels to increased risk and severity of respiratory tract infections We also report on plausible biological processes supporting such an association;and present weaker evidence supporting the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk and severity of ARIs Uncertainty remains about what constitutes an appropriate dosing regimen in relation to reducing risk/severity of ARI/ARDS More recent evidence (Search B) provided new insights into some direct links between vitamin D and COVID-19;with a number of cohort and ecological studies supporting an association with PCR-positivity for SARS-CoV-2 and vitamin D deficiency The exact efficacy of the vitamin D supplementation for prevention of, or as an adjunct treatment for COVID-19 remains to be determined;but a number of randomized control trials (RCTs) currently underway are actively investigating these potential benefits CONCLUSION: Our rapid review of literature supports the need for observational studies with COVID-19 infected populations to measure and assess vitamin D levels in relation to risk/severity and outcomes;alongside RCTs designed to evaluate the efficacy of supplementation both in preventive and therapeutic contexts The overlap in the vitamin D associated biological pathways with the dysregulation reported to drive COVID-19 outcomes warrants further investigation","output":"Association Between Vitamin D and Novel SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Dysfunction - A Scoping Review of Current Evidence and Its Implication for COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growth of the organic product market is consistent with a worldwide trend of rising demand, owing primarily to improved living quality.

Twenty-three studies evaluating One Health initiatives were eligible. Most studies included the human (n = 22) and animal (n = 15) sectors; only four included the environment sector. The types of evaluated initiative (non-exclusive) included governance (n = 5), knowledge (n = 6), protection (n = 17), promotion (n = 16), prevention (n = 9), care (n = 8), advocacy (n = 10) and capacity (n = 10).

Whether risk is linked to HIV-related factors, demographics or comorbid burden is unclear. We examine risk factors and outcomes of those living with HIV who acquired COVID-19 and received care within two large healthcare systems in Denver, CO. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for all individuals with HIV diagnosed with COVID-19 at the two largest Colorado HIV care centers between 1 March and 31 October 2020. COVID-19 diagnosis required a positive PCR result;HIV diagnosis was extracted from the medical record. Risk factors forhospitalization and longer hospital length of stay (LOS) were examined and compared via univariate and multivariable analysis. Results: Among 94 patients, 81% were male, with a mean age of 46 (SD 13.5) years. The majority had HIV-1 RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL (87%) and CD4 count &gt;500 cells/mm3 (55%). Most (75%) had 1 comorbidity;64% were overweight or obese. 39% of patients were admitted to the hospital (17% to intensive care). Increased odds of hospitalization were associated with increased age, lower CD4 count, and increased number of comorbidities (including diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, mental health concerns, and obesity) (Table). In multivariable analyses, only lower CD4 count (OR 1.28) and comorbidity count (OR 1.62) remained significant. Among hospitalized patients, longer LOS was univariately associated with age (52% longer LOS per 10 year age increase [95% CI 16,101%], p=0.004) but not CD4 count (-8%, [95% CI-18, 5%] % change in LOS per 100 cell/mm3 increase, p=0.21), HIV-1 viral load 200 copies/mL (-33% [95% CI-77, 90%], p=0.44), or comorbidity count (10% [95% CI-17, 43%] change in LOS per additional comorbidity, p=0.49). Sensitivity analyses excluding 9 patients hospitalized for non-COVID reasons provided similar findings. Conclusion: Lower CD4 count was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization among patients with concurrent HIV and COVID-19, suggesting that successful HIV treatment remains a key component to decreasing HIV-related morbidity.

Social support has been identified as a significant factor in the successful adoption of lifestyle change for people with type 2 diabetes, however people with mental illness often have impoverished social networks leading to greater reliance upon professional care givers. This study maps the support provided by formal (paid and professional carers) and informal networks to people with mental illness and type 2 diabetes, comparing the experiences of people with a spouse with those without one. METHODS Interviews were conducted with 29 clients of a community nursing service with mental health problems who receive professional support to self-manage type 2 diabetes. Participants were asked to complete an egocentric social network map which involved mapping the people and services who support them to manage their health. Demographic data was collected as was data about co-morbidities and service use within the last 6 months. Network maps were supplemented by a series of open-ended questions about self-management practices, who supports these practices and what support they provide. RESULTS Participants identified small social networks with few friendship ties. These networks had diminished due to illness. For people with a spouse, this person provided significant support for chronic illness self-management performing a range of daily care and illness management tasks. People without a spouse were more reliant on professional and paid care givers for daily care and illness management. People without a spouse also demonstrated greater reliance upon weak social ties for emotional support and social connection and often developed friendships with formal caregivers. CONCLUSIONS Spousal support reduces the need for professional services.

Here, we report the results from a prospective study that started during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, where we identified 91 convalescents from mild SARS-CoV-2 infection among 4554 health care workers. We followed the dynamics and magnitude of spike-specific immunity in convalescents during the spontaneous course over  9 months, after SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure and after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Virus-neutralizing antibodies and spike-specific T cell responses with predominance of IL-2-secreting polyfunctional CD4 T cells continuously declined over 9 months, but remained detectable at low levels. After a single vaccination, convalescents simultaneously mounted strong antibody and T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. In na?ve individuals, a prime vaccination induced preferentially IL-2-secreting CD4 T cells that preceded production of spike-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies after boost vaccination. Response to vaccination, however, was not homogenous. Compared to four individuals among 455 na?ve vaccinees (0.9%), we identified 5/82 (6.1%) convalescents with a delayed response to vaccination. These convalescents had originally developed dysfunctional spike-specific immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and required prime and boost vaccination to develop strong spike-specific immunity. Importantly, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in fall/winter of 2021 and prior to vaccination we detected a surge of virus-neutralizing antibodies consistent with re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in 6 out of 82 convalescents. The selective increase in virus-neutralizing antibodies occurred without systemic re-activation of spike-specific T cell immunity, whereas a single BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination sufficed to induce strong spike-specific antibody and systemic T cell responses in the same individuals. These results support the notion that BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination synchronizes spike-specific immunity in all convalescents of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and may provide additional protection from re-infection by inducing more rigorous stimulation of spike-specific T cell immunity than re-exposure with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Long-term follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 convalescents reveals distinct magnitude of spike-specific immunity after viral re-exposure and vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the Tunisian healthcare system To reduce the risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended deferral of elective cardiac procedures, including coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for stable coronary artery disease (CAD) Purpose: However anecdotal reports suggest also a decline in the number of patients consulting for an unstable CAD and therefore in the activity of the catheterization laboratory Methods: To confirm this finding, we conducted a study comparing the number of patients who consulted for an unstable CAD and who benefited from a CA associated or not with a PCI during the confinement period (CP) (from March 15, 2020 to April 30, 2020) and just 6 weeks before (from February 1, 2020 to March 15, 2020) in Mongi Slim La Marsa University Hospital Center Results: Our analysis showed that out of 183 patients with unstable CAD, 127 (69,4%) and 56 (30 6%) consulted and were urgently treated in our catheterization laboratory respectively before and during the confinement period thus an estimated 40% reduction in our daily activity (Fig 1) Conclusion: Potential etiologies for the decrease in unstable patients with CAD may be related to the avoidance of medical care due to social distancing or concerns of contracting COVID-19 in the hospital and ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction misdiagnosis As long as the pandemic continues, we highly recommend to follow this signal and investigate its causes","output":"Activity of a catheterization laboratory in Tunisia: A comparative study before and during confinement (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health promotion and prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic Consensus of experts of the National society of evidence-based pharmacotherapy and the Russian society of the prevention of non-communicable diseases","output":"Health promotion and prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction The COVID-19 health crisis precipitated the use of telehealth. To ensure continuity of care, during this period, pharmacists had the opportunity to use telecare and to offer teleconsultations with a physician to their patients. We report here on telehealth practices in a local pharmacy participating in the activities of a multidisciplinary health center (MSP). Material and methods After analyzing a situation, the pharmacists of this dispensary offered teleconsultation or telecare to the patients. The doctors solicited were those from the MSP, those from the territory and those from a teleconsultation platform. Digital tools have enabled communication between doctors, patients and pharmacists on the one hand and enabled the pharmacist to assist the doctor during the teleconsultation, while ensuring the confidentiality and protection of patient data. Results Thirteen teleconsultations and 22 telepharmacy consultations were performed. Four types of situations motivated the triggering of pharmacist-assisted teleconsultations and three of pharmaceutical telecare. The implementation of telehealth in this pharmacy required changes in the organization and management of the pharmacy, training of the pharmacy team, and closer communication with the MSP physicians. Discussion Telehealth offers major opportunities for the evolution of the pharmacist's profession and the improvement of patient care, beyond crisis situations.","output":"Retour dexprience de tlsant  lofficine : rflexions pour lamlioration et ladaptation des pratiques professionnelles pharmaceutiques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Firearm violence rates have increased in U.S. cities in 2020 and into 2021.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the major form of dementia, ?-amyloid (A?) levels in the blood are increased; however, the impact of elevated A? levels on the progression of COVID-19 remains largely unknown. Here, our findings demonstrate that A?1-42, but not A?1-40, bound to various viral proteins with a preferentially high affinity for the spike protein S1 subunit (S1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These bindings were mainly through the C-terminal residues of A?1-42. Furthermore, A?1-42 strengthened the binding of the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and increased the viral entry and production of IL-6 in a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection model. Intriguingly, data from a surrogate mouse model with intravenous inoculation of A?1-42 show that the clearance of A?1-42 in the blood was dampened in the presence of the extracellular domain of the spike protein trimers of SARS-CoV-2, whose effects can be prevented by a novel anti-A? antibody. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the binding of A?1-42 to the S1 of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 may have a negative impact on the course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and examine whether reducing the level of A?1-42 in the blood is beneficial to the fight against COVID-19 and AD.","output":"The Effects of A?1-42 Binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein S1 Subunit and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We aimed to assess patients' and physicians' perspectives on wider implementation of telemedicine in radiation oncology practice, disrupted by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Quantitative questionnaires were prepared and distributed between May 27 and June 11, 2020. A 29-question survey targeting patients with cancer was distributed electronically via cancer support organizations. Cross-sectional data from a selected weekday at a radiation oncology department were also analyzed. In addition, a 25-question survey was distributed to 168 physicians employed by a comprehensive cancer center. RESULTS: In total, we have analyzed 468 patients' and 101 physicians' responses. Among responding patients, 310 were undergoing active treatment and 158 were in follow-up care. Both patients and physicians reported no experiences with video consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic, but 15% of patients stated that they missed telemedicine services that would include a video call. Overall, 30.6% of patients expressed interest in more frequent usage of telemedicine and 23.3% would start using it. Sixty-seven percent of radiation oncologists expressed interest in more frequent usage of telemedicine, and 14% would use it similarly as in the past. For patients treated with radiation therapy (RT), 59.9% and 63.4% of the responding patients acknowledged that video consultations would be an important addition to medical care during RT course or after the completion of RT, respectively. Comparably, 61.1% and 63.9% of radiation oncologists believed video consultations would be useful or extremely useful for patients undergoing RT or for patients in the follow-up setting, respectively.

However, this is dependent on the availability of specific affinity adsorbents for each particular target protein. The diversity of proteins to be purified augments the complexity and number of specific affinity adsorbents needed, and therefore generic platforms for the purification of recombinant proteins are appealing strategies. This justifies why genetically encoded affinity tags became so popular for recombinant protein purification, as these systems only require specific ligands for the capture of the fusion protein through a pre-defined affinity tag tail. There is a wide range of available affinity pairs tag-ligand combining biological or structural affinity ligands with the respective binding tags.

Ten patients (40%) had detectable responses, displaying frequencies ranging from 0.15 to 2.7% (median of 0.57 cells/L; range, 0.43-9.98 cells/L). The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-?3 CD8+ T cells in patients admitted to intensive care was comparable (P = .28) to the rate in patients hospitalized in other medical wards. No correlation was found between SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-?3 CD8+ T-cell counts and SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibody levels.

The following analysis considers - within a simple model - the potentially crucial role of a Corona testing approach in combination with a quarantine approach which is shown herein to be a substitute for broad lockdown measures. The cost of lockdowns/shutdowns are rather high so that C beyond progress in terms of a broad vaccination program C a rational testing strategy should also be carefully considered. Testing has to be organized on the basis of an adequate testing infrastructure which could largely be implemented in firms, schools, universities and public administration settings. As regards the cost of a systematic broad Covid-19 testing strategy, these could come close to 0.5% of national income if there are no vaccinations. The Testing & Quarantine approach suggested here C with tests for symptomatic as well as asymptomatic people - is based on a random sampling and would require rather broad and frequent testing; possibly one test per person every 7C10 days. At the same time, one should consider that the cost of further lockdowns/shutdowns of a duration of 1 month could be very high, such that a standard cost benefit analysis supports the testing approach suggested herein. Also, an optimal policy mix could be designed where both vaccinations and testing play a crucial role. As of late January 2021, no further lockdowns in Germany and other OECD countries would be necessary if a broad testing infrastructure can be established rather quickly. This in turn will reinforce economic optimism and help to jumpstart economic growth in Europe, the US and Asia in a solid way.

Outcomes assessed included perceived stress, state anxiety and depression. Aside from demographics, behaviors and attitudes assessed included exercise, diet, use of tele-psychotherapy and number of COVID-19 related risk factors, such as perceived risk of COVID-19, information overload, and feeling imprisoned. Overall, all mental health outcomes worsened from Time 1 to time 2, although there was a significant gender x time interaction for stress. 9.7% of the sample reported stress above the clinical cut-off (2 SD above mean), while 8.0% and 9.4% were above this cutoff for depression and anxiety, respectively. In repeated measures analysis, female gender, worsening diet and excess of COVID-19 information was related to all mental health outcomes. Changes in diet for the worse were associated with increases in anxiety. Exercise frequency was clearly related to state anxiety (0 days/week > 6 days/week). Those who did aerobic exercise did not have any increase in depression. Use of tele-psychotherapy predicted lower levels of depression and anxiety.

There is an instant need to discover how the new variants interact with the host receptor (ACE2). Among the reported mutations in the Spike glycoprotein of the new variants, three are specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and required insightful scrutiny for new therapeutic options. These structural evolutions in the RBD domain may impart a critical role to the unique pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 new variants. Herein, using structural and biophysical approaches, we explored that the specific mutations in the UK (N501Y), South African (K417N-E484K-N501Y), Brazilian (K417T-E484K-N501Y), and hypothetical (N501Y-E484K) variants alter the binding affinity, create new inter-protein contacts and changes the internal structural dynamics thereby increases the binding and eventually the infectivity. Our investigation highlighted that the South African (K417N-E484K-N501Y), Brazilian (K417T-E484K-N501Y) variants are more lethal than the UK variant (N501Y). The behavior of the wild type and N501Y is comparable. Free energy calculations further confirmed that increased binding of the spike RBD to the ACE2 is mainly due to the electrostatic contribution. Further, we find that the unusual virulence of this virus is potentially the consequence of Darwinian selection-driven epistasis in protein evolution. The triple mutants (South African and Brazilian) may pose a serious threat to the efficacy of the already developed vaccine. Our analysis would help to understand the binding and structural dynamics of the new mutations in the RBD domain of the Spike protein and demand further investigation in in vitro and in vivo models to design potential therapeutics against the new variants.","output":"Higher infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 new variants is associated with K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y mutants: An insight from structural data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research is constantly engaged in finding more productive and powerful ways to support quality learning and teaching.

Given the surge of e-commerce and the ever-increasing volume of goods to be delivered, we explore possible logistic solutions by proposing algorithms to add parcel-transport services to ride-hailing systems. Toward this end, we present and solve mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of the share-a-ride problem and quantitatively analyze the service revenues and use of vehicle resources. We create five scenarios that represent joint transportation situations for parcels and people, and that consider different densities in request types and different requirements for vehicle resources. For one scenario, we propose an alternative MILP formulation that significantly reduces computation times. The proposed model also improves scalability by solving instances with 260% more requests than those solved with general MILP. The results show that the greatest profit margins occur when several parcels share trips with customers. In contrast, with all metrics considered, the worst results occur when parcels and people are transported in separate dedicated vehicles. The integration of parcel services in ride-hailing systems also reduces vehicle waiting times when the number of parcel requests exceeds the number of ride-hailing customers.","output":"Share-a-ride problems: Models and Solution Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not well established. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on long-term prognosis in patients hospitalized with CAP. METHODS: This was a multicenter study assessing complications developed during 1 year of patients previously hospitalized with CAP who had been included in a randomized clinical trial concerning the duration of antibiotic treatment. Mortality at 90 days, at 180 days and at 1 year was analyzed, as well as new admissions and cardiovascular complications. A subanalysis was carried out in one of the hospitals by measuring C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and proadrenomedullin (proADM) at admission, at day 5 and at day 30. RESULTS: A total of 312 patients were included, 150 in the control group and 162 in the intervention group. Ninety day, 180 day and 1-year mortality in the per-protocol analysis were 8 (2.57%), 10 (3.22%) and 14 (4.50%), respectively. There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of 1-year mortality (p = 0.94), new admissions (p = 0.84) or cardiovascular events (p = 0.33). No differences were observed between biomarker level differences from day 5 to day 30 (CRP p = 0.29; PCT p = 0.44; proADM p = 0.52).

This dual-center retrospective cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence of depression in young adults during this pandemic and explored its association with various physical fitness measures. METHODS: This study enrolled 12,889 (80% female) young adults (mean age 20  1) who performed a National Student Physical Fitness battery from December 1st, 2019, to January 20th, 2020, and completed a questionnaire including Becks Depression Inventory in May 2020. Independent associations between prior physical fitness and depression during the pandemic were assessed using multivariable linear and binary logistic regressions accordingly, covariates including age, dwelling location, economic level, smoking, alcohol, living status, weight change, and exercise volume during the pandemic. Sex- and baseline stress-stratified analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the study population 13.9% of men and 15.0% of women sampled qualified for a diagnosis of depression. After multivariable adjustment, anaerobic (mean change 95% CI ?3.3 [?4.8 to 1.8]) aerobic (?1.5 [?2.64 to ?0.5]), explosive (?1.64 [?2.7 to ?0.6]) and muscular (?1.7 [?3.0 to ?0.5]) fitness were independently and inversely associated with depression for the overall population. These remained consistent after sex- and baseline stress-stratification. In binary logistic regression, the combined participants with moderate, high or excellent fitness also showed a much lower risk compared to those least fit in anaerobic (odd ratio (OR) 95% CI 0.68 [0.55C0.82]), aerobic (0.80 [0.68C0.91]), explosive (0.72 [0.61C0.82]), and muscular (0.66 [0.57C0.75]) fitness.

The spike sequence determines the binding affinity and accessibility of its receptor-binding domain to the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is responsible for host range10-12. SARS-CoV-2 progenitor bat viruses genetically close to SARS-CoV-2 and able to enter human cells through a human ACE2 (hACE2) pathway have not yet been identified, although they would be key in understanding the origin of the epidemic. Here we show that such viruses circulate in cave bats living in the limestone karstic terrain in northern Laos, in the Indochinese peninsula. We found that the receptor-binding domains of these viruses differ from that of SARS-CoV-2 by only one or two residues at the interface with ACE2, bind more efficiently to the hACE2 protein than that of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in Wuhan from early human cases, and mediate hACE2-dependent entry and replication in human cells, which is inhibited by antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. None of these bat viruses contains a furin cleavage site in the spike protein.

Past studies have proposed the determination of an adequate dose for general anaesthetics that could be used to alert providers of potentially insufficient anaesthesia. However, there have been no systematic analyses of appropriate thresholds to develop population-based alerting algorithms for preventing intraoperative awareness. OBJECTIVE To identify a threshold for intraoperative alerting that could be applied for the prevention of awareness with explicit recall. DESIGN Secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial (Michigan Awareness Control Study). SETTING Three hospitals at a tertiary care centre in the USA. PATIENTS Unselected patients presenting for surgery under general anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS Alerts based on end-tidal anaesthetic concentration or bispectral index values. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Using case and outcomes data from the primary study, end-tidal anaesthetic concentration and bispectral index values were analysed using Youden's index and c-statistics derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve to determine a specific alerting threshold for the prevention of awareness. RESULTS No single population-based threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity could be identified for the prevention of intraoperative awareness, using either anaesthetic concentration or bispectral index values. The c-statistic for anaesthetic concentration was 0.431  0.046, and 0.491  0.056 for bispectral index values. CONCLUSION We could not derive a single population-based alerting threshold for the prevention of intraoperative awareness using either anaesthetic concentration or bispectral index values.

The regulatory mechanism by which HBoV RNA transcripts are polyadenylated at proximal [(pA)p] or distal [(pA)d] polyadenylation sites is still unclear. We constructed a recombinant HBoV infectious clone to study the alternative polyadenylation regulation of HBoV. Surprisingly, in addition to the reported distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, a novel distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, which is located in the right-end hairpin (REH), was identified during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. (pA)d2 does not contain typical hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal, upstream elements (USE), or downstream elements (DSE) according to sequence analysis. Further study showed that HBoV nonstructural protein NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d were necessary and sufficient for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. The distance and sequences between (pA)d and (pA)d2 also played a key role in the regulation of polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Finally, we demonstrated that efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2 resulted in increased HBoV capsid mRNA transcripts and protein translation. Thus, our study revealed that all the bocaviruses have distal poly(A) signals on the right-end palindromic terminus, and alternative polyadenylation at the HBoV 3 end regulates its capsid expression. IMPORTANCE The distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, of HBoV is located about 400 nucleotides (nt) from the right-end palindromic terminus, which is different from those of bovine parvovirus (BPV) and canine minute virus (MVC) in the same genus whose distal polyadenylation is located in the right-end stem-loop structure. A novel polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, was identified in the right-end hairpin of HBoV during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. Sequence analysis showed that (pA)d2 does not contain typical polyadenylation signals, and the last 42 nt form a stem-loop structure which is almost identical to that of MVC. Further study showed that NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d are required for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Polyadenylation at (pA)d2 enhances capsid expression. Our study demonstrates alternative polyadenylation at the 3 end of HBoV and suggests an additional mechanism by which capsid expression is regulated.","output":"Alternative Polyadenylation of Human Bocavirus at Its 3 End Is Regulated by Multiple Elements and Affects Capsid Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present article shows a novel approach for the acquisition of competences related to physical geodesy in the Bachelor's Degree in Geomatics using virtual materials to promote the autonomous learning and support it during exceptional periods of confinement, like the Covid-19 pandemic More specifically, the article is focused in the geoid undulation determination, which is a critical issue in hydraulic works, land subsidence, and civil projects So, this concept has to be learned in the Bachelor's Degree in Geomatics for the proper acquisition of competences The approach is aimed to three-dimensional fitting techniques and statistical analysis to improve the comprehension and interpretation of the different local geoid models from the same set of field measurements, and therefore the conclusions and analysis derived from them for the subsequent Geomatic practical works The current contribution is originated from the virtual laboratories' paradigm, as it is proposed the use of virtual materials for the acquisition and evaluation of competences and skills in an asynchronous way, that can be use not only for and e-learning or b-learning programs, but also as support for traditional face to face programs The present contribution will help the students to contextualize the theoretical knowledge, so better understand the challenges they will face in the working market as future professionals ? 2020 ACM","output":"Learning physical geodesy.

Membrane compartments comprise the system limiting cells (one or two membranes in bacteria, a unique plasma membrane in eukaryotes) and a variety of internal vesicular, subspherical, tubular, or reticulated organelles. In eukaryotes, the internal membranes comprise on the one hand the general endomembrane system, a dynamic network including organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the nuclear envelope, etc. and also the plasma membrane, which are linked via direct lateral connectivity (e.g. between the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear outer envelope membrane) or indirectly via vesicular trafficking. On the other hand, semi-autonomous organelles, i.e. mitochondria and chloroplasts, are disconnected from the endomembrane system and request vertical transmission following cell division. Membranes are organized as lipid bilayers in which proteins are embedded. The budding of some of these membranes, leading to the formation of the so-called lipid droplets (LDs) loaded with hydrophobic molecules, most notably triacylglycerol, is conserved in all clades. The evolution of eukaryotes is marked by the acquisition of mitochondria and simple plastids from Gram-positive bacteria by primary endosymbiosis events and the emergence of extremely complex plastids, collectively called secondary plastids, bounded by three to four membranes, following multiple and independent secondary endosymbiosis events. There is currently no consensus view of the evolution of LDs in the Tree of Life. Some features are conserved; others show a striking level of diversification.

Even in today's most developed capitalist societies, people produce things that are not for sale and allocate them through sharing, gifts, and redistribution rather than buying and selling.

Historically, markets only emerge when states forcibly create them; community members do not tend to spontaneously start selling each other goods and services. Markets work well for coordinating complex industrial webs to satisfy individual tastes, but they are not appropriate for governing the production or distribution of entities that are non-rival, non-excludable, not produced for sale, essential need satisfiers, or culturally important. Moreover, we argue, markets do not serve justice, sustainability, efficiency, or value pluralism, the foundations of ecological economics. We sketch an agenda for research on economic practices and institutions without markets by posing nine broad questions about non-market food systems and exploring the evidence and theory around each.

METHOD: The frequency responses of three low-cost headset microphones were evaluated using pink noise generated via a head-and-torso model. Each of the headset microphones was then used to record a series of speech and vowel samples prerecorded from 24 speakers who represented a diversity of sex, age, fundamental frequency (F o), and voice quality types. Recordings were later analyzed for the following measures: smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPP; dB), low versus high spectral ratio (L/H ratio; dB), CPP F o (Hz), and cepstral spectral index of dysphonia (CSID). RESULTS: The frequency response of the microphones under test was observed to have nonsignificant effects on measures of the CPP and CPP F o, significant effects on the CSID in speech contexts, and strong and significant effects on the measure of spectral tilt (L/H ratio).

How high patterning precision is achieved despite natural variation in both the morphogen gradients and in the readout process, is still largely elusive. Here, we show that the positional error of gradients in the mouse neural tube has previously been overestimated, and that the reported accuracy of the central progenitor domain boundaries in the mouse neural tube can be achieved with a single gradient, rather than requiring the simultaneous readout of opposing gradients. Consistently and independently, numerical simulations based on measured molecular noise levels likewise result in lower gradient variabilities than reported. Finally, we show that the patterning mechanism yields progenitor cell numbers with even greater precision than boundary positions, as gradient amplitude changes do not affect interior progenitor domain sizes. We conclude that single gradients can yield the observed developmental precision, which provides prospects for tissue engineering.","output":"Precision of morphogen gradients in neural tube development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many allergens feature hydrophobic cavities that allow the binding of primarily hydrophobic small\\\\molecule ligands.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of patient cohorting upon ventral hernia repair outcomes. METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective review of open ventral hernia repairs between August 2013 and July 2017 was performed. The information of all patient locations during hospitalization, time at location, post-anesthesia care unit duration (PACU), and intensive care unit (ICU) duration was collected. Patient demographics, comorbidities, operative details, cost, and patient outcomes were analyzed. Multivariable analysis of log length of stay (LOS) was assessed with adjustment for clinical and operative factors. RESULTS: 235 patients underwent open ventral hernia repair. 179 patients were admitted to surgical units, 33 non-surgical units, and 23 stayed on both units. Clinical characteristics including patient age, gender, BMI, and medical comorbidities were similar between patients boarded on surgical versus non-surgical units. Hernia, wound, and operative data were also statistically similar. Patients admitted to non-surgical units for any duration experienced longer hospital stay (4 vs. 6 days, p < 0.001). Patients housed on a non-surgical unit were more likely to transfer rooms than patients on surgical units, 42.9% vs. 10.1% (p < 0.001), respectively. Multivariable analysis of natural log-transformed LOS showed any stay on a non-surgical unit increased LOS by 1.0 days (95% Cl 0.9C1.2 days, p = 0.026). There were no differences in ICU or PACU stay, cost, or postoperative complications in patients housed on surgical versus non-surgical units. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative surgical patients had an increased length of stay when admitted to non-surgical units. More frequent room transfers occurred in patients admitted to non-surgical units.

Activated DCs efficiently enhance antitumor effects mediated by natural killer cells and T lymphocytes. Conversely, tolerogenic DCs essentially contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, DCs can profoundly influence tumor progression and clinical outcome of tumor patients. To gain novel insights into the role of human DCs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we explored the frequency, spatial organization, and clinical significance of conventional DCs type 1 (cDC1s) and type 2 (cDC2s) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in primary PDAC tissues. A higher density of whole tumor area (WTA)- and tumor stroma (TS)-infiltrating cDC1s was significantly associated with better disease-free survival (DFS). In addition, an increased frequency of intraepithelial tumor-infiltrating cDC2s was linked to better DFS and overall survival (OS). Furthermore, an increased density of WTA- and TS-infiltrating pDCs tended to improve DFS. Moreover, a higher frequency of WTA- and TS-infiltrating cDC1s and pDCs emerged as an independent prognostic factor for better DFS and OS. These findings indicate that tumor-infiltrating DCs can significantly influence the clinical outcome of PDAC patients and may contribute to the design of novel treatment options that target PDAC-infiltrating DCs.","output":"Clinical Significance of Tumor-Infiltrating Conventional and Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Administration of heroin results in the engagement of multiple brain regions and the rewarding and addictive effects are mediated, at least partially, through activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, less is known about dopamine system function following chronic exposure to heroin. Withdrawal from chronic heroin exposure is likely to drive a state of low dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as previously observed during withdrawal from other drug classes. Thus, we aimed to investigate alterations in NAc dopamine terminal function following chronic heroin self-administration to identify a mechanism for dopaminergic adaptations. Adult male Long Evans rats were trained to self-administer heroin (0.05 mg/kg/inf, IV) and then placed on a long access (FR1, 6-hrs, unlimited inf, 0.05 mg/kg/inf) protocol to induce escalation of intake. After one day of withdrawal, male rats exhibited lower basal extracellular levels of dopamine as well as reduced dopaminergic responses to a heroin challenge (0.1 mg/kg/inf, IV). Following heroin self-administration, rats had decreased basal extracellular levels of dopamine and blunted dopamine response following a heroin challenge (0.1 mg/kg/inf, IV) in the NAc compared to saline controls. FSCV revealed that heroin-exposed rats have reduced stimulated dopamine release during tonic-like, single-pulse stimulations but increased phasic-like dopamine release during multi-pulse stimulation trains (5 pulses, 5-100Hz) in addition to an altered dynamic range of release stimulation intensities when compared to controls. Further, we found that presynaptic D3 autoreceptor and kappa-opioid receptor activity was increased following heroin self-administration. These results reveal a marked low dopamine state following heroin-exposure and suggest the combination of altered dopamine release dynamics may contribute to increased heroin seeking.","output":"Heroin Self-Administration Induces Altered Dopamine Terminal Dynamics in the Nucleus Accumbens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer pain was observed in 131 of 160 patients with advanced cancer living at home.

They can lead to serious infections, and these children may require treatment in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). This prospective study evaluated the epidemiology of respiratory viruses and associated illnesses among children hospitalized in a PICU during the three winter months of 2012C2013. METHODS: All the children admitted to the PICU, University Hospital of Caen, France, were included. Nasal swabs were collected and specimens were tested using a single real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Of the 105 patients admitted to the PICU during the study period, 84 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The respiratory group included 37 patients with respiratory symptoms at admission while the nonrespiratory group included 47 patients with no respiratory symptoms. The 84 nasal swabs collected included 54 that were considered positive (64.3%) and 70 viruses were detected. The most commonly detected virus was RSV (n = 28; 40.0% positive samples), followed by HRV (n = 24; 34.3%). Viruses were more frequently detected in the respiratory (86.5%) than in the nonrespiratory (42.6%) group (P < 0.001). Statistical analysis by subgroups revealed that RSV infections were significantly more frequent in the respiratory group (54.1%) than in the nonrespiratory group (6.4%) (P < 0.001). There was no difference for HRV (32.4% and 27.7%) or for the other viruses. No difference in duration of hospitalization or duration of mechanical ventilation was demonstrated depending on the virus detected. DISCUSSION: The use of the very sensitive multiplex PCR technique increased virus detection rates in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects.

Diagnostics is one area where biotechnology has been critical. Diagnostic tests play a vital role in managing a viral threat by facilitating the detection of infected and/or recovered individuals. From the perspective of what information is provided, these tests fall into two major categories, molecular and serological. Molecular diagnostic techniques assay whether a virus is present in a biological sample, thus making it possible to identify individuals who are currently infected. Additionally, when the immune system is exposed to a virus, it responds by producing antibodies specific to the virus. Serological tests make it possible to identify individuals who have mounted an immune response to a virus of interest and therefore facilitate the identification of individuals who have previously encountered the virus. These two categories of tests provide different perspectives valuable to understanding the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Based on historical household survey samples, we first establish a computational graph-based discrete choice model to estimate the baseline travel tour parameters before the pandemic. To further capture structural deviations of activity chain patterns from day-by-day time series, we define the activity-oriented deviation parameters within an interpretable utility-based nested logit model framework, which are further estimated through a constrained optimization problem. By incorporating the long short-term memory method as the explainable module to capture the complex periodic and trend information before and after interventions, we predict day-to-day activity chain patterns with more accuracy. The performance of our model is examined based on publicly available datasets such as the 2017 National Household Travel Survey in the United States and the Google Global Mobility Dataset throughout the epidemic period.

METHODS: We developed a virtual pediatric boot camp elective for fourth-year medical students pursuing pediatric residency using Kerns six steps of curriculum development. The two-week virtual elective consisted of facilitated video conferences and small group discussions led by two senior pediatric residents. Semi-structured focus groups were conducted after elective completion. Using SDT as our conceptual framework, we explored participants experience with the near-peer facilitation of the boot camp. Focus group recordings were transcribed and thematically analyzed using deductive coding for SDT, with inductive coding for themes outside the theorys scope. Saturation was reached after three focus groups. The codebook was iteratively revised through peer debriefing between coders and reviewed by other authors. Credibility was established through member checking. RESULTS: Ninety-two percent of eligible medical students (n = 23/25) participated in the boot camp with attendance ranging from 18C21 students per session. Twelve students (52%) participated in three focus groups. Qualitative analysis identified five major themes. Four themes consistent with SDT emerged: competence, autonomy, relatedness to near-peers, and relatedness to specialty/institution.

In preparation for possible Phase I human clinical trials, the current study describes the maximum-tolerated-dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of CMC 2.24 in the rat model. Methods: For the MTD study, 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed into 5 groups (3M/3F per group): Placebo (vehicle; carboxymethylcellulose) and CMC 2.24 at various doses (50, 100, 500, 1000 mg/kg/day), were administered once daily by oral gavage for 5 days. For the PK study, 24 rats were administered either Placebo or CMC 2.24 (100mg/kg/day) once daily for 28 days or only once (500 or 1000 mg/kg). Analysis of this test compound was done using LC/MS/MS for PK evaluation on blood samples drawn from rats at multiple time points. The animals were sacrificed after 5 or 28 days of treatment, and blood chemistry and serology were analyzed. Major organs (heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, brain) were histologically examined at necropsy. Results: Orally administered, CMC 2.24 did not produce significant changes in body weight, food consumption or adverse events in the MTD and toxicology studies. Moreover, no obvious pathologic changes were observed based on histology, hematology, serum biochemistry, or necropsy compared to placebo-treated controls.

Moderation analyses revealed that suppression was related to lower life satisfaction and less social support among Germans, but not among HKC nor Japanese. Social support completely mediated the negative relationship between suppression and life satisfaction among Germans. Furthermore, for Germans and HKC, social support partially mediated the positive relationship between reappraisal and life satisfaction, and the negative relationship between rumination and life satisfaction.

Therefore, Bangladesh Endocrine Society has formulated some practical recommendations for management of diabetes and other endocrine diseases in patients with COVID-19 for use in both primary and specialist care settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the article is to develop a guideline to protect the vulnerable group with utmost preference C the elderly and those with comorbid conditions. Therefore, to ensure the adequate protective measures and timely treatment for COVID-19 patients with diabetes, other endocrine diseases or any other comorbidities. CONSIDERING AND MONITORING ISSUES: The risk of a fatal outcome from COVID-19 may be up to 50% higher in patients with diabetes than in non-diabetics. Patients with diabetes and COVID had CFR 7.3C9.2%, compared with 0.9C1.4% in patients without comorbidities. Diabetic ketoacidosis may be one of the causes of mortality in COVID-19. There is wide fluctuation of blood glucose in these patients, probably due to irregular diet, reduced exercise, increased glucocorticoids secretion, and use of glucocorticoids. HbA1c should be <7.0% for the majority of the patients, this target may be relaxed in appropriate clinical settings. More emphasis should be given on day-to-day blood glucose levels. Hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol/l) must be avoided. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is needed in critically ill patients. CONCLUSION: The fight against COVID-19 has been proven to be a challenging one.

Although airborne spread through infectious respiratory droplets is the primary source of transmission, recent literature has suggested the ocular surface may be able to harbor viral particles. Here, we aim to discuss how SARS-CoV-2 affects the ocular surface and updated guidance on how SARS-CoV-2 transmission should be considered in the setting of eye banking and corneal transplantation procedures. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found on the ocular surface, which may suggest the eye as a site of viral replication. However, there is poor correlation between PCR positivity on the ocular surface and ocular symptoms. To date, although viral particles can be found on the ocular surface, use of standard antiseptic procedures during corneal tissue procurement appears to sufficiently reduce viral load. In addition, preprocedure testing may further decrease the chances of transplanting an infected cornea without significantly impacting the overall accessibility to corneal tissue by decreasing the donor pool. SUMMARY: Corneal transplantation remains a well tolerated and highly successful procedure with no evidence of viral transmission with transplantation.

In the summer of 2017, the North Clear Creek Water Treatment Plant (NCCWTP) began AMD water treatment. To predict and characterize the biological recovery of NFCC to improvements in water quality, we conducted stream mesocosm and field experiments, as well as biomonitoring of benthic communities using a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) study design.

Benthic algal biomass increased at impacted sites and macroinvertebrate surveys showed significant increases in abundance, taxa richness, and emerging adult aquatic insects. However, the dominant taxa colonizing downstream segments of NFCC differed considerably from those predicted based on previous field and experimental results. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is the result of differences in metal exposure regimes observed between our field and mesocosm approaches (i.e., fluctuating vs stable), colonization attributes (i.e., open vs closed system), and spatiotemporal differences in metal sensitivity due to macroinvertebrate phenology.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) decreases the number of treatments compared to conventionally fractionated radiation; hence, it has the potential to decrease treatment delays and non-completion. This study sought to determine the incidence of treatment delay and characterize the etiology and length in a large cohort of men treated with SBRT for their prostate cancer. METHODS: One thousand three hundred and thirty-six patients treated with SBRT from 2008 to 2021 at the Georgetown University Hospital for prostate cancer were included in this retrospective study. A treatment delay was defined as a patient requiring longer than 14 days to complete 5 fractions of SBRT. Non-completion was defined as patients treated with less than 5 fractions. In the patients who experienced delays, chart review was performed to characterize the length and etiology of each delay. Multivariate analysis was performed via binary logistic regression modeling on PSPP. RESULTS: All individuals in the cohort eventually completed the planned 5-fraction regimen. Thirty-three patients experienced a treatment delay. Median length of time to complete treatment was 11 days (range 5C155 days). In patients who experienced a delay, nearly half (45.5%) experienced only a one-day delay. The most common reason for a delay was a technical issue (48.5%), including the machine maintenance, fiducial misalignment, or inadequate pretreatment bowel preparation. Other reasons included unplanned breaks due to acute side effects (21.2%), logistical issues (18.2%), non-treatment related health issues (9.1%), and inclement weather (3.0%).

Youth exposed to multiple traumas (eg, abuse, domestic violence) are at particular risk of developing PTSD. Cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD), derived from adult work, is a theoretically informed, disorder-specific form of trauma-focused cognitiveCbehavioural therapy. While efficacious for child and adolescent single-event trauma samples, its effectiveness in routine settings with more complex, multiple trauma-exposed youth has not been established. The Delivery of Cognitive Therapy for Young People after Trauma randomised controlled trial (RCT) examines the effectiveness of CT-PTSD for treating PTSD following multiple trauma exposure in children and young people in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol describes a two-arm, patient-level, single blind, superiority RCT comparing CT-PTSD (n=60) with TAU (n=60) in children and young people aged 8C17 years with a diagnosis of PTSD following multiple trauma exposure. The primary outcome is PTSD severity assessed using the Childrens Revised Impact of Event Scale (8-item version) at post-treatment (ie, approximately 5 months post-randomisation). Secondary outcomes include structured interview assessment for PTSD, complex PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety, overall functioning and parent-rated mental health. Mid-treatment and 11-month and 29-month post-randomisation assessments will also be completed. ProcessCoutcome evaluation will consider which mechanisms underpin or moderate recovery. Qualitative interviews with the young people, their families and their therapists will be undertaken. Cost-effectiveness of CT-PTSD relative to TAU will be also be assessed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial protocol has been approved by a UK Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee (East of EnglandCCambridge South, 16/EE/0233). Findings will be disseminated broadly via peer-reviewed empirical journal articles, conference presentations and clinical workshops. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN12077707. Registered 24 October 2016 (http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12077707). Trial recruitment commenced on 1 February 2017.

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a condition caused by SARS-CoV-2, results in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with high mortality in the elderly and in people with underlying comorbidities. Results from several studies suggest that CoVs localize in mitochondria and interact with mitochondrial protein translocation machinery to target their encoded products to mitochondria. Coronaviruses encode a number of proteins; this process is essential for viral replication through inhibiting degradation of viral proteins and host misfolded proteins including those in mitochondria. These viruses seem to maintain their replication by altering mitochondrial dynamics and targeting mitochondrial-associated antiviral signaling (MAVS), allowing them to evade host innate immunity. Coronaviruses infections such as COVID-19 are more severe in aging patients. Since endogenous melatonin levels are often dramatically reduced in the aged and because it is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, melatonin has been proposed to be useful in CoVs infections by altering proteasomal and mitochondrial activities. Melatonin inhibits mitochondrial fission due to its antioxidant and inhibitory effects on cytosolic calcium overload. The collective data suggests that melatonin may mediate mitochondrial adaptations through regulating both mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis. We propose that melatonin may inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damage by regulating mitochondrial physiology.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses negatively influence mitochondrial quality control: beneficial effects of melatonin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) belongs to the family of deubiquitinases that can rescue protein targets from proteasomal degradation by reversing their ubiquitination. In various cancers, including prostate cancer and ovarian carcinoma, upregulation of USP2 leads to an increase in the levels of deubiquitinated substrates such as fatty acid synthase, MDM2, cyclin D1 and Aurora-A. USP2 thus plays a critical role in tumor cells survival and therefore represents a therapeutic target. Here a leukemia drug, 6-thioguanine, was found to be a potent inhibitor of USP2. Enzyme-kinetic and X-ray crystallographic data suggest that 6-thioguanine displays a noncompetitive and slow-binding inhibitory mechanism against USP2.

METHODS Six subjects with chronic incomplete SCI (>12 months post injury) participated in this crossover study. Intervention consisted of 3 sessions, separated by at least 1 week, in which each subject received the conditions cathodal, anodal, and sham tsDCS. Stimulation was delivered at 2.5 mA for 20 minutes with the active electrode positioned over the spinous processes of T10-T11 and the reference electrode over left deltoid. To measure the effects of tsDCS on corticospinal excitability, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from transcranial magnetic stimulation were measured bilaterally from soleus before and after tsDCS. RESULTS Five subjects completed all 3 sessions. One subject withdrew after 2 sessions due to complications unrelated to the study. MEPs were measurable in 5 subjects. No significant differences in change of MEP amplitudes were found between the 3 conditions. However, there were trends that indicated laterality of response, particularly with cathodal tsDCS increasing corticospinal excitability contralateral to the reference electrode and decreasing corticospinal excitability ipsilateral to the reference electrode. CONCLUSION Corticospinal excitability may be modulated with laterality by tsDCS in individuals with chronic, incomplete SCI. Further research is needed to 1) determine whether different placement of the reference electrode can lead to uniform modulation bilaterally, and 2) reveal whether these alterations in corticospinal excitability can lead to improved movement function in individuals with chronic, incomplete SCI.","output":"The effect of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation on corticospinal excitability in chronic incomplete spinal cord injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The University of North Dakota's comprehensive approach aims to boost American Indian representation in medicine and public health.","output":"American Indians' Growing Presence In The Health Professions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of COVID-19 forced trainee teachers from the United Arab Emirates to have virtual field experiences in the field of early childhood education.

As an act of remembering the victims, Mexican journalists, writers, and activists created a digital altar: 72 Migrantes. Focusing on photography and narrative as visual frames of Blackness, this article analyzes the representation of Black bodies in the digital altar to conceptualize Blackness as: a constitutive part of violent landscapes;a symptom and supplement of that violence;and, conversely, the location itself from which to critique that violence. At stake is a call for Blackness to be read within hemispheric Latin Americanist visual studies as a locus for understanding antisociality and critical race theory by closely studying the role of the human, social death, and the aesthetics of remembrance. Over 10 years after the massacre, the arguments raised in this article both implicitly and explicitly underscore the need to conceptualize contemporary Blackness and death in the wake of the growing anti-racism activism, Black Lives Matter, and the disproportionate number of people of color who have died as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to some scientists, business people, and politicians, this situation is a forerunner and warning for humanity to change its lifestyle by focusing on sustainable measures to prevent natural ecosystems damage. In line with this, the present review article focused on the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on horticultural production and some prevention measures. It has been scientifically confirmed that the postharvest losses of fruits and vegetables reach around 10-15% in developed countries and about 20-40% in developing countries, higher in some specific crops. It is believed that reducing these losses can help the world fight food supply shocks during the COVID-19 pandemic and customary conditions to reduce the pressure on natural resources.

Governments strive to balance this loop by adopting a set of policies, of which social distancing has left a tremendous negative impact on the global economy. The side effects of this policy are highlighted in three categories: short-term, midterm, and long-term by explaining the reinforcing loops that require time to get stimulated. The short-term loops result in demand and supply shocks in any economy, and if this policy stays effective for a longer period, the midterm loops get activated, leading to corporate and government debt crises. When the pandemic duration extends, the long-term side effects appear with a deflationary recession and a banking crisis. The quickness of moving from one category to another in an economy depends on the financial strength of firms and their government.

It is disappointing that there are no specific drugs until now. The combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medication seems to be the current more effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients in China. In this review, we mainly discussed the relationship between COVID-19 and gut microbiota (GM), as well as the possible impact of TCM combined with western medication on GM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, aiming to provide references for the possible role of GM in TCM against COVID-19. The available data suggest that GM dysbiosis did occur in COVID-19 patients, and the intervention of GM could ameliorate the clinical condition of COVID-19 patients. In addition, TCMs (e.g., Jinhua Qinggan granule, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Qingfei Paidu decoction, Shufeng Jiedu capsule, Qingjin Jianghuo decoction, Toujie Quwen granules, and MaxingShigan) have been proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19 in Chinese clinic. Among them, Ephedra sinica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Bupleurum chinense, Lonicera japonica,Scutellaria baicalensi, and Astragalus membranaceus are common herbs and have a certain regulation on GM, immunity, and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Data were collected prospectively and analyzed with SPSS 21.0. RESULTS 12 patients were included. 50 % were male and 50 % were female with a mean age of 59  10 years old. The median of comorbidities was 7 according to the Charlson Age Comorbidity Index. The 75 % of the tumors were metastases, most of them from colorectal cancer. Most of the patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in 58 % preoperative portal embolization was performed. Major hepatectomies were performed (66.7 % extended right hepatectomy, 33.3 % left extended hepatectomy). The 83.3 % of the patients needed vascular reconstruction.

With hopes for release of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine underway, understanding parental perception of vaccines is important to design successful vaccination interventions. METHODS: A web-based, cross-sectional survey was administered to approximately 900 parents in Johnson County, Kansas during the summer of 2020. Pearson chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were utilized to assess the attitudes of Kansas parents towards a potential addition of the influenza vaccine to the required list for K-12 students and furthermore, their general perception of vaccinations, and the impact of COVID-19 on those beliefs. RESULTS: A total of 179 parents responded. Fifty-one percent (n = 92) were in favor of adding the influenza vaccine to the mandatory list (Pro-Addition). Anti-Addition parents had significantly higher levels of distrust (2.1, p < 0.001) and were significantly more concerned about vaccine adverse effects. When presented with a hypothetical situation in which a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine was available, 24% of Anti-Addition parents indicated they would receive the vaccine or obtain it for their children (21 people, p < 0.001).

It is classified as an interstitial idiopathic pneumonia (IIP) according to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). Secondary organizing pneumonia has a known triggering mechanism, such as infectious agents, certain medications, or concomitant symptoms of other primary pulmonary diseases and diseases of other organ systems.

METHODS: 114 female adult participants with a current (53.5%) or past (46.5%) full or partial AN syndrome diagnosis completed an online survey which included functional milestone questions, the EDFLIX, WSAS, EDE-Q, and DASS-21. RESULTS: Everyday flexibility scores were significantly associated with WSAS scores, but not functional milestones for the same domain. Lower flexibility was related to higher WSAS work impairment but was not associated with poor occupational outcomes. Lower flexibility was related to higher WSAS social impairment but was not associated with less frequent social contact with friends. Milestones across work, social and relationship areas were not significantly correlated, suggesting individuals have areas of strength and weakness across functional domains.

These problems have triggered severe criticism toward the institutions and highlighted a stark contrast compared to Britain's vaccination campaign, which, at the beginning of 2021, was one of the fastest in the continent. In the ensuing debate between the EU and the UK on their uneven vaccination rates, the Brexit argument has been repeatedly invoked: Some political commentators have argued that the reason why COVID-19 vaccination campaign could run so smoothly in Britain is that the country was not held back by the EU's slow approval process. This paper observes the way in which Britain emphasized its blistering vaccination pace to deflect criticism against Brexit. From a discursive perspective, Britain's vaccine success was used to vindicate the Brexit project, providing a new argument in favour of its indispensable and timely nature. At the other end of a binary rhetoric, the EU officials attempted to shatter confidence in the 'British vaccine', while also depositing blame on other factors triggering the EU's delay, such as the shortage of pharmaceutical supplies. The analytical part of this paper foregrounds strategies of discursive legitimation to observe how, and to what extent, the Brexit debate is being reshaped in UK and EU media by looking at a corpus of political tweets. The rhetorical strategies adopted by UK political leaders and EU officials to (de)legitimise national and supranational choices with reference to the COVID-19 vaccination campaign are observed through the lens of Critical Discourse Analysis as it embraces the idea that discursive acts are in dialectical relation to the social and institutional structures in which they are framed.","output":"Vaccine Nationalism or 'Brexit Dividend'?

A new strategy involves the intradermal administration of heterologous vaccines composed of one or two doses of inactivated vaccine and a booster dose with the mutated S1 protein (K-S). Such vaccines improve the immune efficacy by increasing the neutralizing antibody titers and promoting specific T cell responses against five variants of the RBD protein. A viral challenge test with the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant confirmed that both administration schedules (i.e. 1 + 1 and 2 + 1) ensured protection against this strain. These results suggest that the aforementioned strategy is effective for protecting against new variants and enhances the anamnestic immune response in the immunized population.","output":"Preclinical immunological evaluation of an intradermal heterologous vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In this study, the authors applied evidence-based medicine to decrease the utilization of routine chest radiography in adult intensive care units and used time-driven activity-based costing to demonstrate cost savings. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team was formed with representatives from radiology, surgery, internal medicine, and nursing. The process of performing a portable chest radiographic examination was mapped, and time trials were performed by the radiology technologists and radiology resident. This information was used to determine the cost of performing portable intensive care unit (ICU) chest radiographic studies. The clinical team changed resident education, ordering protocols, and workflows to discontinue the use of routine daily chest radiography, emphasizing that it should be ordered only in specific situations, such as on admission or after central line placement. In addition, as a balancing measure, the team tracked complications such as unplanned extubations and ventilator days. RESULTS: Changing ordering practices in the adult ICUs to align with established evidence-based guidelines resulted in a 37% decrease in the utilization of portable chest radiography between June and December, without a concomitant increase in unplanned extubations or ventilator days. In addition, a proportionate cost savings was realized, as demonstrated by the application of time-driven activity-based costing. CONCLUSIONS: This performance improvement initiative successfully increased the value of care delivered to ICU patients by aligning institutional clinical practice with evidence-based medicine. This resulted in decreased utilization and the cost associated with delivering care without a concomitant increase in complications.","output":"Restricting Daily Chest Radiography in the Intensive Care Unit: Implementing Evidence-Based Medicine to Decrease Utilization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With over 64 1 million cases worldwide (by December 1, 2020) and a death toll surpassing 1 48 million the COVID-19 pandemics has filled not only with fear and isolation our day-to-day lives but also with a significant amount of disinformation, the unreliability of data, and lack of trust on the response of governmental officers and authorities that, sadly, can be translated in loss of lives in our closest circles (colleagues, friends, family) At Air, Soil and Water Research (ASW), we believe that knowledge is the only way out of this and any other crisis faced by humankind, and our team has been working elbow-to-elbow (but online) to offer the best quality research and scientific knowledge that will certainly assist for better decision making and led towards the best path to get us through this so hard time ?

We assessed the inter-/intra-rate reviewer reliability of two scales: the Oral Secretion Scale (OSS), specifically developed for ALS patients, and the Sialorrhea Scoring Scale (SSS), initially developed for Parkinson's disease patients. Sialorrhea was rated in 69 ALS consecutive patients by four evaluators: two neurologists, one nurse and one speech therapist. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated by the light kappa coefficient and intra-rater reliability by the weighted kappa coefficient. We also compared patients' and caregivers' answers. Results demonstrated that the two scales present a high inter-/intra-rater reliability: weighted kappas were 0.85 for both scales and light kappas 0.89 for the OSS and 0.88 for the SSS. Both scales also showed a good intra-profession reliability (OSS kappa = 0.84; SSS kappa = 0.79) and agreement between patients' and caregivers' answers. The SSS showed a higher responsiveness compared to OSS. In conclusion, both Oral Secretion Scale and Sialorrhea Scoring Scale are reliable tools to measure sialorrhea in ALS patients.

OBJECTIVES: To collect data about the impact of COVID-19 emergency on access to care for PwMS and on MS treatment practices. METHODS: Between March and July 2020, the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) promoted an online survey covering patient access to care, management of relapses and visits, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and experience with COVID-19. RESULTS: Three-hundred and sixty neurologists from 52 countries (68% from Europe) completed the survey. 98% reported COVID-19-related restrictions. Telemedicine was adopted to overcome the limited access to care and was newly activated (73%) or widely implemented (17%). 70% reported changes in DMT management. Interferons and glatiramer were considered safe. Dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide and fingolimod were considered safe except for patients developing lymphopenia.

C-aAbs against IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IFN, IFN and GM-CSF were measured in 131 HSCT recipients before and after (days + 7, + 14, + 28) HSCT and tested for associations with 33 different plasma biomarkers, leukocyte subsets, platelets and clinical outcomes, including engraftment, GvHD and infections.

Both patients with stable and those with acquired high-titre c-aAb levels displayed significant differences in biomarker concentrations and blood cell counts pre-HSCT and at day 28, and the trajectories of these variables varied over the course of HSCT. No clinical outcomes were associated with high-titre c-aAbs. In this first study of c-aAbs in HSCT patients, we demonstrated that high-titre levels of c-aAb may both persist and emerge in patients over the course of HSCT and may be associated with altered immune biomarkers and cell profiles.","output":"Cytokine autoantibodies are stable throughout the haematopoietic stem cell transplantation course and are associated with distinct biomarker and blood cell profiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we describe how murine basophils can be detected in vivo by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining.

The key mechanism stems from heterogeneous risk tolerance: as a recessionary shock hits the economy and brings down asset prices, risk-tolerant agents' wealth share declines and their leverage rises endogenously. This reduces the market's risk tolerance and generates downward pressure on asset prices and aggregate demand. When monetary policy is unconstrained, it can offset the decline in risk tolerance with an interest rate cut that boosts the market's Sharpe ratio. However, if the interest rate policy is constrained, new contractionary feedbacks arise: recessionary shocks lead to further asset price and output drops, which feed the risk-off episode and trigger a downward loop. In this context, LSAPs improve asset prices and aggregate demand by transferring risk to the government's balance sheet, which reduces the market's required Sharpe ratio and reverses the contractionary feedbacks. Quantitatively, we show that aggregate shocks and LSAPs have large impacts on asset prices when the model is calibrated to fit the inelastic demand for aggregate assets uncovered in recent literature. We also show that heterogeneity in risk tolerance explains part of the demand inelasticity in normal times, and further reduces the elasticity after a recessionary shock. The COVID-19 shock and the large response by all major central banks provide a vivid illustration of the environment we seek to capture.","output":"A Model of Endogenous Risk Intolerance and LSAPs: Asset Prices and Aggregate Demand in a 'COVID-19' Shock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the major respiratory viral threats for chickens. Despite the intensive application of IBV vaccines, several outbreaks have been reported worldwide. Here, we report several IBV outbreaks in thirteen poultry farms in Eastern Saudi Arabia (ESA) from 2013 to 2014. The main goals of the current study were as follows: (1) isolation and molecular characterization of the currently circulating strains in ESA (Al-Hasa, Dammam, and Buqayq) and (2) evaluation of the immune status of these birds to IBV. To achieve our goals, tissue specimens (trachea, lungs, liver, kidney and cecal tonsils) and sera were collected. High morbidity up to 100% and mortality ranging from 18 to 90% were reported. Severe infection was observed in the trachea, bronchi, and kidneys of the infected birds. IBV strains were isolated using embryonated chicken eggs. The isolated viruses induced hemorrhage, dwarfing and death of the inoculated embryos 3C5 days post-infection. The circulating IBV strains were identified by sequencing the partial IBV-N and IBV-S1 genes. These viruses showed 95% sequence identity to Indian, Italian, Egyptian and Chinese strains and were quite distinct from the locally used vaccines on the genomic level. Interestingly, high antibody titers against IBV were reported in some of these farms, suggesting the presence of new virulent strains in ESA. The seroconversion of infected birds was reported among the affected flocks. In conclusion, very virulent IBV strains are currently circulating in ESA. Further studies are currently in progress to molecularly characterize these IBV strains.

Methods: We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slopes and plots. Findings: The final model included age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and SpO2 as independent predictors of mortality. Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0.89) and external (c=0.98) validation. Internal calibration was excellent (calibration slope=1). External validation showed some over-prediction of risk in low-risk individuals and under-prediction of risk in high-risk individuals prior to recalibration. Recalibration of the intercept and slope led to excellent performance of the model in independent data.

COVID-19 is associated with viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome causing significant morbidity and mortality. The proposed treatments for COVID-19 have shown little or no effect in the clinic so far. Additionally, bacterial and fungal pathogens contribute to the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pneumonia disease complex. The antibiotic resistance in pneumonia treatment is increasing at an alarming rate. Therefore, carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), such as fullerene, carbon dots, graphene, and their derivatives constitute a promising alternative due to their wide-spectrum antimicrobial activity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and capacity to induce tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the antimicrobial mode of action is mainly physical (e.g., membrane distortion), characterized by a low risk of antimicrobial resistance. In this Review, we evaluated the literature on the antiviral activity and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of CBNs. CBNs had antiviral activity against 13 enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. CBNs with low or no toxicity to humans are promising therapeutics against the COVID-19 pneumonia complex with other viruses, bacteria, and fungi, including those that are multidrug-resistant.","output":"Carbon-Based Nanomaterials: Promising Antiviral Agents to Combat COVID-19 in the Microbial-Resistant Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? Lactate is considered an important substrate for mitochondria in the muscles, heart and brain during exercise and is the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys. In this light, we review the (patho)physiology of lactate metabolism in sepsis and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19). What advances does it highlight? Elevated blood lactate is strongly associated with mortality in septic patients. Lactate seems unrelated to tissue hypoxia but is likely to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction and high adrenergic stimulation. Patients with severe COVID\\\\19 exhibit near\\\\normal blood lactate, indicating preserved mitochondrial function, despite a systemic hyperinflammatory state similar to sepsis. ABSTRACT: In critically ill patients, elevated plasma lactate is often interpreted as a sign of organ hypoperfusion and/or tissue hypoxia. This view on lactate is likely to have been influenced by the pioneering exercise physiologists around 1920. August Krogh identified an oxygen deficit at the onset of exercise that was later related to an oxygen debt and lactate accumulation by A. V. Hill. Lactate is considered to be the main gluconeogenetic precursor in the liver and kidneys during submaximal exercise, but hepatic elimination is attenuated by splanchnic vasoconstriction during high\\\\intensity exercise, causing an exponential increase in blood lactate. With the development of stable isotope tracers, lactate has become established as an important energy source for muscle, brain and heart tissue, where it is used for mitochondrial respiration. Plasma lactate > 4 mM is strongly associated with mortality in septic shock, with no direct link between lactate release and tissue hypoxia. Herein, we provide evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction and adrenergic stimulation as explanations for the sepsis\\\\induced hyperlactataemia. Despite profound hypoxaemia and intense work of breathing, patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) rarely exhibit hyperlactataemia (> 2.5 mM), while presenting a systemic hyperinflammatory state much like sepsis. However, lactate dehydrogenase, which controls the formation of lactate, is markedly elevated in plasma and strongly associated with mortality in severe COVID\\\\19. We briefly review the potential mechanisms of the lactate dehydrogenase elevation in COVID\\\\19 and its relationship to lactate metabolism based on mechanisms established in contracting skeletal muscle and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.","output":"The role of lactate in sepsis and COVID\\\\19: Perspective from contracting skeletal muscle metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. This study aims to explore the relationship between key natural and social factors and the transmission of COVID-19 in China. Methods This study collected the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 21 provinces and cities in China as of February 28, 2020. Three provinces were included in the sample: Hainan, Guizhou, and Qinghai. The 18 cities included Shanghai, Tianjin and so on. Key natural factors comprised monthly average temperatures in the January and February 2020 and spatial location as determined by longitude and latitude. Social factors were population density, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), number of medical institutions and health practitioners;as well as the per capita values for GDP, medical institutions, and health practitioners. Excel was used to collate the data and draw the temporal and spatial distribution map of the prevalence rate (PR) and the proportion of local infection (PLI). The influencing factors were analyzed by SPSS 21.0 statistical software, and the relationship between the dependent and independent variables was simulated by 11 models. Finally, we choose the exponential model according to the value of R 2 and the applicability of the model. Results The temporal and spatial distribution of the PR varies across the 21 provinces and cities identified. The PR generally decreases with distance from Hubei, except in the case of Shenzhen City, where the converse is observed. The results of the exponential model simulation show that the monthly minimum, median, and maximum average temperatures in January and February, and the latitude and population density are significant and thus will affect the PLI. The corresponding values of R 2 are 0.297, 0.322, 0.349, 0.290, 0.314, 0.339, 0.344, and 0.301. The effects of other factors were not statistically significant. Conclusions Among the selected key natural and social factors, higher temperatures may decrease the transmission of COVID-19. From this analysis, it is evident that if the temperature decreases by 1, the average PLI increases by 0.01. Further, it was established that locations at more northern latitudes had a higher PLI, and population density showed an inverse relationship with PLI.","output":"The relationship between key natural and social factors and the transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an active pandemic that likely poses an existential threat to humanity. Frequent handwashing, social distancing, and partial or total lockdowns are among the suite of measures prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and being implemented across the world to contain the pandemic. However, existing inequalities in access to certain basic necessities of life (water, sanitation facility, and food storage) create layered vulnerabilities to COVID-19 and can render the preventive measures ineffective or simply counterproductive. We hypothesized that individuals in households without any of the named basic necessities of life are more likely to violate the preventive (especially lockdown) measures and thereby increase the risk of infection or aid the spread of COVID-19. Based on nationally-representative data for 25 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, multivariate statistical and geospatial analyses were used to investigate whether, and to what extent, household family structure is associated with in-house access to basic needs which, in turn, could reflect on a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. The results indicate that approximately 46% of the sampled households in these countries (except South Africa) did not have in-house access to any of the three basic needs and about 8% had access to all the three basic needs. Five countries had less than 2% of their households with in-house access to all three basic needs. Ten countries had over 50% of their households with no in-house access to all the three basic needs. There is a social gradient in in-house access between the rich and the poor, urban and rural richest, male- and female-headed households, among others. We conclude that SSA governments would need to infuse innovative gender- and age-sensitive support services (such as water supply, portable sanitation) to augment the preventive measures prescribed by the WHO. Short-, medium- and long-term interventions within and across countries should necessarily address the upstream, midstream and downstream determinants of in-house access and the full spectrum of layers of inequalities including individual, interpersonal, institutional, and population levels.","output":"Disparate on-site access to water, sanitation, and food storage heighten the risk of COVID-19 spread in Sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Baculoviruses are insect pathogens widely used as biotechnological tools in different fields of life sciences and technologies. The particular biology of these entities (biosafety viruses 1; large circular double-stranded DNA genomes, infective per se; generally of narrow host range on insect larvae; many of the latter being pests in agriculture) and the availability of molecular-biology procedures (e.g., genetic engineering to edit their genomes) and cellular resources (availability of cell lines that grow under in vitro culture conditions) have enabled the application of baculoviruses as active ingredients in pest control, as systems for the expression of recombinant proteins (Baculovirus Expression Vector SystemsBEVS) and as viral vectors for gene delivery in mammals or to display antigenic proteins (Baculoviruses applied on mammalsBacMam). Accordingly, BEVS and BacMam technologies have been introduced in academia because of their availability as commercial systems and ease of use and have also reached the human pharmaceutical industry, as incomparable tools in the development of biological products such as diagnostic kits, vaccines, protein therapies, andthough still in the conceptual stage involving animal modelsgene therapies.

In addition, we investigated the time-course expression of fucosyltransferase (FUT) 1C6 genes in GES-1 cells stimulated with H. pylori strains at 0.5C8 h. At 4 h post-infection, Lotus, AAA, BC2LCN, PA-IIL, CNL and ACG lectins had increased signals in H. pylori-infected GES-1 cells compared to uninfected cells. Higher expression of FUT1 and FUT2 was detected in all H. pylori-infected GES-1 cells within 2 h, regardless of the H. pylori strain. In particular, the expression of FUT2 was higher in H. pylori-infected GES-1 cells with a higher fold change in levels of BC2LCN lectin specific to 1-2 linked fucose (Fuc) at 4 h. The results suggest that the high levels of 1, 2-linked Fuc synthesized by FUT1/2, might play a role in the preliminary stage of H. pylori infection.

Most estimates have focused on numbers of deaths, with little direct quantification of years of life lost (YLL) through COVID-19. As most people dying with COVID-19 are older with underlying long-term conditions (LTCs), some have speculated that YLL are low. We aim to estimate YLL attributable to COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number/type of LTCs. Methods: We first estimated YLL from COVID-19 using standard WHO life tables, based on published age/sex data from COVID-19 deaths in Italy. We then used aggregate data on number/type of LTCs to model likely combinations of LTCs among people dying with COVID-19. From these, we used routine UK healthcare data to estimate life expectancy based on age/sex/different combinations of LTCs. We then calculated YLL based on age, sex and type of LTCs and multimorbidity count. Results: Using the standard WHO life tables, YLL per COVID-19 death was 14 for men and 12 for women. After adjustment for number and type of LTCs, the mean YLL was slightly lower, but remained high (13 and 11 years for men and women, respectively). The number and type of LTCs led to wide variability in the estimated YLL at a given age (e.g. at 80 years, YLL was >10 years for people with 0 LTCs, and <3 years for people with 6). Conclusions: Deaths from COVID-19 represent a substantial burden in terms of per-person YLL, more than a decade, even after adjusting for the typical number and type of LTCs found in people dying of COVID-19. The extent of multimorbidity heavily influences the estimated YLL at a given age. More comprehensive and standardised collection of data on LTCs is needed to better understand and quantify the global burden of COVID-19 and to guide policy-making and interventions.","output":"COVID-19 - exploring the implications of long-term condition type and extent of multimorbidity on years of life lost: a modelling study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) causada por la infeccin por el nuevo coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) ha creado una pandemia que ha llevado a una lucha mundial para hacer frente al gran nmero de personas infectadas, muchas de las cuales requieren cuidados intensivos.

The U.S. pandemic strategy myopically considered one objective at a time, with lockdowns that addressed the former, but was detrimental to the latter, and phased reopening that pursued the latter, but lost control over the former. How could we prioritize interventions to simultaneously minimize cases of severe illness and fatalities while reopening? A team of researchers anchored by the Center on Stochastic Modeling, Optimization, & Statistics (COSMOS), The University of Texas at Arlington, has formulated a computationally efficient optimization framework, referred to as COSMOS COVID-19 Linear Programming (CC19LP), to study the delicate balance between the expected fatality rate due to cases of severe illness and the level of normalcy in the community. The key to the CC19LP framework is a focus on key contacts that separate individuals at higher risk from the rest of the population. CC19LP minimizes expected fatalities by optimizing the use of available interventions, namely, COVID-19 testing, personal protective equipment (PPE), COVID-19 vaccines, and social precautions, such as distancing, handwashing, and face coverings. A C3.ai award-winning online CC19LP tool is accessible from the COSMOS COVID-19 project site (https://cosmos.uta.edu/projects/covid-19/) and has been tested for all 3142 U.S. county areas. Results are demonstrated for several metropolitan counties with a deeper investigation for Miami-Dade County in Florida. Note to PractitionersIn this article, a computationally fast optimization framework is presented to study the delicate balance between reopening U.S. communities and controlling severe cases of COVID-19 that lead to hospitalizations and fatalities. This framework can provide guidance to decision-makers on optimal intervention strategies for protecting high-risk individuals while reopening communities. This optimization framework demonstrates a practical approach to conduct decision-making in an uncertain environment and can be useful for the prioritization of resources and interventions in the case of future epidemics or pandemics.

Conservative treatment of an ipsilateral fracture of the distal ulna metaphysis is one of the risk factors for loss of reduction. Percutaneous fixation of the fracture with K-wires is recommended. This study aims to evaluate the outcome of percutaneous fixation of both bones performed as the primary treatment. Materials and Methods: A randomized, open, prospective, clinical trial was conducted, including skeletally immature patients who underwent surgery for fractures of the distal radius and ulna. They were randomized into two groups, one with fixation only of the radius fracture and the other with fixation of both the radius and the ulna fractures, and they were followed clinically and radiologically for up to 12 weeks postoperatively. Results: Sixteen children were selected. In the intraoperative period, fluoroscopy was activated for a longer time when fixing the ulna (p = 0.011) and the surgical time was longer in this group (p = 0.014).

In the United Arab Emirates, telemedicine services are mainly delivered through either integrated hospital outpatient department (OPDs) or community clinics. However, it is unknown if patients perceptions of, and satisfaction with, telemedicine services differ between these two types of health care systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the differences in patients perceptions of, and satisfaction with, telemedicine between hospital OPDs and community clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aimed to identify patient- or visit-related characteristics contributing to patient satisfaction with telemedicine. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study that was conducted at Abu Dhabi health care centers, we invited outpatients aged 18 years or over, who completed a telemedicine visit during the COVID-19 pandemic, to participate in our study. Patients perceptions of, and satisfaction with, telemedicine regarding the two system types (ie, hospital OPDs and community clinics) were assessed using an online survey that was sent as a link through the SMS system. Regression models were used to describe the association between patient- and visit-related characteristics, as well as the perception of, and satisfaction with, telemedicine services. RESULTS: A total of 515 patients participated in this survey. Patients satisfaction with telemedicine services was equally high among the settings, with no statistically significant difference between the two setting types (hospital OPDs: 253/343, 73.8%; community clinics: 114/172, 66.3%; P=.19). Video consultation was significantly associated with increased patient satisfaction (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% CI 1.04-6.33; P=.04) and patients support of the transition to telemedicine use during and after the pandemic (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.18-7.07; P=.02). Patients who used video consultations were more likely to report that telemedicine improved access to health care services (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.71-8.03; P=.02), reduced waiting times and travel costs (OR 4.94, 95% CI 1.15-21.19; P=.03), addressed patients needs (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.13-6.11; P=.03), and eased expression of patients medical concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR 2.19, 95% CI 0.89-5.38; P=.09). Surprisingly, middle-aged patients were two times more likely to be satisfied with telemedicine services (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.09-4.14; P=.03), as compared to any other age group in this study. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patient satisfaction was unaffected by the health system setting in which patients received the teleconsultations, whether they were at hospitals or community clinics. Video consultation was associated with increased patient satisfaction with telemedicine services. Efforts should be focused on strategic planning for enhanced telemedicine services, video consultation in particular, for both emergent circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and day-to-day health care delivery.","output":"Exploring Quality Differences in Telemedicine Between Hospital Outpatient Departments and Community Clinics: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1,4-Dioxane is a persistent and mobile organic chemical that has been found by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to be an unreasonable risk to human health in some occupational contexts. 1,4-Dioxane is released into the environment as industrial waste and occurs in some personal-care products as an unintended byproduct. However, limited exposure assessments have been conducted outside of an occupational context.

This paper aims to carry out a short-term projection of new cases; forecast the maximum number of active cases for India and select high-incidence states; and evaluate the impact of three weeks lock down period using different models. METHODS: We used Logistic growth curve model for short term prediction; SIR models to forecast the cumulative, maximum number of active cases and peak time; and Time Interrupted Regression model to evaluate the impact of lockdown and other interventions. RESULTS: The predicted cumulative number of cases for India was 58,912 (95% CI: 57,960, 59,853) by May 08, 2020 and the observed number of cases was 59,695. The model predicts a cumulative number of 1,02,974 (95% CI: 1,01,987, 1,03,904) cases by May 22, 2020 As per SIR model, the maximum number of active cases is projected to be 57,449 on May 18, 2020. The time interrupted regression model indicates a decrease of 149 daily new cases after the lock down period which is statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: The Logistic growth curve model predicts accurately the short-term scenario for India and high incidence states. The prediction through SIR model may be used for planning and prepare the health systems.

METHODS: The Health Service Executives (HSE) Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) system produced a daily database of COVID-19 discharge episodes from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. This study analysed data on episodes of COVID-19 hospitalisation recorded between February 29 and July 31, 2020. A deterministic record linkage process transformed records from episode to patient level. Logistic regression modelling identified factors associated with long length of stay (LLOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission and inhospital mortality. RESULTS: Median length of stay was 9 days; 12.8% of patients had ICU admission and 16.6% died in hospital. Male patients were more likely to have ICU admission and die in hospital. Likelihood of LLOS and inhospital mortality increased with age. Obesity, hypertension and diabetes were associated with ICU admission while chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with inhospital mortality. Nursing home residents were less likely to be admitted to ICU and more likely to die in hospital compared to patients admitted from home.

Measured Tcr (thermometer pill) and estimated Tcr (ECTempTM Tcr-est) were compared. MAIN RESULTS Measured Tcr either increased to an asymptote Tcr < 39.5C (WARM; n=11), or progressively increased to Tcr > 40.0C (HOT; n=10). In the HOT group, Tcr-est reflected measured Tcr up to Tcr = 40.0C (Bias = -0.10  0.37C, root mean square error = 0.37  0.13C). In the WARM group, Tcr-est overestimated Tcr (Bias = 0.34  0.40C) and was higher from mid-point to end.

Early prediction and intervention of AKI are vital for improving clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. As lack of tools for early AKI detection in COVID-19 patients, this study aimed to validate the USCD-Mayo risk score in predicting hospital-acquired AKI in an extended multi-center COVID-19 cohort. METHODS: Five hundred seventy-two COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Tongji Hospital Guanggu Branch, Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital, and Wuhan No. Ninth Hospital was enrolled for this study. Patients who developed AKI or reached an outcome of recovery or death during the study period were included. Predictors were evaluated according to data extracted from medical records. RESULTS: Of all patients, a total of 44 (8%) developed AKI. The UCSD-Mayo risk score achieved excellent discrimination in predicting AKI with the C-statistic of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.84C0.91). Next, we determined the UCSD-Mayo risk score had good overall performance (Nagelkerke R(2) = 0.32) and calibration in our cohort. Further analysis showed that the UCSD-Mayo risk score performed well in subgroups defined by gender, age, and several chronic comorbidities. However, the discrimination of the UCSD-Mayo risk score in ICU patients and patients with mechanical ventilation was not good which might be resulted from different risk factors of these patients.

Although it is still not fully established if RNA viruses could generate miRNAs that would target their own genes or alter the host gene expression, there are examples of miRNAs functioning as an antiviral defense mechanism. In the case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are several mechanisms that would make miRNAs impact the virus, like interfering with replication, translation and even modulating the host expression. In this study, we performed a machine learning based miRNA prediction analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 genome to identify miRNA-like hairpins and searched for potential miRNA C based interactions between the viral miRNAs and human genes and human miRNAs and viral genes. Our PANTHER gene function analysis results indicate that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription. For instance, a transcriptional regulator, STAT1 and transcription machinery might be targeted by virus-derived miRNAs. In addition, many known human miRNAs appear to be able to target viral genes. Considering the fact that miRNA-based therapies have been successful before, comprehending mode of actions of miRNAs and their possible roles during SARS-CoV-2 infections could create new opportunities for the development and improvement of new therapeutics.","output":"Computational analysis of microRNA-mediated interactions in SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Currently, patients must consult with a primary care practitioner (PCP) prior to being referred to specialist breast services.

RESULTS: 79 responses were received. PCPs estimated that 7.0% (median) of their total consultations were regarding a breast-related issue and that COVID-19 had not had a significant impact on the rate of referral to breast units (P = 0.75). 84.8% of PCPs had a high level of satisfaction with the current referral pathway.

METHODS Representative mesh types for LVHR included one nonabsorbable barrier mesh (Composix) and three absorbable barrier meshes (Sepramesh, Proceed, and Parietex composite). Macroporous polypropylene mesh (Prolite Ultra) served as the control mesh. Three methods of fixation were used, namely, 0-polypropylene suture+FS (ARTISS 4 IU), FS alone (ARTISS), and tacks alone, to secure 34-cm pieces of mesh (10 of each combination) to the peritoneal surface of New Zealand white rabbit abdominal wall. After 2 h of incubation at 37 C, specimens underwent acute testing. Subsequently, a chronic phase was completed using the aforementioned fixation methods (10 of each combination), in which two 44-cm pieces of mesh were secured intraperitoneally in each of 75 New Zealand white rabbits, which survived 8 weeks until they were sacrificed. A transparent grid overlay was used to measure the mesh and adhesion area. Adhesion tenacity was characterized using the Garrard adhesion scale. In both the acute and chronic samples, a 33-cm area of mesh-tissue interface underwent lap shear testing at a rate of 0.42 mm/s using a tensiometer (Instron 5542). The maximum load sustained by the mesh-tissue construct was recorded as the acute fixation strength in newtons (N). Data are given as meansstandard error of the mean. Statistical significance (p<0.05) was determined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) posttest or a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test (adhesion scores). RESULTS The acute fixation strength was significantly greater for all the meshes secured with either suture+FS or tacks alone than for FS alone (p<0.001 for all comparisons). All the meshes except Proceed demonstrated greater acute fixation strength with suture+FS than with tacks alone (p0.016). Composix achieved greater acute fixation with suture+FS than all the other meshes (p0.022). Acute fixation with suture + FS was greater for Parietex Composite and ProLite Ultra than for Proceed (p0.015). When the animals were sacrificed, 48 of 50 meshes fixed with FS alone were insufficiently affixed to the abdominal wall, which may have resulted in hernia recurrence in a hernia model. The chronic fixation strength was greater for all the mesh types with either suture+FS or tacks only than with FS alone (p0.0005). The chronic fixation strength was greater with suture+FS than with tacks for Proceed and ProLite Ultra (p0.013). Neither mesh area nor adhesion tenacity differed significantly with any mesh/fixation method combination. CONCLUSIONS In a chronic rabbit model of LVHR, fixation strength with FS alone was inadequate for selected nonabsorbable and absorbable barrier-coated meshes. The acute and chronic fixation strengths of suture+FS were equivalent or superior to the fixation strength of tacks alone. Using a combination of suture and FS for mesh fixation in LVHR may provide adequate fixation while decreasing postoperative pain due to spiral titanium tacks. In this preclinical series, mesh secured to the peritoneal surface by FS alone may have led to early recurrence.","output":"Evaluation of intraperitoneal placement of absorbable and nonabsorbable barrier coated mesh secured with fibrin sealant in a New Zealand white rabbit model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health research is published at a breathtaking pace and quantity; however, even when research is systematically developed into best practices and/or clinical guidelines, it often is not implemented into practice.

The aim of the study was to analyze the characteristics of the course, prognostically unfavorable factors, and outcome of COVID-19 in HD patients of the second wave of the pandemic. Materials and methods: a retrospective study was carried out on the material of observations of 325 HD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the period from 09/01/2020 to 12/31/2020. The patients' age was 60.114.0 years. The duration of HD treatment was 30.0 (9.5;66.0) months. The endpoint was taken as the discharge from the hospital or death. Results: in 264 out of 325 (81.2%) patients, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. CT scan of the chest showed signs of viral pneumonia in all patients. Mortality was 15.1% (49 out of 325 pts). In 79.7% of patients, the cause of death was ARDS. Comparative analysis showed that patients with a fatal outcome (group 2) were older (69.210.6 years) than patients with a successful course (group 1) of the disease (58.513.9 years), and differed in higher comorbidity index (7.81.9 versus 5.92.2, respectively). SpO2 in groups 2 and 1 was 65.210.1% and 92.16.4%, respectively (p<0.001). In the deceased patients, anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia were significantly more pronounced, as well as indicators of GGT, alkaline phosphatase, ferritin, CRP, LDH, and D-dimer. In the fatal group, the proportion of patients with a procalcitonin level of more than 2 ng/ml was also higher. In multivariate analysis, only high comorbidity index and the need for mechanical ventilation were the independent predictors of the unfavorable outcome. In the group of patients with the favorable outcome, the combined therapy with immunobiological drugs and dexamethasone were used significantly more often than in the deceased group, while the frequency of their isolated use in the compared groups was comparable. Conclusions: COVID-19 in HD patients is characterized by severe course and high mortality. Independent predictors of an unfavorable outcome of the disease were a high comorbidity index and the need for invasive lung ventilation. Early use of immunobiological drugs and dexamethasone in combination with anticoagulants increases the effectiveness of treatment of severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HD patients. ? 2021 JSC Vidal Rus.

From a socio-material perspective that focuses on relationality among bodies and things, the examination of such questions means that we are constantly interrogating what goes on, not only seeking out different potentialities that may emerge in the flow of activity but also acknowledging that particular arrangements of bodies and things may endure and favor the performance and reproduction of established ways of being and doing (Burnett and Merchant, 2018;Burnett et al., 2020) Attention to possibility, multiplicity and emergence are paid mostly in posthumanist, new materialist understandings of literacies, where the human body features as one among many more-than-human agents in intra-actions that produce truths, realities, pieces of knowledge and literacies (Kuby and Gutshall Rucker, 2016).

Despite these risks, there have been no consistent statements on surgical guidelines regarding the perioperative screening or management of COVID-19 patients, and we do not have objective global data that describe the current conditions surrounding this issue. This study aimed to clarify the current global surgical practice including COVID-19 screening, preventive measures and in-hospital infection under the COVID-19 pandemic, and to clarify the international gaps on infection control policies among countries worldwide. Methods: During April 2-8, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey on surgical practice was distributed to surgeons worldwide through international surgical societies, social media and personal contacts. Main outcome and measures included preventive measures and screening policies of COVID-19 in surgical practice and centers' experiences of in-hospital COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed by country's cumulative deaths number by April 8, 2020 (high risk, >5000; intermediate risk, 100-5000; low risk, <100). Results: A total of 936 centers in 71 countries responded to the survey (high risk, 330 centers; intermediate risk, 242 centers; low risk, 364 centers). In the majority (71.9%) of the centers, local guidelines recommended preoperative testing based on symptoms or suspicious radiologic findings. Universal testing for every surgical patient was recommended in only 18.4% of the centers. In-hospital COVID-19 infection was reported from 31.5% of the centers, with higher rates in higher risk countries (high risk, 53.6%; intermediate risk, 26.4%; low risk, 14.8%; P < 0.001). Of the 295 centers that experienced in-hospital COVID-19 infection, 122 (41.4%) failed to trace it and 58 (19.7%) reported the infection originating from asymptomatic patients/staff members. Higher risk countries adopted more preventive measures including universal testing, routine testing of hospital staff and use of dedicated personal protective equipment in operation theatres, but there were remarkable discrepancies across the countries. Conclusions: This large international survey captured the global surgical practice under the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the insufficient preoperative screening of COVID-19 in the current surgical practice.

METHODS: We retrospectively extracted data on critical COVID-19 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from April to December 2020 and evaluated their pulmonary function, residual respiratory symptoms, and radiographic abnormalities on CT. RESULTS: We extracted 17 patients whose median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR], 59C67) years. The median lengths of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation were 23 (IQR, 18C38) and 9 (IQR, 6C13) days, respectively. At 100 days after symptom onset, the following pulmonary function abnormalities were noted in 8 (47%) patients: a diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (%DL(CO)) of <80% for 6 patients (35%); a percent vital capacity (%VC) of <80% for 4 patients (24%); and a percent forced expiratory volume (FEV(1)%) of <70%for 1 patient (6%) who also presented with %DL(CO) and %VC abnormalities.

In this study, we have identified the major histocompatibility complex class I C molecule (HLA-C) as an attachment factor in facilitating HCoV-HKU1 spike (S)-mediated infection. HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotyped virus was assembled using a human immunodeficiency virus type 1-derived reporter virus harboring the human codon-optimized spike of HCoV-HKU1. We identified human alveolar epithelial A549 cells as the most susceptible cell line among those tested to infection by HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotypes. A549 cells were shown to bind purified soluble HCoV-HKU1 S(1-600) glycopeptide. To search for the functional receptor for HCoV-HKU1, an A549 cDNA expression library was constructed and transduced into the nonpermissive, baby hamster kidney cells line BHK-21. Transduced cells that bind soluble HCoV-HKU1 S(1-600) glycoprotein with C-terminal FLAG were sorted. Sequencing of two independent clones revealed cDNA inserts encoding HLA-C. Inhibition of HLA-C expression or function by RNAi silencing and anti-HLA-C antibody decreased HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotyped virus infection of A549 cells by 62 to 65%, whereas pretreatment of cells with neuraminidase decreased such infection by only 13%. When HLA-C was constitutively expressed in another nonpermissive cell line, NIH-3T3, quantitative PCR showed that the binding of HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotyped virus to cell surfaces was increased by 200-fold, but the cells remained nonsusceptible to HCoV-HKU1 S pseudotyped virus infection. Our data suggest that HLA-C is involved in the attachment of HCoV-HKU1 to A549 cells and is a potential candidate to facilitate cell entry. However, other unknown surface proteins on A549 cells may be concomitantly utilized by S glycoprotein of HCoV-HKU1 during viral entry.

Objectives: The objective was to understand the spatial distribution and trends of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Mumbai during the lockdown period and draw insights for effective actions. Methods: Spatial and trend analysis was conducted to trace the spread of the virus during the lockdown period in April 2020. The administrative divisions of Mumbai, in the form of wards and zones, have been used as units of analysis. Results: Greater Mumbai area occupies only 0.015% of the landmass of India, but is contributing to over 20% of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in India. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections have increased over 375 times within 50 days of the lockdown. An analysis of trends across the wards during the 3-week period (April 4 to April 25) shows a skewed pattern, with three zones out of six contributing to the vast majority of cases in Mumbai. The wards with higher formal economic activity are relatively less affected than the other wards. The test positivity rate in Mumbai is much higher than the rest of India.

Yet, preparedness and operational capabilities in this sector remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was twofold; first, to identify appropriate measures of preparedness, and second, to assess preparedness levels and factors significantly associated with preparedness. METHODS: Three separate checklists were developed to measure different aspects of preparedness: MFI Plan Elements, Operational Capabilities, and Pre-existing Resource Networks. Using a cross-sectional study design, data on these and other variables of interest were collected in 2014 from a national convenience sample of ME/C using an internet-based, anonymous survey. Preparedness levels were determined and compared across Federal Regions and in relation to the number of Presidential Disaster Declarations, also by Federal Region. Bivariate logistic and multivariable models estimated the associations between organizational characteristics and relative preparedness. RESULTS: A large proportion (42%) of respondents reported that less than 25 additional fatalities over a 48-hour period would exceed their response capacities. The preparedness constructs measured three related, yet distinct, aspects of preparedness, with scores highly variable and generally suboptimal. Median scores for the three preparedness measures also varied across Federal Regions and as compared to the number of Presidential Declared Disasters, also by Federal Region. Capacity was especially limited for activating missing persons call centers, launching public communications, especially via social media, and identifying temporary interment sites. The provision of staff training was the only factor studied that was significantly (positively) associated (p < .05) with all three preparedness measures. Although ME/Cs ranked local partners, such as Offices of Emergency Management, first responders, and funeral homes, as the most important sources of assistance, a sizeable proportion (72%) expected federal assistance. CONCLUSIONS: The three measures of MFI preparedness allowed for a broad and comprehensive assessment of preparedness. In the future, these measures can serve as useful benchmarks or criteria for assessing ME/Cs preparedness. The study findings suggest multiple opportunities for improvement, including the development and implementation of national strategies to ensure uniform standards for MFI management across all jurisdictions.

There is, however, the possibility that central banks buy new securities from the Treasury to finance such exceptional spending. Considering several economic constraints that policymakers face, this policy will not conflict with the inflation constraint. Money is an endogenous variable that does not cause but just validates a going inflation. It conflicts partially with the fiscal constraint, but avoids the increase in the public debt. And, in this case, it does not have the bad consequences of fiscal indisciplineexcess demand that, successively, causes increases in imports and current account deficits that appreciate the national currency, accelerate inflation, and lead to currency crises.

METHODS AND RESULTS: 148 COVID\\\\19 patients with pre\\\\existing hypertension with clarified outcomes (discharge or deceased) from a national cohort in China were included in this study, of whom 103 were discharged and 45 died in hospital. Multivariate regression showed higher odds of in\\\\hospital death associated with high\\\\sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs\\\\cTn) > 28 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55C6.91) and interleukin\\\\6 (IL\\\\6) > 7 pg/ml (HR: 3.63, 95% CI:1.54C8.55) at admission. Patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) (n = 52) which were defined as systolic BP 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP 90 mm Hg for more than once (2 times) during hospitalization, were more likely to have ICU admission (p = 0.037), invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.028), and renal injury (p = 0.005). A stricter BP control with the threshold of 130/80 mm Hg was associated with lower mortality.

CONCLUSION: Among COVID\\\\19 patients with pre\\\\existing hypertension, elevated hs\\\\cTn and IL\\\\6 could help clinicians to identify patients with fatal outcomes at an early stage, blood pressure control is associated with better clinical outcomes, and RAAS suppressors do not increase mortality and may decrease the need for ICU admission.","output":"Predictors of fatal outcomes among hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients with pre\\\\existing hypertension in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: In this longitudinal study, with a follow-up of 8 years, multidimensional prognostic index (MPI), a product of the comprehensive geriatric assessment, significantly predicted the onset of fractures in older people affected by knee osteoarthritis. PURPOSE: Frailty may be associated with higher fracture risk, but limited research has been carried out using a multidimensional approach to frailty assessment and diagnosis. The present research aimed to investigate whether the MPI, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), is associated with the risk of fractures in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) study. METHODS: Community-dwellers affected by knee OA or at high risk for this condition were followed-up for 8 years. A standardized CGA including information on functional, nutritional, mood, comorbidity, medication, quality of life, and co-habitation status was used to calculate the MPI. Fractures were diagnosed using self-reported information. Coxs regression analysis was carried out and results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs), with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 4024 individuals (mean age 61.0 years, females = 59.0%). People with incident fractures had a significant higher MPI baseline value than those without (0.42  0.18 vs. 0.40  0.17). After adjusting for several potential confounders, people with an MPI over 0.66 (HR = 1.49; 95%CI: 1.11C2.00) experienced a higher risk of fractures. An increase in 0.10 point in MPI score corresponded to an increase in fracture risk of 4% (HR = 1.04; 95%CI: 1.008C1.07). Higher MPI values were also associated with a higher risk of non-vertebral clinical fractures. CONCLUSION: Higher MPI values at baseline were associated with an increased risk of fractures, reinforcing the importance of CGA in predicting fractures in older people affected by knee OA.","output":"Multidimensional prognostic index and the risk of fractures: an 8-year longitudinal cohort study in the Osteoarthritis Initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the case of a young female patient admitted to our emergency department during the Italian COVID-19 epidemic, for fever and dry cough associated with symptoms of gastric reflux over the previous 5 days.

DESIGN: A national multiphase priority setting methodology in partnership with the James Lind Alliance delivered over 16 months (June 2020CSeptember 2021). Part 1: a national scoping survey asked respondents to submit their research uncertainties related to PICU nutrition. Part 2: summarizing and evidence-checking the submitted uncertainties. Part 3: interim prioritization survey. Part 4: consensus workshop. SETTING: PICU. PARTICIPANTS: Patients, parents, and carers of patients who had been admitted to PICU, and PICU healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of these patients within the United Kingdom. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A national scoping survey asked respondents to submit their research uncertainties related to PICU nutrition. In the first survey, 165 topic ideas were suggested (12% by parents/carers and 88% by PICU healthcare professionals). These were categorized into 57 summary questions. The existing evidence was searched to ensure that the proposed summary questions had not already been answered. Forty were judged to be true uncertainties following a systematic literature review. These 40 uncertainties were grouped into eight themes for the second interim survey, which asked respondents to prioritize their top research questions. One hundred and forty participants contributed to this second interim survey. A final shortlist of 25 questions was derived, with the top 18 questions taken to a multistakeholder workshop where a consensus was reached on the top 10 priorities. CONCLUSIONS: This research identified important research gaps in the management of patients in PICU. Areas that need to be addressed as a priority include energy requirements in ventilated neonates, nutritional supplementation of probiotics to manage and prevent sepsis, the impact of postintensive care syndrome on nutrition and growth, and when to commence parenteral (IV) nutrition.

METHODS: Active surveillance was completed on 47 households in rural coastal Kenya over 6 months during a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) were taken from 483 household members twice weekly irrespective of symptoms. Using molecular diagnostics, NPSs from 6 households were screened for 15 respiratory viruses and the remainder of households only for the most frequent viruses observed: rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus (HCoV; comprising strains 229E, OC43, and NL63), adenovirus (AdV), and RSV (A and B). RESULTS: Of 16928 NPSs tested for the common viruses, 4259 (25.2%) were positive for 1 target; 596 (13.8%) had coinfections. Detection frequencies were 10.5% RV (1780), 7.5% HCoV (1274), 7.3% AdV (1232), and 3.2% RSV (537). On average, each household and individual had 6 and 3 different viruses detected over the study period, respectively. Rhinovirus and HCoV were detected in all the 47 households while AdV and RSV were detected in 45 (95.7%) and 40 (85.1%) households, respectively. The individual risk of infection over the 6-month period was 93.4%, 80.1%, 71.6%, 61.5%, and 37.1% for any virus, RV, HCoV, AdV, and RSV, respectively.

Despite the deployment of sophisticated computational systems to identify fake news, as well as the streamlining of fact-checking methods, appropriate fake news detection mechanisms have not yet been found. In fact, technological approaches are likely to be inefficient, given that fake news are based mostly on partisanship and identity politics, and not necessarily on outright deception. However, as disinformation is inherently expressed linguistically, this is a privileged room for forensic linguistic analysis. This article builds upon a forensic linguistic analysis of fake news pieces published in English and in Portuguese, which were collected since 2019 from acknowledged fake news outlets. The preliminary empirical analysis reveals that fake news pieces employ particular linguistic features, e.g. at the levels of typography, orthography and spelling, and morphosyntax. The systematic identification of these features, which will allow mapping linguistic resources and patterns used in those contexts, contributes to scholarship, not only by enabling a streamlined development of computational detection systems, but more importantly by permitting the forensic linguistics expert to assist criminal investigations and give evidence in court.","output":"Fighting the Fake: A Forensic Linguistic Analysis to Fake News Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Flaviviridae include almost 70 viruses, nearly half of which have been associated with human disease. These viruses are among the most important arthropod-borne viruses worldwide and include dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Morbidity and mortality caused by these viruses vary, but collectively they account for millions of encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, arthralgia, rash, and fever cases per year. Most of the members of this family are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by arthropod vectors, most commonly mosquitoes or ticks. Transmission cycles can be simple or complex depending on the hosts, vectors, the virus, and the environmental factors affecting both hosts and viruses. Replication of virus in invertebrate hosts does not seem to result in any significant pathology, which suggests a close evolutionary relationship between virus and vector. Another example of this relationship is the ability of these viruses to grow in invertebrate cell culture, where replication usually results in a steady state, persistent infection, often without cytopathic effect. Yields of virus from insect cell culture vary but are generally similar to yields in vertebrate cells. Replication kinetics are comparable between insect and vertebrate cell lines, despite differences in incubation temperature. Both vertebrate and insect cell culture systems continue to play a significant role in flavivirus isolation and the diagnosis of disease caused by these agents. Additionally, these culture systems permit the study of flavivirus attachment, penetration, replication, and release from cells and have been instrumental in the production and characterization of live-attenuated vaccines.

Unintended consequences might be delays in treatment for other diseases and subsequent mortality. We examined national all-cause mortality comparing weeks 1C27 in 2020 and 2015C2019. This registry-based study used Danish national registry data until 5 July 2020. We examined all-cause mortality rates among all deaths recorded from 2015 to 2020 and among chronic conditions (cardiovascular (cardiac & circulatory), chronic pulmonary, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and diabetes), comparing each week in 2020 to weeks in 2015C2019. In 2020, there were 28,363 deaths in weeks 1C27 (30 December 2019C5 July 2020), the mean deaths in 2015C2019 were 28,630 deaths (standard deviation 784). Compared to previous years, the mortality rate in weeks 3C10 of 2020 was low, peaking in week 14 (17.6 per 100,000 persons in week 9, 19.9 per 100,000 in week 14). Comorbidity prevalence among deceased individuals was similar in 2020 and 2015C2019: 71.1% of all deceased had a prior cardiovascular diagnosis, 30.0% of all deceased had a prior cardiac diagnosis.

Methods Baseline survey was conducted from February 10, 2020 to February 25, 2020 in patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital on the discharge day. After discharge, patients were free to choose whether isolate in a centralized isolation site (i.e. designated hotel) or their own home for another two weeks. A follow-up survey was conducted at the end of the 2-week post-discharge isolation. Depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health were assessed at both time points using the 9-item patient health questionnaire, 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale and self-rated health scores, respectively. Results Fifty centrally isolated and 45 home isolated patients completed both the baseline and the follow-up assessments. Significant effects of time and time by isolation form were found on depression and anxiety levels, with a significant decrease in depression and anxiety shown in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. Besides, a significant time effect was identified on self-rated health with significant improvement found in home isolated but not in centrally isolated patients. Conclusions Home isolation is superior to centralized isolation in the recovery of COVID-19-associated depression, anxiety as well as self-rated health. More attention needs to be paid to the psychological well-being of centrally isolated patients.

The restrictions imposed across countries on the movement of people and the realignment of health care services in response to the pandemic are likely to negatively affect the health status and delivery of mental health services to persons with dual disorders (PWDD). Methods: An online survey was conducted among mental health professionals involved in providing care to PWDD to better understand the problems encountered and identify potential solutions in providing continued treatment for PWDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The findings confirmed significant disruption in the delivery of treatment services for PWDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dissatisfaction with personal protective equipment, inadequate COVID-19 testing services at treatment facility, and lack of guidelines on providing continued treatment services to PWDD by national authorities or professional bodies were identified as the likely reasons for this disruption. Conclusions: These concerns in turn need to be addressed by the policy-makers, hospital management staff, and other stakeholders. Specifically, there should be a focus on developing and disseminating guidelines to assist mental health professionals in setting-up and providing continued treatment services to PWDD via tele-psychiatry and other novel digital strategies.","output":"Treatment Needs and Service Delivery for Patients with Dual Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From the WADD Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, a new, rapidly spreading coronavirus strain, has reached more than 150 countries and is gaining worldwide attention The shortage of successful SARS-CoV-2 medicines or vaccines has exacerbated the situation even further Therefore, research is urgently required to establish effective therapeutics and affordable diagnosis For COVID-19 It is the responsibility of the scientific research community in this time of health crisis to provide an alternative, reliable, and accessible method for vaccinating human bodies against COVID-19 viral infections, based on focused experimental approaches Corona virus (CoV) is an RNA virus for the forward,forming stick-shaped spikes on its surface This is an undesirable, small RNA genome, with an infinite mode of replication The corona virus causes numerous diseases in mammals, birds, pigs, and chickens It causes upper respiratory tract infections, which can lead to death from respiratory diseases Within this article the author briefly explains this abrupt occurrence Extreme lung disease, extremely pathogenic and newly discovered respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in corona virus of the Middle East It is a research paper on the detection of CoVID-19 infections and their dissemination across the world","output":"Coronavirus-2019 (Covid 19): A review of history, epidemology, structure and life cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe infection is becoming a significant health problem which threaten the lives of patients and the safety and economy of society.

Methods: A UVC light box and FFR rack system was assembled utilizing low pressure mercury lamps peaked at 254 nm and aluminum flashing to reduce shadowing effect. Dose was characterized with the use of UV intensity labels and a UVGI (ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) traceable meter.

Given a higher number of activated MCs present in COVID-19 patients and their association with vascular hyperpermeability events, we investigated the factors that lead to the activation and degranulation of these cells and their harmful effects on the alveolar septum environment provided by the action of its mediators. Therefore, the pyroptotic processes throughout caspase-1 (CASP-1) and alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33) secretion were investigated, along with the immunoexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), bradykinin receptor B1 (B1R) and bradykinin receptor B2 (B2R) on post-mortem lung samples from 24 patients affected by COVID-19. The results were compared to 10 patients affected by H1N1pdm09 and 11 control patients. As a result of the inflammatory processes induced by SARS-CoV-2, the activation by immunoglobulin E (IgE) and degranulation of tryptase, as well as Toluidine Blue metachromatic (TB)-stained MCs of the interstitial and perivascular regions of the same groups were also counted. An increased immunoexpression of the tissue biomarkers CASP-1, IL-33, ACE2, B1R and B2R was observed in the alveolar septum of the COVID-19 patients, associated with a higher density of IgE(+) MCs, tryptase(+) MCs and TB-stained MCs, in addition to the presence of intra-alveolar edema. These findings suggest the direct correlation of MCs with vascular hyperpermeability, edema and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) events that affect patients with a severe form of this disease. The role of KKS activation in events involving the exacerbated increase in vascular permeability and its direct link with the conditions that precede intra-alveolar edema, and the consequent DAD, is evidenced.

Heavy alcohol drinking independently increases TB risk and approximately 25% of PWH globally engage in heavy drinking. While isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy decreases TB incidence and mortality among PWH, heavy drinking during INH is associated with liver toxicity and poor adherence. Interventions are, therefore, urgently needed to decrease alcohol use and improve adherence to INH in this population in settings with high prevalence of HIV and TB like Uganda. METHODS: The Drinkers Intervention to Prevent TB (DIPT) study is a 22 factorial randomized controlled trial among HIV/TB co-infected adults (18 years) who engage in heavy alcohol drinking and live in Uganda. The trial will allocate 680 participants with a 1:1:1:1 individual randomization to receive 6 months of INH and one of the following interventions: (1) no incentives (control), (2) financial incentives contingent on low alcohol use, (3) financial incentives contingent on high adherence to INH, and (4) escalating financial incentives for both decreasing alcohol use and increasing adherence to INH. Incentives will be in the form of escalating lottery-based monetary rewards. Participants will attend monthly visits to refill isoniazid medications, undergo liver toxicity monitoring, and, except for controls, determine eligibility for prizes. We will estimate (a) the effect of incentives contingent on low alcohol use on reduction in heavy drinking, measured via a long-term objective and self-reported metric of alcohol use, at 3- and 6-month study visits, and (b) the effect of incentives contingent on high adherence to INH, measured as >90% pill-taking days by medication event monitoring system cap opening. We will use qualitative methods to explore the mechanisms of any influence of financial incentives on HIV virologic suppression. DISCUSSION: This study will provide new information on low-cost strategies to both reduce alcohol use and increase INH adherence among people with HIV and TB infection who engage in heavy drinking in low-income countries with high HIV and TB prevalence.

A retrospective comparison of SILS and traditional multiport laparoscopic (MP) inguinal hernia repair was conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of the minimally invasive laparoscopic technique. METHODS All laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs performed by three surgeons at a single institution during 4 years were reviewed. Statistical evaluation included descriptive analysis of demographics including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and hernia location (uni- or bilateral), in addition to bivariate and multivariate analyses of surgical technique and outcomes including operative times, conversions, and complications. RESULTS The study compared 129 patients who underwent SILS inguinal hernia repair and 76 patients who underwent MP inguinal hernia repair. The cases included 190 men (92.68 %) with a mean age of 55.36  18.01 years (range, 8-86 years) and a mean BMI of 26.49  4.33 kg/m(2) (range, 17.3-41.7 kg/m(2)). These variables did not differ significantly between the SILS and MP cohorts. The average operative times for the SILS and MP unilateral cases were respectively 57.51 and 66.96 min. For the bilateral cases, the average operative times were 81.07 min for SILS and 81.38 min for MP. A multivariate analysis using surgical approach, BMI, case complexity, and laterality as the covariates demonstrated noninferiority of the SILS technique in terms of operative time (p = 0.031). No conversions from SILS to MP occurred, and the rates of conversion to open procedure did not differ significantly between the cohorts (p = 1.00, Fisher's exact test), nor did the complication rates (p = 0.65,  (2)). CONCLUSIONS As shown by the findings, SILS inguinal herniorrhaphy is a safe and feasible alternative to traditional MP inguinal hernia repair and can be performed successfully with similar operative times, conversion rates, and complication rates.

Modelling, which is like any other hypothesis-driven approach, aims to develop a better understanding of biological phenomena. However, diseases processes generally, and particularly those related to transmission, will in many cases be imperfectly understood or too complex to systematically describe, so models will necessarily be simplifications of the overall system. It is essential, therefore, that models are designed carefully and used appropriately. Key to this is identifying what specific questions a model might be expected to answer and what data is available to inform the model. A particular type of model might be fine for one particular situation but highly inappropriate for another. It is also important to appreciate and communicate what simplifications and assumptions have had to be made and how this might affect the robustness of the modelling results. It is also particularly important to understand that models frequently make what can be hidden assumptions about underlying processes because of the way they have been constructed and these assumptions also need to be carefully considered and made explicit, particularly for non-expert audiences.

Thirty-four patients (79.1%) were determined eligible for CRS with HIPEC during open exploration, whereas nine patients (20.9%) underwent a non-therapeutic laparotomy. Complete or almost complete cytoreduction was achieved in 33 patients (76.7%). In one patient, completeness of cytoreduction was not documented. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a moderate agreement according to weighted Cohens kappa analysis of PCI values calculated during laparoscopy and subsequent open exploration for CRS with HIPEC. Uncertainty of PCI assessment should therefore be kept in mind when performing laparoscopy in patients with peritoneal metastasis.","output":"Limitations of laparoscopy to assess the peritoneal cancer index and eligibility for cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC in peritoneal metastasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that spilled from the bat reservoir. Despite numerous clinical trials and vaccines, the burden remains immense, and the host determinants of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 severity remain largely unknown. Signatures of positive selection detected by comparative functional-genetic analyses in primate and bat genomes can uncover important and specific adaptations that occurred at virus-host interfaces. Here, we performed high-throughput evolutionary analyses of 334 SARS- CoV-2 interacting proteins to identify SARS-CoV adaptive loci and uncover functional differences between modern humans, primates and bats. Using DGINN (Detection of Genetic INNovation), we identified 38 bat and 81 primate proteins with marks of positive selection. Seventeen genes, including the ACE2 receptor, present adaptive marks in both mammalian orders, suggesting common virus-host interfaces and past epidemics of coronaviruses shaping their genomes. Yet, 84 genes presented distinct adaptations in bats and primates. Notably, residues involved in ubiquitination and phosphorylation of the inflammatory RIPK1 have rapidly evolved in bats but not primates, suggesting different inflammation regulation versus humans. Furthermore, we discovered residues with typical virus-host arms-race marks in primates, such as in the entry factor TMPRSS2 or the autophagy adaptor FYCO1, pointing to host-specific in vivo important interfaces that may be drug targets. Finally, we found that FYCO1 sites under adaptation in primates are those associated with severe COVID-19, supporting their importance in pathogenesis and replication. Overall, we identified functional adaptations involved in SARS- CoV-2 infection in bats and primates, critically enlightening modern genetic determinants of virus susceptibility and severity.

In the primary, conventional analyses, the predefined statistical significance thresholds were not reached. We conducted a pre-planned Bayesian analysis to facilitate probabilistic interpretation. METHODS: We analysed outcome data within 90 days in the intention-to-treat population (data available in 967 to 982 patients) using Bayesian models with various sensitivity analyses. Results are presented as median posterior probabilities with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) and probabilities of different effect sizes with 12 mg dexamethasone. RESULTS: The adjusted mean difference on days alive without life support at day 28 (primary outcome) was 1.3 days (95% CrI ?0.3 to 2.9; 94.2% probability of benefit). Adjusted relative risks and probabilities of benefit on serious adverse reactions was 0.85 (0.63 to 1.16; 84.1%) and on mortality 0.87 (0.73 to 1.03; 94.8%) at day 28 and 0.88 (0.75 to 1.02; 95.1%) at day 90. Probabilities of benefit on days alive without life support and days alive out of hospital at day 90 were 85 and 95.7%, respectively. Results were largely consistent across sensitivity analyses, with relatively low probabilities of clinically important harm with 12 mg on all outcomes in all analyses.

The interpretation of absolute values is often debated for various reasons, but the changes in pressure measured are considered very accurate provided that a number of precautions are taken. The information provided by these measurements is unique in nature and has an enormous potential to influence management. It allows to study the exact influence of the chest wall and to determine the real lung distending pressure. It is also the only way to quantify respiratory muscle activity and the work of breathing. RECENT FINDINGS The application of esophageal pressure monitoring potentially covers a large field, especially for what concerns mechanical ventilation. This goes from the acute phase of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to weaning and patient-ventilator interactions. During ARDS, recent findings indicate that this measurement may help titrating the level of positive end-expiratory pressure or to determine the well tolerated upper limit of airway pressure.

It has been suggested that these worries can reduce balance safety by acting as a distracting dual-task. However, it is also possible that worries may serve a protective purpose. The present work adopted a qualitative approach to conduct an in-depth exploration of older peoples experiences of worries about falling. METHODS: semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 community-dwelling older people (mean age = 79 years; males = 5/17) who reported experiencing worries about falling. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: experiencing a fallor otherwise recognising ones balance limitationsbrought the physical realities of participants ageing bodies to the forefront of their awareness. This led to the recognition of their susceptibility for an injurious fall, which triggered worries about falling in situations that threatened their balance. When preventing the subject of their worries (i.e. an injurious fall) was perceived to be within the individuals locus of control, worries led to protective adaptations to behaviour. In contrast, when the subject of their worries was perceived to be outside their control, worries triggered feelings of panicleading to unhelpful changes in behaviour. CONCLUSION: these findings provide novel insight into the development and consequences of worries about falling in older people. They highlight the importance of considering an individuals perception of control before deciding to clinically intervene to reduce worries about falling.","output":"Protective or harmful?

Paired 3 T and 64mT brain images were used to develop and validate a transformation converting standard clinical images to low-field quality images. Separately, 3 T images were aggregated from open-source databases spanning four neuropathologies: low-grade glioma (LGG, N = 76), high-grade glioma (HGG, N = 259), stroke (N = 28), and multiple sclerosis (MS, N = 20). The transformation method was then applied to the open-source data to generate simulated low-field images for each pathology. Convolutional neural networks (DenseNet-121) were trained to detect pathology in axial slices from either 3 T or simulated 64 mT images, and their relative performance was compared to characterize the potential diagnostic capabilities of low-field imaging. Algorithm performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Across all cohorts, pathology detection was similar between 3 T and simulated 64mT images (LGG: 0.97 vs. 0.98; HGG: 0.96 vs. 0.95; stroke: 0.94 vs. 0.94; MS: 0.90 vs 0.87). Pathology detection was further characterized as a function of lesion size, intensity, and contrast. Simulated images showed decreasing sensitivity for lesions smaller than 4 cm(2). While simulations cannot replace prospective trials during the evaluation of medical devices, they can provide guidance and justification for prospective studies.

The reported experience (average response rates 45C80%, further improved with combination schemes) is mostly based on the use of the recombinant IFN a-2a or IFN a-2b. However, these interferon formulations are no longer commercially available in Europe and therefore, the pegylated analogue (pegylated IFN a-2a, Pegasys;Hoffmann-La Roche) has been currently used to treat CTCLs. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of pegylated IFN a-2a in the treatment of mycosis fungoides (MF). We collected data from three referral Cutaneous Lymphoma Units in Greece, covering a 2-year period, before COVID -19 pandemic restrictions. The primary endpoint was to determine the effectiveness of peg IFN as measured by the overall response rate (RR) in this cohort. Secondary endpoints were difference in RRs with respect to gender, disease stage, presence of folliculotropism and treatment features, time to best response, duration of response, drug survival, reasons for drug discontinuation and safety profile. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 15.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Overall, 31 patients were included. Most patients (n=12;38.7%) had -stage disease at peg IFN initiation. In all, 11 (35.5%) patients received PegIFN monotherapy, while 20 (64.5%) subjects on peg IFN concomitantly received bexarotene, acitretin, methotrexate or topical chemotherapy. PegIFN was administered in the majority of patients as third or fourth line therapy (21/31). A 54.8% (17/31) overall response rate was noted: 9.7% and 45.2% for CR and PR, respectively. In our cohort, no differences in RRs with respect to gender (p=0.427), disease stage (p=0.179) or presence of folliculotropism (p=0.532) was observed. Peg IFN was not more effective as monotherapy than as a subsequent agent with respect to overall response (p=0.680). Mean time to best response was 7.294.99 months. Treatment dose was reduced in 8 (25.8%) cases due to drug intolerance. Adverse effects were recorded in 21 (67.7%) cases with leukopenia (n=16;76.1%), fatigue (n=9;42.8%) and anemia (n=4;19.0%) being the most recorded. Overall, peg IFN may be considered an effective additional regimen in the treatment of MF, stage IB or higher, with a rather good tolerance and safety profile.

Therefore, we assumed the perspective of the Emergency Physician and, in this narrative review, we reported a brief presentation of the epidemiology of these symptoms and the characteristics of patients, in whom we could suspect the aforementioned pathologies. We also reported in which patients D-dimer gives useful information. In fact, when the probability of the disease is high, the D-dimer level is futile. On the contrary, given the low specificity of the test, when the probability of the disease is very low, a false-positive value of the D-dimer only increases the risk of overtesting. Patients with low to moderate probability really benefit from the D-dimer testing, in order to prevent the execution of expensive and potentially dangerous imaging tests. In the second part of the review, we focused on the prognostic value of the test in septic patients. The early prognostic stratification of septic patients remains a challenge for the Emergency Physician, in the absence of a definite biomarker or score to rely on. Therefore, we need several parameters for the early identification of patients at risk of an adverse prognosis and the D-dimer may play a role in this demanding task. SARS COVID-19 patients represent an emerging reality, where the role of the D-dimer for prognostic stratification could be relevant. In fact, in patients with severe forms of this disease, the D-dimer reaches very high values, which appear to parallel the course of respiratory failure.

However, literature suggests that the response of nurses to this type of intervention may differ from that of other types of health professionals, in relation to their roles, power, and to the configuration of nursing care activities. To our knowledge, no review has been conducted on A&F interventions with nurses. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the evidence of measured and perceived effects of A&F interventions on nurses' performance. METHODS A mixed methods systematic review design with thematic and narrative synthesis is used. Studies reporting quantitative and qualitative data on the effects of A&F interventions specific to nursing care are considered for inclusion. Studies will be appraised for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Quantitative and qualitative data will be summarized in narrative and tabular form and will be synthetized using a segregated methodologies approach. DISCUSSION Results will describe the characteristics of A&F with nurses, as well as the measured and perceived effects specific to nursing care. The associations between the characteristics and the effects as well as the concordance between measured and perceived effects will be presented. We anticipate that combining the evidence from qualitative and quantitative studies will allow us to provide relevant insight that can inform the design of better suited A&F interventions for nurses. Audit and feedback interventions demonstrate potential for improving the performance of nursing care. As their effectiveness varies greatly depending on the context and the professionals involved, a better understanding of the associations between its characteristics and the measured and perceived effects is valuable for improving the effectiveness of A&F.

Some old drugs have shown clinical benefits after a few small clinical trials that attracted great attention. Clinically, however, many drugs, including those currently used in COVID-19, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir, may cause cardiotoxicity by acting on cardiac potassium channels, especially hERG channel through their off-target effects. The blocking of the hERG channel prolongs QT intervals on electrocardiograms; thus, it might induce severe ventricular arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death. Therefore, while focusing on the efficacy of COVID-19 drugs, the fact that they block hERG channels to cause arrhythmias cannot be ignored. To develop safer and more effective drugs, it is necessary to understand the interactions between drugs and the hERG channel and the molecular mechanism behind this high affinity. In this review, we focus on the biochemical and molecular mechanistic aspects of drug-related blockade of the hERG channel to provide insights into QT prolongation caused by off-label use of related drugs in COVID-19, and hope to weigh the risks and benefits when using these drugs.","output":"Off-label use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 risks prolonging the QT interval by targeting the hERG channel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 lockdown could see older adults facing increased anxiety levels due to social isolation. Additionally, the lockdown could be more difficult for those with lower Quality of Life (QoL). We aim to understand predictive factors of older adult's anxiety symptoms during the lockdown as it is a main psychological concern of COVID-19. METHODS: Four hundred eleven participants (M(age) = 68.95, S.D. = 5.60) completed questionnaires at two time points  before the pandemic and during the lockdown period. Cross-lagged analysis was carried out on two structural equation models C social isolation and anxiety symptoms, and QoL and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Baseline social isolation was associated with more anxiety symptoms at follow-up. However, baseline anxiety symptoms were not associated with social isolation subsequently. For QoL and anxiety symptoms, the relationship was bidirectional.

However, the theoretical aspects and polysemous character of social justice as applied in the field of public health are often assumed rather than explicitly explained. An intersectional justice approach to understanding health inequality, inequity, and injustice might be useful. It argues that preexisting class-, race/ethnicity-, and gender-based health injustice and the socially differentiated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are shaped, interconnectedly, by economic maldistribution, cultural misrecognition, and political misrepresentation. Pursuing health justice requires analyses, strategies, and interventions that integrate the economic, cultural, and political spheres of redistribution, recognition, and representation, respectively. Such an intersectional approach to health justice is even more relevant and compelling in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed after Jan 1, 2000 comparing ECMO to conventional management in patients with severe ARDS. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Primary analysis was by intent-to-treat. RESULTS: We identified two RCTs (CESAR and EOLIA) and combined data from 429 patients. On day 90, 77 of the 214 (36%) ECMO-group and 103 of the 215 (48%) control group patients had died (relative risk (RR), 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6C0.94; P = 0.013; I(2) = 0%). In the per-protocol and as-treated analyses the RRs were 0.75 (95% CI 0.6C0.94) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.68C1.09), respectively. Rescue ECMO was used for 36 (17%) of the 215 control patients (35 in EOLIA and 1 in CESAR). The RR of 90-day treatment failure, defined as death for the ECMO-group and death or crossover to ECMO for the control group was 0.65 (95% CI 0.52C0.8; I(2) = 0%). Patients randomised to ECMO had more days alive out of the ICU and without respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and neurological failure. The only significant treatment-covariate interaction in subgroups was lower mortality with ECMO in patients with two or less organs failing at randomization. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of individual patient data in severe ARDS, 90-day mortality was significantly lowered by ECMO compared with conventional management.

Specifically, the paper explores the effect of financial institution type and firm-related characteristics on loan amounts advanced. The results show that the preferred credit provider matters, with the sensitivity level varying among the three institutional types. Additionally, the collateralization value, the owners equity proportion of fixed assets, and any existing credit facility correlate positively with the outcome variable. There is an inverse relationship between the largest shareholders ownership and the loan amount. The study uses the new product (service) launches to measure innovation.

Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), psoriasis (PsO), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were identified using established disease-specific case definitions applied to health administrative data. Vaccination status was extracted from the provincial COVaxON registry. Weekly cumulative proportions of first and second doses up until October 3, 2021 were expressed as the vaccinated percentage of each disease group, and compared to the general Ontario population, and stratified by age. RESULTS By October 3, 2021, the cumulative percentage with at least one dose was 82.1% for the general population, 88.9% for RA, 87.4% for AS, 90.6% for PsA, 87.3% for PsO, and 87.0% for IBD. There was also a higher total cumulative percentage with two doses among IMIDs (83.8-88.2%) vs the general population (78.0%). The difference was also evident when stratifying by age.

METHODS: We used a dataset available from Tehran Municipality including all cases deceased due RSDs in this city between 2008 and 2018. Global Morans I was performed to test whether the age-adjusted mortality rates were randomly distributed or had a spatial pattern. Furthermore, Anselin Local Morans I was conducted to identify potential clusters and outliers. RESULTS: During the 10-year study, 519,312 people died in Tehran, 43,177 because of RSDs, which corresponds to 831.1 per 10,000 deaths and 5.0 per 10,000 population. The death rate was much higher in men (56.8%) than in women (43.2%) and the highest occurred in the > 65 age group (71.2%).

SETTING: Currently, little is known if patients living with HIV (PLWH) are at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 or if their antiretrovirals are protective. This study presents epidemiologic and clinical features of COVID-19 infected PLWH in Detroit, Michigan. METHODS: This is a case series that included 14 PLWH with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were evaluated at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between March 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020.

Changes in SpO(2) exposure have been shown to markedly impact outcome, but limiting extreme episodes is an arduous task. Much more complicated than setting alarm policy, it is fraught with balancing alarm fatigue and compliance. Information on optimum strategies is limited. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study intended to describe the relative chance of normoxemia, and risks of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia at relevant SpO(2) levels in the neonatal ICU. The data, paired SpO(2)-PaO(2) and post-menstrual age, are from a single tertiary care unit. They reflect all infants receiving supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation during a 3-year period. The primary measures were the chance of normoxemia (PaO(2) 50C80 mmHg), risks of severe hypoxemia (PaO(2)  40 mmHg), and of severe hyperoxemia (PaO(2)  100 mmHg) at relevant SpO(2) levels. RESULTS: Neonates were categorized by postmenstrual age: < 33 (n = 155), 33C36 (n = 192) and > 36 (n = 1031) weeks. From these infants, 26,162 SpO(2)-PaO(2) pairs were evaluated. The post-menstrual weeks (median and IQR) of the three groups were: 26 (24C28) n = 2603; 34 (33C35) n = 2501; and 38 (37C39) n = 21,058. The chance of normoxemia (65, 95%-CI 64C67%) was similar across the SpO(2) range of 88C95%, and independent of PMA. The increasing risk of severe hypoxemia became marked at a SpO(2) of 85% (25, 95%-CI 21C29%), and was independent of PMA. The risk of severe hyperoxemia was dependent on PMA. For infants < 33 weeks it was marked at 98% SpO(2) (25, 95%-CI 18C33%), for infants 33C36 weeks at 97% SpO(2) (24, 95%-CI 14C25%) and for those > 36 weeks at 96% SpO(2) (20, 95%-CI 17C22%). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia increases exponentially as SpO(2) moves towards extremes.

Relative of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, has genomic organization, which is very similar. In this article, the function and structure of the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are described in great detail. The nsps are expressed as a single or two polyproteins, which are then cleaved into individual proteins using two proteases of the virus, a chymotrypsin-like protease and a papain-like protease. The released proteins serve as centers of virus replication and transcription. Some of these nsps modulate the host's translation and immune systems, while others help the virus evade the host immune system. Some of the nsps help form replication-transcription complex at double-membrane vesicles. Others, including one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and one exonuclease, help in the polymerization of newly synthesized RNA of the virus and help minimize the mutation rate by proofreading. After synthesis of the viral RNA, it gets capped. The capping consists of adding GMP and a methylation mark, called cap 0 and additionally adding a methyl group to the terminal ribose called cap1. Capping is accomplished with the help of a helicase, which also helps remove a phosphate, two methyltransferases, and a scaffolding factor. Among the structural proteins, S protein forms the receptor of the virus, which latches on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor of the host and N protein binds and protects the genomic RNA of the virus. The accessory proteins found in these viruses are small proteins with immune modulatory roles. Besides functions of these proteins, solved X-ray and cryogenic electron microscopy structures related to the function of the proteins along with comparisons to other coronavirus homologs have been described in the article. Finally, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 residues of the proteome during the 2020 pandemic has been described. Some proteins are mutated more often than other proteins, but the significance of these mutation rates is not fully understood.

Two antisera directed against fusion proteins containing sequences encoded in portions of the 3'-terminal 2.0 kb of ORF 1b were used to immunoprecipitate p90, p74, p53, p44, and p32 polypeptides. These polypeptides were clearly different in electrophoretic mobility, antiserum reactivity, and partial protease digestion pattern from viral structural proteins and from polypeptides encoded in the 5' end of ORF 1a, previously identified by in vitro translation. The largest of these polypeptides had partial protease digestion patterns similar to those of polypeptides generated by in vitro translation of a synthetic mRNA derived from the 3' end of ORF 1b. The polypeptides encoded in ORF 1b accumulated more slowly during in vitro translation than polypeptides encoded in ORF 1a. This is consistent with the hypothesis that translation of gene A initiates at the 5' end of ORF 1a and that translation of ORF 1b occurs following a frameshift at the ORF 1a-ORF 1b junction.

The involvement of T cell immunity in this exacerbation remains unclear. To identify predictive markers of COVID-19 progress and outcome, we analyzed peripheral blood of 10 COVID-19-associated ARDS patients and 35 mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, not requiring intensive care. Using multi-parametric flow cytometry, we compared quantitative, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of circulating bulk immune cells, as well as SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-reactive T cells between the two groups. ARDS patients demonstrated significantly higher S-protein-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to non-ARDS patients. Of interest, comparison of circulating bulk T cells in ARDS patients to non-ARDS patients demonstrated decreased frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, with activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migration molecule CD11a++. Importantly, survival from ARDS (4/10) was accompanied by a recovery of the CD11a++ T cell subsets in peripheral blood. Conclusively, data on S-protein-reactive polyfunctional T cells indicate the ability of ARDS patients to generate antiviral protection. Furthermore, decreased frequencies of activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migratory molecule CD11a++ observed in circulation of ARDS patients might suggest their involvement in ARDS development and propose the CD11a-based immune signature as a possible prognostic marker.","output":"COVID-19-Induced ARDS Is Associated with Decreased Frequency of Activated Memory/Effector T Cells Expressing CD11a+"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this note, we consider data subjected to middle censoring where the variable of interest becomes unobservable when it falls within an interval of censorship.

Accurate and timely global data on access to electricity in all countries is important for the achievement of SDG7. Current survey-based access to electricity datasets suffers from short time spans, slow updates, high acquisition costs, and a lack of location data. Accordingly, a new method for identifying the electrification status of built-up areas based on the remote sensing of nighttime light is proposed in this study. More specifically, the method overlays global built-up area data with night-time light remote sensing data to determine whether built-up areas are electrified based on a threshold night-time light value. By using our approach, electrified and unelectrified built-up areas were extracted at 500 m resolution on a global scale for the years 2014 and 2020. The acquired results show a significant reduction in an unelectrified built-up area between 2014 and 2020, from 51,301.14 km2 to 22,192.52 km2, or from 3.05% to 1.32% of the total built-up area.

Despite increasing international calls for the inclusion of evidence-based decision-making (EBDM) processes in chronic disease prevention and control programming as well as policymaking, there is relatively little research that assesses the current capacity of physicians and the factors that influence that capacity in China. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted in community health centres (CHCs) in Shanghai, China, using multistage cluster sampling. An evidence-based chronic disease prevention (EBCDP) evaluation tool was employed to assess physician EBCDP awareness, adoption, implementation and maintenance based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and using a 7-point Likert scale. Linear regression analysis was used to assess associations between each EBCDP aspect and overall EBCDP status with participant characteristics or organizational factors. RESULT: A total of 892 physicians from CHCs in Shanghai, China, were assessed. The physicians perceived their awareness (mean = 4.90, SD = 1.02) and maintenance (mean = 4.71, SD = 1.07) of EBCDP to be relatively low. Physicians with relatively lower job titles and monthly incomes (> 9000 RMB) tended to have relatively higher scores for the awareness, adoption, and implementation of EBCDP (P < 0.05). Those who had participated in one program for chronic disease prevention and control were less likely to adopt (b = - 0.284, P = 0.007), implement (b = - 0.292, P = 0.004), and maintain (b = - 0.225, P = 0.025) EBCDP than those who had participated in more programs. Physicians in general practice (Western medicine) had a lower level of awareness of EBCDP than those in other departments (P < 0.0001). Physician from CHCs located in suburban areas had lower scores for awareness (b = - 0.150, P = 0.047), implementation (b = - 0.171, P = 0.029), and maintenance (b = - 0.237, P = 0.002) that those from urban CHCs.

Sources of in-hospital transmission are not fully understood, with special precautions currently reserved for procedures previously shown to generate aerosols (particles <5 m). Pleural procedures are not currently considered AGPs (Aerosol Generating Procedures), reflecting a lack of data in this area. METHODS: An underwater seal chest drain bottle (R54500, Rocket Medical UK) was set up inside a 60-litre plastic box and connected via an airtight conduit to a medical air supply. A multichannel particle counter (TSI Aerotrak 9310 Aerosol Monitor) was placed inside the box, allowing measurement of particle count/cubic foot (pc/ft(3)) within six channel sizes: 0.3C0.5, 0.5C1, 1C3, 3C5, 5C10 and >10 m. Stabilised particle counts at 1, 3 and 5 L/min were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test; p values were Bonferroni-adjusted. Measurements were repeated with a simple anti-viral filter, designed using repurposed materials by the study team, attached to the drain bottle. The pressure within the bottle was measured to assess any effect of the filter on bottle function. RESULTS: Aerosol emissions increased with increasing air flow, with the largest increase observed in smaller particles (0.3C3 m). Concentration of the smallest particles (0.3C0.5 m) increased from background levels by 700, 1400 and 2500 pc/ft(3) at 1, 3 and 5 L/min, respectively. However, dispersion of particles of all sizes was effectively prevented by use of the viral filter at all flow rates. Use of the filter was associated with a maximum pressure rise of 0.3 cm H(2)O after 24 hours of flow at 5 L/min, suggesting minimal impact on drain function. CONCLUSION: A bubbling chest drain is a source of aerosolised particles, but emission can be prevented using a simple anti-viral filter.

Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns showed that Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolates from both types of samples were resistant to Ofloxacin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, Oxacillin, and Cefoxitin. However, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) detection was 43.75% in full-term and 75% in preterm placental samples.

Thus, the logistic model with the health belief model is used to determine behaviour decisions through the health belief model constructs. Furthermore, we propose 4 candidate infectious disease models without and with individual behaviour change and use approximate Bayesian computation based on sequential Monte Carlo method for model selection. The main results indicate that the classical compartment model without behaviour change and the model with average rate of behaviour change depicted by an exponential function could fit the observed data best. The results provide a new way on how to choose an infectious disease model to predict the disease prevalence trend or to evaluate the influence of intervention measures on disease control.

Telemedicine, which includes medical advice given over telephone, Internet, mobile phone applications or other similar ways, may be an efficient way to reduce transmission and pressure on medical institutions. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases for literature on the use of telemedicine for COVID-19, SARS and MERS. from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We included studies about the content of the consultation (such as symptoms, therapy and prevention, policy, public service), screening of suspected cases, the provision of advice given to those people who may have symptoms or contact history. We conducted meta-analyses on the main outcomes of the studies. Results: A total of 2041 articles were identified after removing duplicates. After reading the full texts, we finally included nine studies. People were most concerned about symptoms (64.2%), epidemic situation and public problems (14.5%), and psychological problems (10.3%) during COVID-19 epidemic. During the SARS epidemic, the proportions of people asking for consultation for symptoms, prevention and therapy, and psychological problems were 35.0%, 22.0%, and 23.0%, respectively. Two studies demonstrated that telemedicine can be used to screen the suspected patients and give advice. One study emphasized the limited possibilities to follow up people calling hotlines and difficulties in identifying all suspect cases. Conclusions: Telemedicine services should focus on the issues that the public is most concerned about, such as then symptoms, prevention and treatment of the disease, and provide reasonable advice to patients with symptoms or people with epidemic history.

METHODS: This analysis was embedded within a type 3 hybrid trial that enrolled patients across eight OTPs at the start of the pandemic. Enrolled patients reported on past-30 day use of multiple substances during their baseline assessment. Participants re-contacted in May-July 2020 completed a survey about COVID-19-related impacts on various life domains. Using latent class analysis we identified patient subgroups, and then examined group differences on a set of negative and positive COVID-19 impacts related to healthcare access. RESULTS: Of the 188 trial participants, 135 (72 %) completed the survey. Latent class analysis identified three MOUD patient subgroups: minimal use (class probability: 0.25); opioid use (class probability: 0.34); and polysubstance use (class probability: 0.41). Compared to the minimal use group, the polysubstance use group reported increased substance use and difficulty accessing sterile needles, naloxone, and preferred substance. The opioid use group reported increased substance use and difficulty accessing their preferred substance. There were no significant group differences related to accessing routine or specialized healthcare or medication; or paying attention to their health.

These mechanisms are based, at least partly, on different genetic factors shared by many other conditions, such as allergic diseases and obesity. Investigating the shared genetic effects enables better understanding the mechanisms of phenotypic correlations and is less subject to confounding by environmental factors. The increasing availability of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) for asthma has enabled researchers to examine the genetic contributions to the epidemiological associations between asthma subtypes, and those between coexisting diseases/traits and asthma. Studies have found not only shared but also distinct genetic components between asthma subtypes, indicating that the heterogeneity is related to distinct genetics.

Short-term physiologic responses to the vaccine have not been studied using wearable devices. OBJECTIVE: We aim to characterize physiologic changes in response to COVID-19 vaccination in a small cohort of participants using a wearable device (WHOOP Strap 3.0). This is a proof of concept for using consumer-grade wearable devices to monitor response to COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, physiologic data from 19 internal medicine residents at a single institution that received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was collected using the WHOOP Strap 3.0. The primary outcomes were percent change from baseline in heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate (RHR), and respiratory rate (RR). Secondary outcomes were percent change from baseline in total, rapid eye movement, and deep sleep. Exploratory outcomes included local and systemic reactogenicity following each dose and prophylactic analgesic use. RESULTS: In 19 individuals (mean age 28.8, SD 2.2 years; n=10, 53% female), HRV was decreased on day 1 following administration of the first vaccine dose (mean C13.44%, SD 13.62%) and second vaccine dose (mean C9.25%, SD 22.6%). RHR and RR showed no change from baseline after either vaccine dose. Sleep duration was increased up to 4 days post vaccination, after an initial decrease on day 1. Increased sleep duration prior to vaccination was associated with a greater change in HRV. Local and systemic reactogenicity was more severe after dose two. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first observational study of the physiologic response to any of the novel COVID-19 vaccines as measured using wearable devices. Using this relatively small healthy cohort, we provide evidence that HRV decreases in response to both vaccine doses, with no significant changes in RHR or RR. Sleep duration initially decreased following each dose with a subsequent increase thereafter. Future studies with a larger sample size and comparison to other inflammatory and immune biomarkers such as antibody response will be needed to determine the true utility of this type of continuous wearable monitoring in regards to vaccine responses. Our data raises the possibility that increased sleep prior to vaccination may impact physiologic responses and may be a modifiable way to increase vaccine response. These results may inform future studies using wearables for monitoring vaccine responses.

The data of coronaviridae was 135, and the high-frequency TCM were Chaihu (Bupleuri Radix), Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma), and Isatidis Radix. Meanwhile, it was found that Isatidis Radix and Kudouzi (the seed of Sophora alopecuroides) were the most studied TCM during the SARS period in 2003, while in 2020, the research on Sangbaipi (Mori Cortex) was the first when COVID-19 was sudden.

These cells are both target cells for HIV-1 and represent the first opportunity for the virus to interfere with innate recognition. Previously we have shown that both cell types fail to produce type I interferons (IFNs) in response to HIV-1 but that, unlike T cells, the virus does not block IFN induction by targeting IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) for cellular degradation. Thus, either HIV-1 inhibits IFN induction by an alternate mechanism or, less likely, these cells fail to sense HIV-1. Here we show that HIV-1 (but not herpes simplex virus 2 [HSV-2] or Sendai virus)-exposed DCs and macrophages fail to induce the expression of all known type I and III IFN genes. These cells do sense the virus, and pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced signaling pathways are triggered. The precise stage in the IFN-inducing signaling pathway that HIV-1 targets to block IFN induction was identified; phosphorylation but not K63 polyubiquitination of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) was completely inhibited. Two HIV-1 accessory proteins, Vpr and Vif, were shown to bind to TBK1, and their individual deletion partly restored IFN- expression. Thus, the inhibition of TBK1 autophosphorylation by binding of these proteins appears to be the principal mechanism by which HIV-1 blocks type I and III IFN induction in myeloid cells. IMPORTANCE Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are key HIV target cells. Therefore, definition of how HIV impairs innate immune responses to initially establish infection is essential to design preventative interventions, especially by restoring initial interferon production. Here we demonstrate how HIV-1 blocks interferon induction by inhibiting the function of a key kinase in the interferon signaling pathway, TBK1, via two different viral accessory proteins.

RESULTS: Burnout had a significant direct effect on depression, anxiety, physical health, and psychological HRQOL and indirectly affected all subcategories of HRQOL. Viral epidemic-related stress had no significant direct effect on any variable, but indirectly affected all subcategories of HRQOL. Depression and anxiety were endogenous variables (mediators). Depression was a pathway that directly and significantly affected all subcategories of HRQOL. Burnout had the most significant effect on physical health and psychological HRQOL, whereas depression had the greatest effect on social relationships and environmental HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: Low compassion satisfaction caused burnout in HCPs, and burnout was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and HRQOL. Furthermore, HRQOL showed a greater response when affected by indirect burnout through depression and anxiety than when directly affected by burnout.","output":"Stress- and Work-Related Burnout in Frontline Health-Care Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proposed objective is to identify the level of spirituality in university teachers during the context of the pandemic. The correlational descriptive quantitative methodology was used with Mann Whitney's U, Spearman's rho and Kruskal Wallis's H tests in 85 university professors from the Faculties of Health and Humanities of a public entity. Applying the Spirituality scale, the information was analyzed using SPSS, version 24. The results show high levels of spirituality in 96% of teachers. There are statistically significant differences in the scores with respect to age and sex in the spiritual needs dimension, with men and the group between 30 and 39 years old having the highest average (p <0.05). The self-awareness dimension predominated at the highest level. Conclusions: spirituality, as a construction given from beliefs, practices and own experiences, represents a relevant element for the care of being;considering it essential to face difficulties, especially in apparently disruptive situations such as COVID-19. In the experience of the pandemic, teachers adopt spirituality as a part of their being that gives value to themselves, guides the search for harmony with nature and focuses on their goals.Alternate :El objetivo planteado es identificar el nivel de espiritualidad en docentes universitarios durante el contexto de la pandemia.

These effects are largely coordinated through the actions of reproductive hormones (eg, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone). Here, the utility and limitations of minimally invasive sampling techniques are explored, providing a novel perspective on how reproductive hormone measurements can enhance reproductive endocrinology research. Salivary steroid measures are most commonly used, although several dried blood spot and urine assays are also available, and researchers continue to explore the efficacy of other sample types. These relatively simple measures have facilitated the collection of multiple samples from a single participant, allowing researchers to more accurately track the diurnal and cyclical variation exhibited by many reproductive hormones. Ultimately, the ability to collect fine-grained participant data allows biological anthropologists to better test questions central to human reproductive ecology, life history theory, and public health. For example, fieldwork using these techniques suggests that testosterone profile variation across populations is influenced by energetic constraints and reproductive status. Moreover, hormone concentrations shape the development of sex characteristics, with implications for evolutionary questions related to sexual selection. Hormone levels also can be used to identify a range of medical concerns (eg, suppressed hormone production levels linked with psychosocial stress). These findings highlight how minimally invasive collection techniques can be applied to test diverse evolutionary hypotheses and identify important health concerns. Still, more work is needed to standardize collection and laboratory analysis procedures, thereby enabling more direct data comparisons between researchers.","output":"Reproductive hormone measurement from minimally invasive sample types: Methodological considerations and anthropological importance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundIn December 2019, a pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and has rapidly spread around the world since then.AimThis study aims to understand the research gaps related to COVID-19 and propose recommendations for future research.MethodsWe undertook a scoping review of COVID-19, comprehensively searching databases and other sources to identify literature on COVID-19 between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020.

We will also review the importance of respiratory infections and exacerbations of asthma and will discuss genetic factors controlling host immune responses to respiratory infection and the influence these may exert on asthma pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS Birth cohort studies have demonstrated bidirectional relationships between early life severe respiratory infections and asthma development; however, whether there is a clear causal role for severe respiratory infection early in life leading directly to asthma development remains unknown. The role of rhinovirus infection in asthma exacerbations has been investigated experimentally, with asthmatic patients exhibiting greater clinical illness severity, which was related to increased virus load and lower airways inflammation. Polymorphisms in genes involved in innate, antiviral and Th1 and Th2 immune responses have been linked to asthma as well as to early life severe respiratory infections, suggesting that host factors are likely to play an important role in their association. SUMMARY Early in life, such genetic factors contribute to the risk of severe lower respiratory tract viral infection as well as later development of wheezing illness and asthma.

To do so, we examine the case of blockchain as one of the emerging innovative work-streams in development practices that could lead the way forward and pave the path for new developmental narratives as we all navigate the uncharted territories of the new digital age. This paper provides useful insights about the underlying dynamics underpinning the adoption of blockchain backed-solutions for sustainable development, and it showcases some of the promising use-cases being developed through trial-and-error experiments by its early adopters. The paper offers a deep dive into a burgeoning development practice in search of disrupting business-as-usual to solve increasingly complex development challenges by mainstreaming innovations such as blockchain-enabled solutions to rethink the ways in which development solutions are being delivered across the SDG spectrum. This work points to the significant potential of blockchain technology as a game changer in solving some of the most pressing issues hindering the global recovery post Covid-19 to transition towards greener and more inclusive economies. Nevertheless, we also stress that the hype-cycle behind the lets blockchain it trend does not mean that blockchain-backed solutions are necessarily superior to other alternatives which might be less costly and less technical in nature.

OBJECTIVES: We present a comparison of ARG abundance across various animal species, production environments and humans in Europe. AMR variation sources were quantified. The correlation of ARG abundance between qPCR data and previously published metagenomic data was assessed. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in nine European countries, comprising 9572 samples. qPCR was used to quantify abundance of ARGs [aph(3')-III, erm(B), sul2, tet(W)] and 16S rRNA. Variance component analysis was conducted to explore AMR variation sources. Spearman's rank correlation of ARG abundance values was evaluated between pooled qPCR data and earlier published pooled metagenomic data. RESULTS: ARG abundance varied strongly among animal species, environments and humans. This variation was dominated by between-farm variation (pigs) or within-farm variation (broilers, veal calves and turkeys). A decrease in ARG abundance along pig and broiler production chains ('farm to fork') was observed. ARG abundance was higher in farmers than in slaughterhouse workers, and lowest in control subjects. ARG abundance showed a high correlation (Spearman's a??>a??0.7) between qPCR data and metagenomic data of pooled samples. CONCLUSIONS: qPCR analysis is a valuable tool to assess ARG abundance in a large collection of livestock-associated samples. The between-country and between-farm variation of ARG abundance could partially be explained by antimicrobial use and farm biosecurity levels.

In two pre-registered experiments, we investigated the degree to which young adults' concerns about COVID-19 correlated with their ability to sustain attention. Experiment 1 tested mainly European participants during an early phase of the pandemic. After completing a survey probing COVID-related concerns, participants engaged in a continuous performance task (CPT) over two, 4-min blocks, during which they responded to city scenes that occurred 90% of the time and withheld responses to mountain scenes that occurred 10% of the time. Despite large and stable individual differences, performance on the scene CPT did not significantly correlate with the severity of COVID-related concerns obtained from the survey. Experiment 2 tested US participants during a later phase of the pandemic. Once again, CPT performance did not significantly correlate with COVID concerns expressed in a pre-task survey. However, participants who had more task-unrelated thoughts performed more poorly on the CPT.

Nevertheless, MV is associated with numerous complications and increased mortality. The aim of this study is to define the effects of MV on gene expression of direct and peripheral human tissues. METHODS: Classification models were applied to Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) gene expression data of six representative tissuesCliver, adipose, skin, nerve-tibial, muscle and lung, for performance comparison and feature analysis. We utilized 18 prediction models using the Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) decision tree and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) methods to classify ventilation and non-ventilation samples and to compare their prediction performance for the six tissues. In the model comparison, the AUC (area under receiver operating curve), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the predictive performance of each model. We then conducted feature analysis per each tissue to detect MV marker genes followed by pathway enrichment analysis for these genes. RESULTS: XGBoost outperformed the other methods and predicted samples had undergone MV with an average accuracy for the six tissues of 0.951 and average AUC of 0.945. The feature analysis detected a combination of MV marker genes per each tested tissue, some common across several tissues. MV marker genes were mainly related to inflammation and fibrosis as well as cell development and movement regulation. The MV marker genes were significantly enriched in inflammatory and viral pathways. CONCLUSION: The XGBoost method demonstrated clear enhanced performance and feature analysis compared to the other models. XGBoost was helpful in detecting the tissue-specific marker genes for identifying transcriptomic changes related to MV.

From July 2004 to December 2010, 25 patients were included. GL was described in terms of clinical presentation, time to onset, and location in the staple line. Treatment of GL with pharmacologic, radiologic, endoscopic, and/or surgical procedures was always validated by a multidisciplinary care team. \\"Treatment success\\" was defined as the absence of contrast agent leakage on CT and endoscopy after removal of covered metallic stent or pigtail drains. Systemic inflammation and peritonitis were the main signs for early-onset GL (56%), whereas pulmonary symptoms and intra-abdominal abscesses revealed delayed-onset GL (44%). Surgery was always performed for early-onset GL. In the total study population, the median number of endoscopic procedures was five (range, 1-11) per patient, of covered SEMS was three (range, 1-8), and of pigtail drains was three (range, 1-4). Nine (36%) patients presented endoscopic-related complications. Four (16%) patients with treatment failure underwent radical surgery. The mortality rate was 4% (n = 1).

A defining feature of EAG (Kv10-12) channels is a highly conserved domain on the amino-terminus, known as the eag-domain, consisting of a PAS domain capped by a short sequence containing an amphipathic helix (Cap-domain). The PAS and Cap domains are both vital for the normal function of EAG channels. Using heme-affinity pull-down assays and proteomics of lysates from primary cortical neurons, we identified that an EAG channel, hERG3 (Kv11.3), binds to heme. In whole cell electrophysiology experiments, we identified that heme inhibits hERG3 channel activity. In addition, we expressed the Cap and PAS domain of hERG3 in E.coli and, using spectroscopy and kinetics, identified the PAS domain as the location for heme binding. The results identify heme as a regulator of hERG3 channel activity.

This conceptual framework builds on both the strengths perspective and empowerment theories, and promotes a rights-based approach for international social work and social development. SPACE was first used to design and implement a training-of-trainers program in two communities in Guatemala. The trainings effectiveness in building capacity was evidenced by the impactful networks strengthened or developed as a result of the training in developing COVID-related responses.

For manufacturing digitization, there has been active research and development with a focus on Cloud Manufacturing (CM) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This work presents a computer vision toolkit (CV Toolkit) for non-invasive digitization of the factory floor in line with Industry 4.0 requirements for factory data collection. Currently, technical challenges persist towards digitization of legacy systems due to the limitation for changes in their design and sensors. This novel toolkit is developed to facilitate easy integration of legacy production machinery and factory floor artifacts with the digital and smart manufacturing environment with no requirement of any physical changes in the machines. The system developed is modular, and allows real-time monitoring of production machinery. The modularity aspect allows the incorporation of new software applications in the current framework of CV Toolkit. To allow connectivity of this toolkit with manufacturing floors in a simple, deployable and cost-effective manner, the toolkit is integrated with a known manufacturing data standard, MTConnect, to translate the digital inputs into data streams that can be read by commercial status tracking and reporting software solutions. The proposed toolkit is demonstrated using a mock-panel environment developed in house at the University of Cincinnati to highlight its usability.","output":"Computer Vision Toolkit for Non-invasive Monitoring of Factory Floor Artifacts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of 4-substituted 3,4-dihydropyrimidine-2-ones (DHPM) was synthesized, characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and HRMS spectra.

This is important at weaning, when animals are exposed to infectious agents and stresses. We have developed a rat model of intestinal inflammation post weaning, based on the systemic administration of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB). Since the inflammatory response obtained is mild, the food intake pattern is not affected, which makes this model useful for studies of nutritional therapies for intestinal inflammatory disease. SEB increased T-lymphocytes in Peyer's patches and the number of activated T-lymphocytes in mesenteric lymph nodes (organized GALT). In the lamina propria, SEB increased activated T-lymphocytes as well as cytotoxic and natural killer-cell populations of the diffuse GALT. It also increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators in both Peyer's patches and mucosa. Rats given SEB had higher paracellular permeability to macromolecules, which was associated with a reduction in epithelial tightness. This model was used to examine whether dietary supplementation with spray-dried animal plasma proteins affects intestinal inflammation. Results showed that dietary plasma proteins can attenuate the mucosal immune response in both organized and diffuse GALT and that these effects are mediated by a reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","output":"A rat model of mild intestinal inflammation induced by Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in vaccination of children younger than 1 year during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (March 2020CAugust 2021) in Haiti, Lesotho, Liberia and Malawi. METHODS: We used data from health management information systems on vaccination of children aged 12 months or younger in districts supported by Partners In Health. We used data from January 2016 to February 2020 and a linear model with negative binomial distribution to estimate the expected immunization counts for March 2020CAugust 2021 with 95% prediction intervals, assuming no pandemic. We compared these expected levels with observed values and estimated the immunization deficits or excesses during the pandemic months. FINDINGS: Baseline vaccination counts varied substantially by country, with Lesotho having the lowest count and Haiti the highest. We observed declines in vaccination administration early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Haiti, Lesotho and Liberia. Continued declines largely corresponded to high rates of COVID-19 infection and discrete stock-outs. By August 2021, vaccination levels had returned to close to or above expected levels in Haiti, Liberia and Lesotho; in Malawi levels remained below expected. CONCLUSION: Patterns of childhood immunization coverage varied by country over the course of the pandemic, with significantly lower than expected vaccination levels seen in one country during subsequent COVID-19 waves.

This study was conducted retrospectively to investigate the detailed sinonasal manifestations and dynamic profile of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 patients longitudinally. METHODS: This retrospective study included 11 consecutive patients. The prevalence, timing and severity of sinonasal manifestations were analyzed. Oropharyngeal, nasal, sputum and stool specimens were collected to detect RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 over COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Among the 11 patients, 6 (54.5%) were female, and the median age was 51 (IQR, 36-62) years. Seven patients (63.6%) experienced sinonasal symptoms, with 6 (54.5%) exhibiting sinonasal symptoms on the onset day. Seven patients (63.6%) demonstrated nasal obstruction, 5 (45.5%) had rhinorrhea, and 4 (36.4%) exhibited olfactory dysfunction. All six patients with sinonasal symptoms on the onset day had non-severe infections. Most patients (85.7%) with sinonasal symptoms had non-severe infections.

While some could already achieve successes or consolidate themselves in 2019, most were hoping to continue pressuring governments and building momentum in 2020. The global pandemic squandered these hopes rapidly: collective decision making, still in the domain of governments, became a crucial factor in fighting the crisis, and protest movements as independent actors did not have a direct response. Simultaneously, public space as an arena for conflict articulation became inaccessible due to anti-pandemic efforts. Protestors were thus driven out of the center of public spaces and into the periphery, where they employed decentralized techniques in order to maintain their mobilization and to compete with state institutions in offering policy choices regarding anti-pandemic efforts. While limiting repertoires of protest movements, new conflict arenas allow them to sustain mobilization for future protest movements and continue challenging state actors. This period of limited protest activities can be used by governments, to accumulate political capital from efficient anti-pandemic policies and to foster cooperations with protesters.

Antimicrobial activity of NSAIDs is often reported and this study evaluated the antimicrobial potential of the two most common NSAIDs, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and paracetamol (acetaminophen), against 293 clinical strains of bacteria. The ability of aspirin and paracetamol to convert minocycline and doxycyclin-resistant bacteria into sensitivity was also tested using micro-broth dilution assays used for determining minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Aspirin inhibited all 293 bacterial strains at 10.24 mg/ mL concentration. Except for one strain each of Serratia grimaceae and S, aureus paracetamol inhibited none of the 293 strains at 10.24 mg/ mL. Of the 293 strains 116 (39.59%) were sensitive (MIC 4 g/mL) to doxycycline and 127 (43.34%) to minocycline. Of the selected 57 minocycline-resistant (MIC >4 g/mL) strains aspirin converted 32 (56.14%) to minocycline-sensitive.

The simulated iMDA regimen was assumed to be delivered monthly to the targeted population for 3 months each year from 2023 to 2027. A broad set of parameters of ivermectin efficacy, uptake levels and global intervention scenarios were used to predict averted malaria cases and deaths. We then explored the potential averted treatment costs, expected implementation costs and cost-effectiveness ratios under different scenarios. RESULTS: In the scenario where coverage of malaria interventions was maintained at 2018 levels, we found that iMDA in these nine countries has the potential to reverse the predicted growth of malaria burden by averting 20C50 million cases and 36 000C90 000 deaths with an assumed efficacy of 20%. If iMDA has an efficacy of 40%, we predict between 40C99 million cases and 73 000C179 000 deaths will be averted with an estimated net cost per case averted between US$2 and US$7, and net cost per death averted between US$1460 and US$4374. CONCLUSION: This study measures the potential of iMDA to reverse the increasing number of malaria cases for several sub-Saharan African countries. With additional efficacy information from ongoing clinical trials and country-level modifications, our analytical tool can help determine the appropriate uptake strategies of iMDA by calculating potential marginal gains and costs under different scenarios.","output":"Potential impact of 5 years of ivermectin mass drug administration on malaria outcomes in high burden countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor via its receptor-binding domain (RBD), with the RBD-ACE2 complex presenting an essential molecular target for vaccine development to stall the virus infection proliferation.

ABSTRACT: Because of their reluctance to visit the hospital due to concerns about contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), patients with colorectal cancer have been affected by delays in care during the pandemic. This study assessed the effects of the pandemic on the clinical characteristics and surgical treatment patterns of colorectal cancer patients at a tertiary medical facility in Korea. Patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery at our institution between March and September 2020 were analyzed. Clinicopathological and treatment characteristics were compared with those of patients who underwent surgery in 2018 and 2019. The patients who did not undergo tumor resection (4.1% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001) and who received neoadjuvant treatment (16.7% vs. 14.7%, p = 0.039) were significantly higher during the COVID period. The minimally invasive approach was performed less during the COVID period (81.2% vs. 88%, p < 0.001). More patients in the COVID period required combined resection of organs adjacent to the tumor (4.8% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.017). Surgical aggressiveness, as shown by the proportion of patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery and adjacent organ resection, was significantly influenced by the pandemic. In addition, resectability decreased during the COVID period. These characteristics will likely influence long-term oncological outcomes, indicating the need for long-term monitoring of this cohort.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Surgical Treatment Patterns for Colorectal Cancer in a Tertiary Medical Facility in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Secondary prevention of coronary artery disease, self-management behavior, and blood pressure control are important to cardiovascular event prevention and promotion of quality of life (QOL), but they are underutilized. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a self-efficacy theory-based health information technology intervention implemented through blood control and patient self-management. DESIGN: A clinical randomized waitlist-controlled trial. METHODS: The study was conducted at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. A total of 60 subjects were randomly assigned to either the immediate intervention (experimental) group or the waitlist control group. The primary endpoint was systolic blood pressure at 3 months; secondary end points included self-management behavior and QOL. Treatment for the immediate intervention group lasted 3 months, while the waitlist control group received routine care for the first 3 months, at which point they crossed over to the intervention arm and received the same intervention as the experimental group for another 3 months. Both groups were evaluated by questionnaires and physiological measurements at both 3 and 6 months postadmission. The results were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure significantly improved for the intervention group participants at 3 months, when there was also significant improvement in self-management behavior and QOL. There was no significant or appreciable effect of time spent in the waitlist condition, with treatments in the two conditions being similarly effective. CONCLUSION: The use of a theory-based health information technology treatment compared with usual care resulted in a significant improvement in systolic blood pressure, self-management behavior, and QOL in patients with coronary artery disease.

NAVA has mainly been studied in children who underwent cardiac surgery during the period of weaning from a respirator. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a series of 3 children (1 month, 3 years, and 28 days old) with severe respiratory distress due to RSV-related bronchiolitis requiring invasive mechanical ventilation with a high level of oxygen (FiO(2 )50%) for whom NAVA facilitated respiratory support. One of these children had diagnosis criteria for acute lung injury, another for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Establishment of NAVA provided synchronization of mechanical ventilatory support with the breathing efforts of the children. Respiratory rate and inspiratory pressure became extremely variable, varying at each cycle, while children were breathing easily and smoothly. All three children demonstrated less oxygen requirements after introducing NAVA (57  6% to 42  18%). This improvement was observed while peak airway pressure decreased (28  3 to 15  5 cm H(2)O).

Targeting the highly conserved viral genes and/or gene-encoded viral proteins such as main proteinase (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicases are plausible antiviral approaches to prevent replication and propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are prone to extensive mutagenesis; however, any genetic alteration to its highly conserved Mpro enzyme is often detrimental to the viral pathogen. Therefore, inhibitors that target the Mpro enzyme could reduce the risk of mutation-mediated drug resistance and provide effective antiviral protection. Several existing antiviral drugs and dietary bioactives are currently repurposed to treat COVID-19. Dietary bioactives from three ayurvedic medicinal herbs, 18 -glycyrrhetinic acid (G = 8.86 kcal/mol), Solanocapsine (G = 8.59 kcal/mol), and Vasicoline (G = 7.34 kcal/mol), showed high-affinity binding to Mpro enzyme than the native N3 inhibitor (G = 5.41 kcal/mol). Flavonoids strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with comparable or higher potency than the antiviral drug, remdesivir. Several tannin hydrolysates avidly bound to the receptor-binding domain and catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro through H-bonding forces. Quercetin binding to Mpro altered the thermostability of the viral protein through redox-based mechanism and inhibited the viral enzymatic activity. Interaction of quercetin-derivatives with the Mpro seem to be influenced by the 7-OH group and the acetoxylation of sugar moiety on the ligand molecule.

Although based on a relatively simple principle, its complex interaction with the cardiovascular system remains challenging and open to debate. The aim of this work was focused on the development of a new numerical model of IABP. METHODS: The new model was implemented in CARDIOSIM?, which is a modular software simulator of the cardiovascular system used in research and e-learning environment. The IABP is inserted into the systemic bed divided in aortic, thoracic and two abdominal tracts modelled with resistances, inertances and compliances. The effect induced by the balloon is reproduced in each tract of the aorta by the presence of compliances connected to PIABP generator and resistances. PIABP generator reproduces the balloon pressure with the option to change IABP timing. We have used literature data to validate the potential of this new numerical model. RESULTS: The results have shown that our simulations reproduced the typical effects induced during IABP assistance. We have also simulated the effects induced by the device on the hemodynamic variables when the IABP ratio was set to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. The outcome of these simulations is in accordance with literature data measured in the clinical environment. CONCLUSIONS: The new IABP module is easy to manage and can be used as a training tool in a clinical setting. Although based on literature data, the outcome of the simulations is encouraging.

Results: Between March 12 and April 14, 2020, we treated 4,404 persons under investigation for COVID-19 infection, of whom 68% were discharged home, 29% were admitted to a regular floor, and 3% to an ICU. One thousand six hundred fifty-one of 3,369 patients tested have had SARS-CoV-2-positive results to date. Of patients with regular floor admissions, 13% were subsequently upgraded to the ICU after a median of 62 hours (interquartile range 28 to 106 hours). Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation in the ED, 4 required out-of-hospital invasive mechanical ventilation, and another 167 subsequently required invasive mechanical ventilation in a median of 60 hours (interquartile range 26 to 99) hours after admission. Testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and lower oxygen saturations were associated with need for ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation, and with death. High respiratory rates were associated with the need for ICU care. Conclusion: Persons under investigation for COVID-19 infection contribute significantly to the health care burden beyond those ruling in for SARS-CoV-2. For every 100 admitted persons under investigation, 9 will require ICU stay, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both on arrival and another 12 within 2 to 3 days of hospital admission, especially persons under investigation with lower oxygen saturations and positive SARS-CoV-2 swab results. This information should help hospitals manage the pandemic efficiently.","output":"Cohort of Four Thousand Four Hundred Four Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in a New York Hospital and Predictors of ICU Care and Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 36-year-old man with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presented with chest pain, infero-lateral ST segment elevation on ECG and elevation of cardiac biomarkers and inflammatory markers.

The antiviral efficacy of hypericin is largely determined by its affinity toward viral components and by the number of active molecules loaded on single viruses. Here we use an experimental approach to follow the interaction of hypericin with SARS-CoV-2, and we evaluate its antiviral efficacy, both in the dark and upon photoactivation. Binding to viral particles is directly visualized with fluorescence microscopy, and a strong affinity for the viral particles, most likely for the viral envelope, is measured spectroscopically. The loading of a maximum of approximately 30 molecules per viral particle is estimated, despite with marked heterogeneity among particles. Because of this interaction, nanomolar concentrations of photoactivated hypericin substantially reduce virus infectivity on Vero E6 cells, but a partial effect is also observed in dark conditions, suggesting multiple mechanisms of action for this drug.","output":"The Interaction of Hypericin with SARS-CoV-2 Reveals a Multimodal Antiviral Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper offers a parsimonious, rational-choice model to study the effect of pre-existing inequalities on the transmission of COVID-19.

First, non-symptomatic agents do not know if they are infected. Second, some of these agents unknowingly transmit infections. Third, we permit two-sided prevention via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions: the probability of a person catching the virus from another depends on protection choices made by each. We find that a mean-preserving increase in pre-existing income inequality unambiguously increases the equilibrium proportion of unprotected, socializing agents and may increase or decrease the proportion who self-quarantine. Strikingly, while higher pre-COVID inequality may or may not raise the overall risk of infection, it increases the risk of disease in social interactions.","output":"A rational-choice model of Covid-19 transmission with endogenous quarantining and two-sided prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"French Abstract:Le renouveau mondial du nationalisme conomique et du protectionnisme constitue une menace srieuse pour l'orientation de la politique internationale du commerce extrieur vers les principes de l'conomie de march de l'OMC.

Women aged 40 or older, with 0 or 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed after the age of 40 were eligible for risk assessment using MammoRisk, a machine learning-based tool that provides an individual 5-year estimated risk of developing breast cancer based on the patients clinical data and breast density, with or without polygenic risk scores (PRSs). DNA was extracted from saliva samples for genotyping of 76 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The individual risk was communicated to the patient, with individualized screening and prevention recommendations. RESULTS: A total of 290 women underwent breast cancer assessment, among which 196 women (68%) were eligible for risk assessment using MammoRisk (median age 52, range 40C72).

Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four citiesDelhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan.

We evaluated the usage of an eHealth platform by patients who used the platform individually compared with patients in a blended setting, where healthcare professionals were involved. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, log data from September 2011 until January 2018 were extracted from the eHealth platform Curavista. Patients with COPD who completed at least one Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) were included for analyses (n = 299).

We collected patient-level information regarding demographics, public insurance status (Medicare or Medicaid), comorbidities, level of care, and mortality using a structured chart review. We compared demographics and comorbidities of patients who were (1) able to convalesce at home, (2) required admission to general medical service, (3) required admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or (4) died within 30 days of the index visit. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to report adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) with hospital admission versus ED discharge home. Results: In total, 993 patients who presented to the ED with symptoms were included in the analysis with 370 (37.3%) patients requiring hospital admission and 70 (7.1%) patients requiring ICU care. Patients requiring admission were more likely to be Black or African American, to be Hispanic or Latino, or to have public insurance (either Medicaid or Medicare.)

The questionnaire included self-reported information on lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, eating habits, smoking, watching television, social media use and sleep before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 5896 participants were included in the final analysis and 62.8% were females. The BMI of the participants was 25.4  5.8 kg/m(2). Around 38.4% of the participants stopped practicing any physical activities during the confinement (P < 0.001), and 57.1% reported spending more than 2 h on social media (P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in smoking habits. Also, 30.9% reported an improvement in their eating habits compared with 24.8% reported worsening of their eating habits. Fast-food consumption decreased significantly in 48.8% of the study population.

While biopolitics aims to ameliorate the health of populations, Foucault never systematically accounted for the unequal value of lives. In the name of saving the biological lives of people who use drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic, the harm reduction movement has emphasized the need for safe supply, decriminalization, and housing; governments have started implementing these measures, which were previously rejected as utopian and unrealistic. Paradoxically, the use of drugs itself, and therefore the increased risk of death from overdose or other medical sequelae, is the only way PWUD can achieve enough visibility to be recognized as a life worth saving. The humanitarian rationale of harm reduction concerns itself with the biological life and stipulates social and political rights in the name of its sacredness.

Deviations from the physiologically relevant mechanical stretch are often associated with organ dysfunction and various diseases. Although mechanical stretch is provided in some in vitro cell culture models, the effects of stretch dimensionality on cells are often overlooked and it remains unclear whether and how stretch dimensionality affects cell behavior. Here we develop cell culture platforms that provide 1-D uniaxial, 2-D circumferential, or 3-D radial mechanical stretches, which recapitulate the three major types of mechanical stretches that cells experience in vivo. We investigate the behavior of human microvascular endothelial cells and human alveolar epithelial cells cultured on these platforms, showing that the mechanical stretch influences cell morphology and cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions in a stretch dimensionality-dependent manner. Furthermore, the endothelial and epithelial cells are sensitive to the physiologically relevant 2-D and 3-D stretches, respectively, which could promote the formation of endothelium and epithelium.

Using a national sample of adults with MS in the United States obtained early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the current study aimed to: (1) assess willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine when available; (2) determine demographic, MS, and psychosocial correlates of vaccine willingness; and (3) measure where people with MS get their COVID-19 information and their perceived trustworthiness of such sources, which may influence COVID-19 vaccine willingness. METHODS: Adults with MS (N = 486) living in the United States completed a cross-sectional online survey (between 10 April 2020 and 06 May 2020) about their willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination once available. Participants also completed measures to describe the sample and to assess factors potentially related to vaccine willingness, including demographics, MS-specific variables, psychological measures, COVID-19 information sources, and perceived trustworthiness of their information sources. RESULTS: Approximately two-thirds of the participants (66.0%) reported a willingness to obtain a future COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 15.4%of the sample was unwilling. Greater willingness to receive the vaccine was associated with having a higher level of education and holding a higher perception of one's risk of catching COVID-19. Participants reported accessing COVID-19 information from many different sources. Approximately a third (31.6%) of the sample reported getting their information from healthcare providers. Healthcare providers and the National MS Society had the highest perceived trustworthiness for COVID-19 information. The perceived trustworthiness of information sources was highly associated with vaccine willingness. CONCLUSION: Early in the pandemic, willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was not universal in this large sample or people living with MS. Vaccine willingness was associated with a few variables including education level, perceived risk for COVID-19 infection, and trust in COVID-19 information sources. These results have important implications for guiding healthcare providers and the MS community as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available.","output":"Willingness to obtain COVID-19 vaccination in adults with multiple sclerosis in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social factors that determine the health of a population are known as the social determinants of health.

The financial costs of screening assays have been described, but the human resource requirements at the school and district level to implement a SARS-CoV-2 screening program are not well known. ObjectiveTo quantify the resources required to implement a screening program in K-12 schools. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA consortium of Massachusetts public K-12 schools was formed to implement and evaluate a range of SARS-CoV-2 screening approaches. Participating districts were surveyed weekly about their programs, including: type of assay used, individual vs. pooled screening, approaches to return of results and deconvolution (identification of positive individual specimens) of positive pools, number and type of personnel implementing the screening program, and hours spent on program implementation. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCosts, resource utilization ResultsIn 21 participating districts, over 21 weeks from January to June 2021, the positivity rate was 0.0%-0.21% among students and 0.0%-0.13% among educators/staff, and 4 out of 21 (19%) districts had at least one classroom transition to remote learning at any point due to a positive case. The average weekly cost to implement a screening program, including assay and personnel costs, was $17.00 per person tested; this was $46.68 for individual screenings and $15.61 for pooled screenings. The total weekly costs by district ranged from $1,644-$93,486, and districts screened between 58 and 3,675 people per week.

However, the unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak caused a disruption of the current practices and treatment guidelines. Therefore, it is highly likely that the pandemic had its disruptive effect on any educational interventions that were going on during the outbreak. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention in improving antimicrobial agents prescribing. METHODOLOGY: This was a randomized controlled study that included 69 resident physicians in a teaching hospital. The intervention group received an educational intervention focusing on antimicrobial agents prescribing and resistance. Before and after the intervention, outpatient antimicrobial agents prescribing rates for the two study arms were compared for the pre- and post-intervention periods. Additionally, all participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire that measured their knowledge, attitudes and behavioral intention towards antimicrobial agents resistance and prescription. The post-intervention period included the months of February, March, and June 2020. April and May were excluded from the study period since clinics were closed due to the COVID -19 pandemic. RESULTS: Post-intervention, the rate of antimicrobial agents prescribing by the intervention group was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.001). Mean fear score for the intervention group was significantly lower than that for the control group after the intervention.

A laparoscopic approach to the peritoneal cavity was employed in rectal mobilization; this was followed by a transanal rectorectal intussusception and pull-through (IPT). IPT was established in a stepwise fashion. First, the proximal margin of resection was attached to the shaft of the anvil of an end-to-end circular stapler with a ligature around the rectum. Second, this complex was pulled transanally to produce IPT. Once IPT was established, a second ligature was placed around the rectum approximating the proximal and distal resection margins. This was followed by a purse string suture through 2 bowel walls, encircling the shaft of the anvil just proximal to the ligatures. The specimen was resected and extracted by making a full-thickness incision through the 2 bowel walls distal to the previously placed purse string suture and ligatures. The anastomosis was achieved by applying the stapler. The technique was found to be feasible. Peritoneal samples, collected after transanal specimen extraction, did not demonstrate bacterial growth.

Methods All first-year emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians at a single university hospital underwent a crossover randomized controlled trial to receive mastery-learning eFAST training either at the beginning of the academic year or 6 months into intern year. Participants were taught using a checklist validated by a panel of experts using Mastery Angoff methods and were given feedback on missed tasks until each trainee completed the eFAST with a minimum passing standard (MPS).

They must consider the immediate clinical needs of those in the present, and how their actions will impact on future patients. The good medical practice guidance 'Make the care of your patient your first concern' provides no guidance on how doctors should act when they care for multiple patients with conflicting needs. Moreover, conflicting needs extend far past simply those between different patients. At an organisational level, financial obligations must be balanced with clinical ones; the system must support those who work within it in a variety of roles; and, finally, in order for a healthcare service to be sustainable, the demands of current and future generations must be balanced.The central problem, we propose, is that there is no shared philosophical framework on which the provision of care or the development of health policy is based, nor is there a practical, fair and transparent process to ensure that the service is equipped to deal justly with new challenges as they emerge. Many philosophers have grappled with constructing a set of principles which would lead to a 'good' society which is just to different users; prominent among them is Rawls.Four important principles can be derived using a Rawlsian approach: equity of access, distributive justice, sustainability and openness. However, Rawls' approach is sometimes considered too abstract to be applied readily to policymaking; it does not provide clear guidance for how individuals working within existing institutions can enact the principles of justice. We therefore combine the principles derived from Rawls with Scanlonian contractualism: by demanding that decisions are made in a way which cannot be 'reasonably rejected' by different stakeholders (including 'trustees' for those who cannot represent themselves), we ensure that conflicting needs are considered robustly.We demonstrate how embedding this framework would ensure just policies and fair practice. We illustrate this by using examples of how it would help prevent injustice among different socioeconomic groups, prevent intergenerational injustice and prevent injustice in a crisis, for example, as we respond to new challenges such as COVID-19.Attempts to help individual doctors practise fairly and justly throughout their professional lives are best focused at an institutional or systemic level. We propose a practical framework: combining Scanlonian contractualism with a Rawlsian approach. Adopting this framework would equip the workforce and population to contribute to fair policymaking, and would ultimately result in a healthcare system whose practice and policies-at their core-were just.","output":"Integrating philosophy, policy and practice to create a just and fair health service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. On the announcement of the COVID-19 health emergency, the Marrakesh School of Medicine accelerated the digitization and the establishment of courses available to students through the faculty platform. We aimed to describe the students perspectives toward the online educational approach implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the factors that might affect the implementation of online teaching in the future. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study among medical students in Marrakesh during June-July 2020. Data collection was based on a self-administered electronic questionnaire distributed via the student platform. We studied the knowledge and previous practices of virtual technologies and students appreciation of distance learning during the lockdown. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS16.0 software. Results. A total of 111 students participated. The female-to-male sex ratio was 2.2 with an average age of 20.6  1.8. The majority of students felt that they had a good knowledge of virtual technologies (on a scale of 1 to 10, 81%  5/10), and two-thirds reported using them in medical studies. Before the COVID-19 lockdown, 16.2% of the students used the platform and 39.6% did not attend in-person courses (16.0% in 1st cycle versus 49.2% in 2nd cycle, p=0.01). During the pandemic, 79% of the students appreciated the virtual learning (54.0% in 1st cycle versus 89.0% in 2nd cycle, p&lt;0.001) and 80.2% thought that the online courses were understandable. Regarding to students preferences, 41.4% preferred blended education and 68.5% of the students would recommend continuing distance learning after the pandemic. Regarding satisfaction, previous use of the educational platform (OR = 66.3, CI 95% [1.9;2.2?103]), improvement of learning during distance learning (OR = 22.6, IC 95% [4.1, 123.7]), and professor support (OR = 7, IC95% [1.3, 38]) seemed to be the most powerful factors in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion. Our results will contribute to the implementation of actions by taking advantage of the experience during the health crisis. The institutionalization of virtual learning with more interaction in addition to the in-person courses is the main recommendation of this study.","output":"Implementation of Online Teaching in Medical Education: Lessons Learned from Students Perspectives during the Health Crisis in Marrakesh, Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article traces the diffusion of the 1968 Hong Kong influenza pandemic against the backdrop of scientific and global health developments, a global wave of social protests, and Cold War tensions between the United States and the Peoples Republic of China Although the outbreak was far less severe than the 1918C19 Spanish influenza pandemic, the ease with which influenza spread globally between 1968 and 1970 contributed to a reformulation of global health that emphasized the need for enhanced preparedness and rapid vaccine production From the 1950s through the 1960s, the scope of disease surveillance expanded, with China increasingly identified as the global epicentre of viral threats In so arguing, the article challenges histories of global health that suggest that this was a period when concerns for infectious disease receded, in contrast to the final two decades of the twentieth century that saw the ascendancy of an emerging diseases worldview","output":"Viral surveillance and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The course of periodontal disease is affected by many factors; however, the most significant are the dysbiotic microflora, showing different pathogenicity levels.

The decisive advantage of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique in relation to molecular methods based on the identification of nucleic acids (such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR or qPCR) is the ability to determine more pathogens simultaneously, as well as with higher sensitivity. In comparison with classical microbiological seeding techniques, the use of the LAMP method shortens a few days waiting time to a few minutes, reducing the time necessary to identify the species and determine the number of microorganisms. The LAMP technology requires only a small hardware base; hence it is possible to use it in outpatient settings. The developed technique provides the possibility of almost immediate assessment of periodontal status and, above all, risk assessment of complications during the treatment (uncontrolled spread of inflammation), which can certainly be of key importance in clinical work.","output":"The Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Technique in Periodontal Diagnostics: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The contribution of nurses in a wide variety of roles has demonstrated the depth of the knowledge and skills of our profession during the pandemic, says Crystal Oldman","output":"Making a difference in troubled times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este artigo tem como principal objetivo a anlise do processo de internacionaliza?ao de uma Pequena e Mdia Empresa (PME), dando especial enfase ao relacionamento entre a sede e as suas filiais, o que  pouco estudado no mbito das PMEs.

We sought to knockdown the viral RNA of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) directly by exploiting the CRISPR/Cas13b system. Effective mRNA cleavage by CRISPR/Cas13b-mediated CRISPR RNA (crRNA) targeting the ORF5 and ORF7 genes of PRRSV was observed. To address the need for uniform delivery of the Cas13b protein and crRNAs, an all-in-one system expressing Cas13b and duplexed crRNA cassettes was developed. Delivery of a single vector carrying double crRNAs enabled the simultaneous knockdown of two PRRSV genes. Transgenic MARC-145 cells stably expressing the Cas13b effector and crRNA mediated by lentiviral-based transduction showed a robust ability to splice the PRRSV genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs; viral infection was almost completely abrogated by the combination of double crRNAs simultaneously targeting the ORF5 and ORF7 genes.

BACKGROUND Unprecedented cardiac procedural deferral was implemented nationwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A web-based survey was administered by SCAI and the ACC Interventional Council to cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) directors and interventional cardiologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Among 414 total responses, 48 states and 360 unique cardiac catheterization laboratories were represented, with mean inpatient COVID-19 burden 16.4+21.9%. There was a spectrum of deferral by procedure type, varying by both severity of COVID-19 burden and procedural urgency (p<0.001). Percutaneous coronary intervention volumes dropped by 55% (p<0.0001) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement volumes dropped by 64%, (p=0.004), with cardiologists reporting an increase in late presenting ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarctions and deaths among patients waiting for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Almost 1/3 of catheterization laboratories had at least one interventionalist testing positive for COVID-19. Salary reductions did not influence procedural deferral or speed of reinstituting normal volumes. Pandemic preparedness improved significantly over time, with the most pressing current problems focused on inadequate testing and staff health risks. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, cardiac procedural deferrals were associated with procedural urgency and severity of hospital COVID-19 burden. Yet patients did not appear to be similarly influenced, with cardiologists reporting increases in late presenting ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarctions independent of local COVID-19 burden.

Although these mistakes do not change our general statements, they nevertheless should be corrected (corrections are marked bold). Introduction Despite the urgency of the current Covid19 pandemic, radicalization and extremism continue to be pressing problems throughout the world. According to the Global Terrorism Index, about 16,000 people lost their lives in 2018 as a result of politically or religiously motivated terrorist attacks (Institute for Economics and Peace, 2019). Although these are mainly people from Afghanistan, Nigeria, Iraq, and Syria, problems of radicalization and extremism are still a realistic threat within European societies. For example, about 41,000 politically motivated offenses were registered in Germany in 2019 - an increase of about 14 percent compared to 2018 (BMI, 2020). Of these, about 31,500 offences and 2,800 violent crimes had an explicit extremist background. In addition, more than 30,000 people in each group of right-wing, left-wing, or religious extremists have been observed as suspected cases, and a substantial number of these express a readiness to use violence. These and other data underline the need for effective prevention measures as a prominent future challenge facing the world community. However, when designing and implementing programs, it will be important to do this against the background of scientific knowledge on how radicalization and extremism emerge.

We use covalent docking, to dock these tailored covalent libraries and to find those that can bind covalently to a nearby cysteine while keeping some of the main interactions of the original molecule.

RESULTS: The median age of patients in our cohort was 7.50 (IQR: 2.92C12.17) years, and 133 (57.1%) patients were male. 42 (18.0%) patients were evaluated as asymptomatic, while 162 (69.5%) and 25 (10.7%) patients were classified as mild or moderate, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, longer time to negative RT-PCR was associated with the presence of confirmed infection in family members (HR (95% CI): 0.56 (0.41 to 0.79)).

Our theoretical models unambiguously evidence that the population of CT states is very unlikely in both cases, whereas the light-triggered heat dissipation can be ascribed to the activation of specific vibrational degrees of freedom related to the relative motion of the peripheral chains.

Objective To describe the mucocutaneous findings seen in children with MIS-C during the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in New York City in 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective case series was conducted of 35 children admitted to 2 hospitals in New York City between April 1 and July 14, 2020, who met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or epidemiologic criteria for MIS-C. Main Outcomes and Measures Laboratory and clinical characteristics, with emphasis on mucocutaneous findings, of children who met criteria for MIS-C. The characterization of mucocutaneous features was verified by 2 board-certified pediatric dermatologists. Results Twenty-five children (11 girls [44%]; median age, 3 years [range, 0.7-17 years]) were identified who met definitional criteria for MIS-C; an additional 10 children (5 girls [50%]; median age, 1.7 years [range, 0.2-15 years]) were included as probable MIS-C cases (patients met all criteria with the exception of laboratory test evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection or known exposure). The results of polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive for 10 patients (29%), and the results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G tests were positive for 19 patients (54%). Of the 35 patients, 29 (83%) exhibited mucocutaneous changes, with conjunctival injection (n = 21), palmoplantar erythema (n = 18), lip hyperemia (n = 17), periorbital erythema and edema (n = 7), strawberry tongue (n = 8), and malar erythema (n = 6) being the most common findings. Recognition of mucocutaneous findings occurred a mean of 2.7 days (range, 1-7 days) after the onset of fever. The duration of mucocutaneous findings varied from hours to days (median duration, 5 days [range, 0-11 days]). Neither the presence nor absence of mucocutaneous findings was significantly associated with overall disease severity. Conclusions and Relevance In this case series of hospitalized children with suspected MIS-C during the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide spectrum of mucocutaneous findings was identified. Despite their protean and transient nature, these mucocutaneous features serve as important clues in the recognition of MIS-C.","output":"Mucocutaneous Manifestations of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Land\\\\use change and politicalCeconomic shifts have shaped hunting patterns globally, even as traditional hunting practices endure across many local socio\\\\cultural contexts.

Additionally, 17 of 38 huntersincluding 71% (10/14) of hunters who started hunting before 1985, compared to 26% (6/23) of hunters who started hunting in 1985 or latermentioned that bearded pigs are behaving in a more skittish or fearful way as compared to the past. Our respondents also reported reductions in hunting frequency and wild meat consumption in urban contexts as compared to rural contexts.However, despite these substantial changes in hunting and dietary practices, numerous KDM hunting motivations, hunting techniques and socio\\\\cultural traditions have endured over the last several decades. For some, bearded pig meat remains deeply tied to food provision, gifting and sharing customs, and cultural components of celebrations and feasts.Oil palm has cultivated new hunting practices that differ from those in forests, and has potentially contributed to altered bearded pig behaviour due to increased hunting accessibility. Together, oil palm and urbanization are helping reshape the KDM\\\\bearded pig socio\\\\ecological system. In light of these reshaped connections, we recommend location\\\\specific management approaches that ensure fair access to the dietary and social benefits of bearded pig hunting while preserving the critical conservation needs of bearded pig populations and habitat. These twin goals are particularly urgent given the confirmed outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF), and mass deaths of domestic pigs and wild bearded pigs, in Sabah and Kalimantan in 2021.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.","output":"Transformation and endurance of Indigenous hunting: Kadazandusun\\\\Murut bearded pig hunting practices amidst oil palm expansion and urbanization in Sabah, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the 2020 Lunar New Year, the Chinese government implemented a strict nationwide lockdown to inhibit the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This paradox has attracted the attention of both the public and the scientific community. By analyzing comprehensive measurements of air pollutants, planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, and surface meteorology, we show that the severe air pollution episode over northern China coincided with the abnormally low PBL height, which had reduced by 45%, triggering strong aerosol-PBL interactions. After dynamical processes initiated the temperature inversion, the Beijing metropolitan area experienced a period with continuously shallow PBLs during the lockdown.

Concomitant RCCs in a native and transplant kidneys are very rare. Conventional surgical approach requires a long incision. METHODS A 50-year-old man 14 years after renal transplant was found incidentally to have concomitant RCCs in his native right kidney and transplant kidney. A right lower abdomen Gibson incision, along his transplant wound, was used initially for LESS right radical nephrectomy and lymphadenectomy, and that same wound was used for a nonischemic open partial nephrectomy in the transplant kidney. RESULTS The LESS right radical nephrectomy took 3.25 hours with estimated blood loss (EBL) of 80 mL and the partial nephrectomy for the transplant kidney took 3 hours with EBL of 220 mL. No transfusion was required. Pathologic examination revealed both tumors to be RCC, clear cell type, and 6.5 cm in the right native kidney and 2.8 cm in the transplant kidney. The final wound measured 9 cm. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with inpatient narcotic requirement of 37 mg morphine sulfate equivalent, and oral intake of food resumed in 2.5 days. His allograft function was well preserved with a serum creatinine unchanged (1.4 mg/dL) at discharge. CONCLUSION In a patient with concomitant tumors in a native kidney and a transplant kidney, this unique approach provides exceptional benefits of minimally invasive tumor excision for both tumors, and good preservation of renal function.","output":"Simultaneous laparoendoscopic single-site radical nephrectomy for native kidney and open nonischemic partial nephrectomy to treat concomitant renal cell carcinomas in native and transplant kidneys and to preserve allograft function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.

Mutagenesis analyses revealed that a G446S mutation, located just outside the N-terminus of the cognate epitope, augmented TCR recognition of this variant. In contrast, no enhanced suppression of replication was observed against cells infected with the prototype, Omicron BA.2, and Delta variants that express G446. The enhancing effect of the G446S mutation was lost when target cells were treated with inhibitors of tripeptidyl peptidase II, a protein that mediates antigen processing.

Overall, 705,883 subjects were vaccinated by Pandemrix, Arepanrix, and Panenza. The adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) data comparison was made with the 2014/2015 seasonal influenza vaccination campaign that was specifically investigated. AIM: To evaluate the safety of the 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine and to compare it to that of 2014 seasonal influenza vaccine. METHODS: During the pandemic vaccination campaign, the Morocco Pharmacovigilance Centre reinforced passive AEFI surveillance with an active and prospective monitoring programme of 1000 immunized people over 6 months at 10 randomly selected vaccination centres. For the 2014/2015 seasonal vaccination campaign, AEFI data were collected from spontaneous notifications. RESULTS: Active monitoring of 2009 pandemic collected 771 AEFI reports, corresponding to an AEFI incidence rate of 77.1% with vaccination by either Pandemrix or Arepanrix vaccine in 95% of cases. Reported AEFI were most frequently local (37.7%), general (29.5%), and neurological reactions (20.3%). Most of the AEFI (95.5%) were observed during the first 48 hours after vaccination, and the remainder within 2 weeks. None of the reported AEFI were serious case. The highest rate of notification was documented for health professionals, followed by patients with diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases. Concerning passive surveillance, the AEFI notification rate was significantly higher for the 2009/2010 pandemic vaccine (3.1 vs 1.2 per 10,000). However, there was no significant difference between pandemic and seasonal vaccination with regards to the serious adverse events (SAE) notification rate (0.3 vs 0.2 per 10,000).

METHODS: This study is a quasi-experiment study. The study population was patients who visited all 402 EDs in Korea between December 31, 2019 and May 13, 2020, using the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database. The study period was classified into 5 phases according to the level of national crisis warning of infectious disease and the implementation of emergency care-related health policies, and all study phases were 27 days. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcome was length of stay (LOS) in the ED during the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The number of ED visits during the study period was 2,636,341, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.4%. The number of ED visits decreased from 803,160 in phase 1 to 496,619 in phase 5 during the study period. For in-hospital mortality, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) was 0.77 (0.74C0.79) in phase 5 compared to phase 3. Additionally, by subgroup, the ORs were 0.69 (0.57C0.83) for the patients with acute myocardial infarction and 0.76 (0.67C0.87) for severe trauma in phase 5 compared to phase 3.

The objectives of this research include the questions (1) how was the issue of DV presented in the Pakistani media during the lockdown period? and (2) what messages were conveyed by the media discourses? A summative qualitative content analysis was used as a method for data collection and analysis.

Methods: We compared four strategies against gHAT by coupling a transmission model with a health outcomes model in five settings -- spanning low- to high-risk. Alongside passive surveillance (PS) in fixed health facilities, the strategies included active screening (AS) at average or high coverage levels, both alone or with vector control (VC). A scale-back algorithm was devised to simulate cessation of AS and VC when no cases were reported for three consecutive years. Outcomes were denominated in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and costs until 2040 were denominated in 2018 US$. Results: In high or moderate-risk settings, costs of gHAT strategies are primarily driven by AS and, if used, VC. Due to the cessation of AS and VC most investments (75-80%) will be made by 2030 and VC might be cost-saving while ensuring EOT. In low-risk settings, costs are driven by PS, and minimum-cost strategies consisting of AS and PS lead to EOT by 2030 with high probability. Conclusion: In many settings, the case for EOT by 2030 is a sensible use of resources, and investments in gHAT will decelerate within this decade in moderate- and low-risk regions.","output":"Economic evaluation of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis elimination campaigns in five distinct transmission settings in the Democratic Republic of Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted health services throughout the world. It has brought in several new challenges to deal with surgical emergencies. Herein, we report two suspected cases of COVID-19 that were operated during this lockdown period and highlight the protocols we followed and lessons we learned from this situation. Result Two patients from red zones for COVID-19 pandemic presented with acute abdomen, one a 64-year male, who presented with perforation peritonitis and another, a 57-year male with acute intestinal obstruction due to sigmoid volvulus. They also had associated COVID-19 symptoms. COVID-19 test could not be done at the time of their presentation to the hospital. Patients underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy assuming them to be positive for the infection. Surgical team was donned with full coverall personal protective equipment. Sudden and uncontrolled egression intraperitoneal free gas was avoided, Echelon flex 60 staplers were used to resect the volvulus without allowing the gas from the volvulus to escape; mesocolon was divided using vascular reload of the stapler, no electrosurgical devices were used to avoid the aerosolization of viral particles. Colostomy was done in both the patients. Both the patients turned out to be negative for COVID-19 subsequently and discharged from hospital in stable condition.

We conducted a review of efficacy and effectiveness studies to ascertain the effect of zinc fortification [postharvest fortification of an industrially produced food or beverage; alone or with multiple micronutrients (MMN)] on a range of health outcomes. Previous reviews have required that the effect of zinc be isolated; because zinc is always cofortified with MMN in existing fortification programs, we did not impose this condition. Outcomes assessed were zinc-related biomarkers (plasma or serum, hair or urine zinc concentrations, comet assay, plasma fatty acid concentrations, and the proportion of and total zinc absorbed in the intestine from the diet), child anthropometry, morbidity, mortality, cognition, plasma or serum iron and copper concentrations, and for observational studies, a change in consumption of the food vehicle. Fifty-nine studies were included in the review; 54 in meta-analyses, totaling 73 comparisons. Zinc fortification with and without MMN increased plasma zinc concentrations (efficacy, n = 27: 4.68 g/dL; 95% CI: 2.62-6.75; effectiveness, n = 13: 6.28 g/dL; 95% CI: 5.03-7.77 g/dL) and reduced the prevalence of zinc deficiency (efficacy, n = 11: OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60-0.96; effectiveness, n = 10: OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.31-0.64).

This study aimed to evaluate the value of COVID-19 antibody rapid test assessment in emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in Tehran, Iran from 20th March until 20th May 2020. The results of chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and antibody rapid test were compared in EMS personnel with confirmed COVID-19, as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic ones who had exposure to a probable/confirmed COVID-19 teammate. In symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals who were only IgM-positive, chest CT scan or RT-PCR was recommended. Results A total of 243 EMS personnel with the mean age of 36.148.70 (range 21 to 59) years took part in this study (87.7% were males). Most of the participants (73.3%) had history of exposure. One hundred sixty-three EMS personnel were tested using either RT-PCR test or chest CT-scan or both, and 78 (47.9%) of them had at least one positive result. Among the participants who had undergone chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test (n=163), 78 had positive chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test; of these, 18 individuals had negative results for IgM and IgG. The rate of positive IgM and IgG in participants with positive chest CT-scan was 1.6 or 1.3 times more than those with negative chest CT-scan, respectively (p < 0.05). The percentage of positive results for both IgM and IgG in participants having positive RT-PCR test was 1.7 times more than those having negative RT-PCR test (p < 0.05). Conclusion Rapid antibody test could help in diagnosis of COVID-19 in asymptomatic or symptomatic EMS personnel who did not undergo RT-PCR test or the test was reported as negative.

Intrauterine viral infections induce an increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, which inhibit the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells and stimulate oligodendrocyte cell death, leading to abnormal neurodevelopment. Whether a maternal cytokine storm can affect neonatal brain development is unclear. The objective of the present study is to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy. MethodsIn this prospective cohort study, the neurodevelopment status of infants (N=298) born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy was assessed at 10-12 months post discharge using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3). The ASQ-3 scores were classified into developmental delays (cutoff score: []2 standard deviations (SDs) below the population mean) and no delay (score >2 SDs above the population mean). ResultsApproximately 10% of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy showed developmental delays. Two of 298 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and both had normal ASQ-3 scores. The majority of the pregnant women had SARS-CoV-2 infection during their third trimester. The risk of developmental delays among infants was higher in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the first (P=0.039) and second trimesters (P=0.001) than in those whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the third trimester. Infants born at <31 weeks gestation were more prone to developmental delays than those born at >31 weeks gestation (10% versus 0.8%; P=0.002).

However, few studies have explored healthcare workers views about their use in febrile children. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of hospital-based doctors and nurses regarding the use of POCTs in England. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative in-depth interviews with purposively selected hospital doctors and nurses. Data were analysed thematically. SETTING: Two university teaching hospitals in London and Newcastle. PARTICIPANTS: 24 participants (paediatricians, emergency department doctors, trainee paediatricians and nurses). RESULTS: There were diverse views about the use of POCTs in febrile children. The reported advantages included their ease of use and the rapid availability of results. They were seen to contribute to faster clinical decision-making; the targeting of antibiotic use; improvements in patient care, flow and monitoring; cohorting (ie, the physical clustering of hospitalised patients with the same infection to limit spread) and enhancing communication with parents. These advantages were less evident when the turnaround for results of laboratory tests was 1C2 hours. Factors such as clinical experience and specialty, as well as the availability of guidelines recommending POCT use, were also perceived as influential. However, in addition to their perceived inaccuracy, participants were concerned about POCTs not resolving diagnostic uncertainty or altering clinical management, leading to a commonly expressed preference for relying on clinical skills rather than test results solely. CONCLUSION: In this study conducted at two university teaching hospitals in England, participants expressed mixed opinions about the utility of current POCTs in the management of febrile children. Understanding the current clinical decision-making process and the specific needs and preferences of clinicians in different settings will be critical in ensuring the optimal design and deployment of current and future tests.","output":"Role of point-of-care tests in the management of febrile children: a qualitative study of hospital-based doctors and nurses in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented global health crisis, with several countries imposing lockdowns to control the coronavirus spread Important research efforts are focused on evaluating the association of environmental factors with the survival and spread of the virus and different works have been published, with contradictory results in some cases Data with spatial and temporal information is a key factor to get reliable results and, although there are some data repositories for monitoring the disease both globally and locally, an application that integrates and aggregates data from meteorological and air quality variables with COVID-19 information has not been described so far to the best of our knowledge Here, we present DatAC (Data Against COVID-19), a data fusion project with an interactive web frontend that integrates COVID-19 and environmental data in Spain DatAC is provided with powerful data analysis and statistical capabilities that allow users to explore and analyze individual trends and associations among the provided data Using the application, we have evaluated the impact of the Spanish lockdown on the air quality, observing that NO2, CO, PM2 5, PM10 and SO2 levels decreased drastically in the entire territory, while O3 levels increased We observed similar trends in urban and rural areas, although the impact has been more important in the former Moreover, the application allowed us to analyze correlations among climate factors, such as ambient temperature, and the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain Our results indicate that temperature is not the driving factor and without effective control actions, outbreaks will appear and warm weather will not substantially limit the growth of the pandemic DatAC is available at https://covid19 genyo es","output":"DatAC: A visual analytics platform to explore climate and air quality indicators associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused >20 million infections and >750,000 deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been found closely related to the bat coronavirus strain RaTG13 (Bat-CoV RaTG13) and a recently identified pangolin coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV-2020). Here, we first investigated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and three related coronaviruses to utilize animal orthologs of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry. We found that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild mammals, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, cats, rabbits, and pangolins, were able to support cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that these species might be able to harbor and spread this virus. In addition, the pangolin and bat coronaviruses, Pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV RaTG13, were also found able to utilize human ACE2 and a number of animal-ACE2 orthologs for cell entry, indicating risks of spillover of these viruses into humans in the future. We then developed potently anticoronavirus ACE2-Ig proteins that are broadly effective against the four distinct coronaviruses. In particular, through truncating ACE2 at its residue 740 but not 615, introducing a D30E mutation, and adopting an antibody-like tetrameric-ACE2 configuration, we generated an ACE2-Ig variant that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 at picomolar range. These data demonstrate that the improved ACE2-Ig variants developed in this study could potentially be developed to protect from SARS-CoV-2 and some other SARS-like viruses that might spillover into humans in the future. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of the currently uncontrolled coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is important to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2, because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. In this study, we found that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild animals can support cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 and three related coronaviruses, providing insights into identifying animal hosts of these viruses. We also developed recombinant ACE2-Ig proteins that are able to potently block these viral infections, providing a promising approach to developing antiviral proteins broadly effective against these distinct coronaviruses.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and Three Related Coronaviruses Utilize Multiple ACE2 Orthologs and Are Potently Blocked by an Improved ACE2-Ig"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, linear regression (LR), multi-linear regression (MLR) and polynomial regression (PR) techniques are applied to propose a model Li-MuLi-Poly.

While numerous studies have shown that both patients and parents in these families can experience a variety of challenges and concerns, the experience of siblings is less well understood. The focus of this scoping review was on research addressing the experiences and well-being of siblings of children with CKD. METHODS: Following scoping review methodology, five databases were searched for peer-reviewed research or graduate theses published in English that addressed the experience or well-being of siblings aged 25 years or younger (biological, step or foster) of children with CKD; studies from any year or location were included. Two independent coders identified relevant studies. Findings were summarized and synthesized. RESULTS: Of the 2990 studies identified, 19 were chosen for full text review and eight fit the inclusion criteria. Five of the selected studies were qualitative, two were quantitative and one used mixed-methods. Four broad themes across studies were identified including family functioning, significant relationships, psychological well-being, and coping strategies. While there was some convergence between qualitative and quantitative findings, these linkages were weak. CONCLUSIONS: Several unmet needs of siblings were uncovered by this review. Sibling perceptions of differential parental treatment and desire for information about CKD emerged as priorities for practice. Using a strength-based approach in order to better understand sibling experiences and well-being was also recommended for future research.

The modification is often crucial for the proteins function and hence for virus replication. Transfer of fatty acids is mediated by one or several of the 23 members of the ZDHHC family of proteins. Since their genes are linked to various human diseases, they represent drug targets.Areas covered: The authors explore whether targeting acylation of viral proteins might be a strategy to combat viral diseases. Many human pathogens contain S-acylated proteins; the ZDHHCs involved in their acylation are currently identified. Based on the 3D structure of two ZDHHCs, the regulation and the biochemistry of the palmitolyation reaction and the lipid and protein substrate specificities are discussed. The authors then speculate how ZDHHCs might recognize S-acylated membrane proteins of Influenza virus.Expert opinion: Although many viral diseases can now be treated, the available drugs bind to viral proteins that rapidly mutate and become resistant. To develop inhibitors for the genetically more stable cellular ZDHHCs, their binding sites for viral substrates need to be identified. If only a few cellular proteins are recognized by the same binding site, development of specific inhibitors may have therapeutic potential.","output":"Toward the identification of ZDHHC enzymes required for palmitoylation of viral protein as potential drug targets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has affected the population worldwide, evidencing new challenges and opportunities for several kinds of emergent and existing technologies.

Experimental models that simulate the spread of infectious diseases are thus crucial to the inception of effective control policies. Current models have had great success incorporating virulence and host immune response but do rarely take host genetics, behavior and host environment into account. Here, we present a full-scale imaging setup that utilizes the infection of the nematode C. elegans with a positive-stranded RNA virus (Orsay Virus) to probe key epidemiological parameters and simulate the spread of infection in a whole population. We demonstrate that our system is able to quantify infection levels and host behavior at a high sampling rate and show that different host genetic backgrounds can influence viral spread, while also highlighting the influence of infection on various host behaviors. Future work will allow the isolation of key behavioral and environmental factors that affect viral spread, potentially enabling novel policies to combat the spread of viral infections. Significance Statement In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we struggle to find effective control policies that stop the spread. While current animal models of virus spread in populations are highly sophisticated, they rarely explore effects of host behavior and its environment. We developed an experimental animal model system that allows us to visualize virus transmission in whole populations of C. elegans while also measuring behaviors. We were able to demonstrate how C. elegans genetics influences the progression of viral infection in a population and how animals adjust their behavior when infected. In the future, we envision that animal model systems like ours are used to test the effects of viral control policies on viral spread before they are applied in real world scenarios.","output":"The Orsay Virus as a model for population-wide viral infection dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There is no evidence-based treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia and was treated with convalescent plasma. CASE REPORT A 63-year-old woman who presented with severe and prolonged course of COVID-19 disease (fever up to 39.4C, persistent cough, and dyspnea) received a convalescent plasma transfusion, which led to complete recovery. The diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR testing using the CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, USA) from nasopharyngeal swabs. In laboratory tests, an increase in acute-phase parameters was observed. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed abnormalities typical for COVID-19. On days 9 and 11 of the disease, she received the convalescent plasma prepared from a single plasmapheresis donation from a male donor. This male donor was qualified as a convalescent plasma donor according to Polish guidelines, which are compliant with European guidelines. He donated plasma at the Regional Centre for Transfusion Medicine in Bialystok, Poland. The therapy with convalescent plasma led to clinical improvement and normalization of inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSIONS This report presents a case of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a 63-year-old woman who was given supportive treatment with convalescent plasma. Ongoing clinical trials will determine whether convalescent plasma therapy is an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"A 63-Year-Old Woman with SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Who Developed Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia and Was Supported with Convalescent Plasma Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a poorly understood disease involving a high inflammatory status. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as a new pathway to contain infectious diseases but can also participate in the imbalance of the inflammatory and the coagulation systems. NETs could be a therapeutic target in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Consecutive patients with SARS-CoV2 related pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit were included in a prospective bicentric study. Neutrophil extracellular trap concentrations were quantified in whole blood samples at day-1 and day-3 by flow cytometry. The primary outcome was the association between the blood NET quantification at ICU admission and the number of days with refractory hypoxemia defined by a PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio 100 mmHg. Results: Among 181 patients admitted to the ICUs for acute respiratory failure related to SARS-CoV2 pneumonia, 58 were included in the analysis. Patients were 62 [54, 69] years old in median, mostly male (75.9%). The median number of days with severe hypoxemia was 4 [2, 6] days and day-28 mortality was 27.6% (n = 16). The blood level of NETs significantly decreased between day-1 and day-3 in patients who survived (59.5 [30.5, 116.6] to 47 [33.2, 62.4] p = 0.006; 8.6 [3.4, 18.0] to 4 [1.4, 10.7] p = 0.001 and 7.4 [4.0, 16.7] to 2.6 [1.0, 8.3] p = 0.001 for MPO+, Cit-H3+, and MPO+ Cit-H3+ NETs, respectively) while it remained stable in patients who died (38.4 [26.0, 54.8] to 44.5 [36.4, 77.7] p = 0.542; 4.9 [1.3, 13.0] to 5.5 [2.8, 6.9] p = 0.839 and 4 [1.3, 13.6] to 2.7 [1.4, 4.5] p = 0.421 for MPO+, Cit-H3+, and MPO+ Cit-H3+ NETs, respectively). In multivariable negative binomial regression, the blood level of MPO+ NETs was negatively associated with the number of days with severe hypoxemia within 7 days (0.84 [0.73, 0.97]), while neither Cit-H3+ NETs nor double-positive NETs were significantly associated with the primary outcome. Conclusion: The whole blood level of NETs at day-1 was negatively associated with the number of days with severe hypoxemia in patients admitted to the intensive care unit for SARS-CoV2 related pneumonia. The lack of decrease of the blood level of NETs between day-1 and day-3 discriminated patients who died within day-28.","output":"Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in SARS-CoV2 Related Pneumonia in ICU Patients: The NETCOV2 Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zoonotically transmitted coronaviruses were responsible for three disease outbreaks since 2002, with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the dramatic Coronavirus Disease-2019 (CoViD-19) pandemic, which affected public health, economy, and society on a global scale. The impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic permeate into our environment and wildlife as well; in particular, concern has been raised about the viral occurrence and persistence in aquatic and marine ecosystems. The discharge of untreated wastewaters carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home of sea mammals may have dramatic consequences on vulnerable species. The efficient transmission of coronaviruses raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptors interactions. The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), serving as a functional receptor for the viral spike (S) protein. This study was aimed, through the comparative analysis of the ACE-2 receptor with the human one, at assessing the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of the different species of marine mammals living in Italian waters. We also determined, by means of immunohistochemistry, ACE-2 receptor localization in the lung tissue from different cetacean species, in order to provide a preliminary characterization of ACE-.2 expression in the marine mammals respiratory tract. Furthermore, in order to evaluate if and how wastewater management in Italy may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus, geo-mapping data of wastewater plants, associated to the identification of specific stretches of coast more exposed to extreme weather events, overlapped to marine mammal population data, were carried out. Results showed the SARS-CoV-2 exposure for marine mammals inhabiting Italian coastal waters. Thus, we highlight the potential hazard of reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its impact on marine mammals regularly inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, whilst also stressing the need of appropriate action to prevent further damage to specific vulnerable populations. Significance Statement Growing concern exists that SARS-CoV-2, as already ascertained for its SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV predecessors, originated from an animal reservoir, performing thereafter its spillover into mankind, that was possibly anticipated by viral passage into a secondary animal host. Within the dramatic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic context, hitherto characterized by over 110 million cases and almost 2,500,000 deaths on a global scale, several domestic and wild animal species have been reported as susceptible to natural and/or experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this respect, while some marine mammal species are deemed as potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection on the basis of the sequence homology of their ACE-2 viral receptor with the human one, this study addresses such a critical issue also in stranded sea mammal specimens.","output":"SARS-CoV2, a threat to marine mammals?

Hence, increases in VP1-specific IgG and in allergen-specific IgE may serve as biomarkers for RV infections or allergen exposure. The MeDALL-allergen chip containing comprehensive panels of allergens and the PreDicta RV chip equipped with VP1-derived peptides, representative of three genetic RV species, were used to measure allergen-specific IgE levels and RV-species-specific IgG levels in sera obtained from 120 preschool children at the time of an acute wheezing attack and convalescence. Nearly 20% of the children (22/120) showed specific IgE sensitizations to at least one of the allergen molecules on the MeDALL chip. For 87% of the children, increases in RV-specific IgG could be detected in the follow-up sera. This percentage of RV-specific IgG increases was equal in IgE-positive and -negative children. In 10% of the children, increases or de novo appearances of IgE sensitizations indicative of allergen exposure could be detected. Our results suggest that, in the majority of preschool children, RV infections trigger wheezing attacks, but, in addition, allergen exposure seems to play a role as a trigger factor. RV-induced wheezing attacks occur in IgE-sensitized and non-IgE-sensitized children, indicating that allergic sensitization is not a prerequisite for RV-induced wheeze.","output":"Microarray Technology May Reveal the Contribution of Allergen Exposure and Rhinovirus Infections as Possible Triggers for Acute Wheezing Attacks in Preschool Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological interventions aim to control the spread of infectious disease through various mechanisms, each carrying a different associated cost.

Questions important for the management of patients with COVID-19 were identified and discussed, and recommendations or statements on these topics were formulated in a structured consensus process. RESULTS Determination of the indication for the admission of COVID-19 patients to the hospital should involve consideration of age, comorbidities, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Every patient admitted without a recent PCR test should be tested immediately. It is recommended that any COVID-19 patient with hypoxemia (SpO2 <90%) despite being given oxygen, dyspnea, or a high respiratory rate be admitted to intensive care. In the case of hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, an attempt at treatment with high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation is suggested, while patients with severe hypoxemia/high respiratory rate should undergo intubation and invasive ventilation. In the presence of additional risk factors (such as obesity, known thrombophilia, intensive care treatment, or elevated D-dimers), intensified prophylaxis against thromboembolism may be indicated.

When close others misbehave, it generates a powerful conflict between observers' moral values and their cherished relationships. Previous research has almost exclusively studied moral perception in a social vacuum by investigating responses to the transgressions of strangers; therefore, little is known about how these responses unfold in the context of intimate bonds. Here we systematically examine the impact of having a close relationship with a transgressor on perceptions of that transgressor, the relationship, and the self. We predicted less negative emotional and evaluative responses to transgressors and smaller consequences for the relationship, yet more negative emotional and evaluative responses to the self when close others, compared with strangers or acquaintances, transgress. Participants read hypothetical wrongdoings (Study 1), recalled unethical events (Study 2), reported daily transgressions (Study 3; preregistered), and learned of novel immoral behavior (Study 4) committed by close others or comparison groups. Participants reported less other-critical emotions, more lenient moral evaluations, a reduced desire to punish/criticize, and a smaller impact on the relationship (compared with acquaintances) when close others versus strangers or acquaintances transgressed. Simultaneously, participants reported more self-conscious emotions and showed some evidence of harsher moral self-evaluations when close others transgressed. Underlying mechanisms of this process were examined. Our findings demonstrate the deep ambivalence in reacting to close others' unethical behaviors, revealing a surprising irony-in protecting close others, the self may bear some of the burden of their misbehavior.

MATERIALS AND METHODS For the study, variations in the interacting residues of spike protein (S-Protein) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different coronaviruses were examined. The MD simulation trajectory analysis revealed that, though all the variants studied were structurally stable at their native and bound confirmations, the RBD of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 was found to be more flexible and more dynamic. Furthermore, a noticeable change observed in the non-bonded interaction energies of the amino acids interacting with the receptor corroborated their selection at respective positions. KEY FINDINGS The conformational changes exerted by the altered amino acids could be the reason for a broader range of interacting receptors among the selected proteins.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is usually used as a routine procedure in the treatment of retained pleural collections. The objective of this study was to find out if there is any advantage in adding the procedure for repairing lacerated lungs during VATS. METHODS Patients who were brought to our hospital with blunt chest trauma were enrolled into this prospective cohort study from January 2004 to December 2011. All enrolled patients had rib fractures with type III lung lacerations diagnosed by CT scans. They sustained retained pleural collections and surgical drainage was indicated. On one group, only evacuation procedure by VATS was performed. On the other group, not only evacuations but also repair of lung injuries were performed. Patients with penetrating injury or blunt injury with massive bleeding, that required emergency thoracotomy, were excluded from the study, in addition to those with cardiovascular or oesophageal injuries. RESULTS During the study period, 88 patients who underwent thoracoscopy were enrolled. Among them, 43 patients undergoing the simple thoracoscopic evacuation method were stratified into Group 1. The remaining 45 patients who underwent thoracoscopic evacuation combined with resection of lung lacerations were stratified into Group 2. The rates of post-traumatic infection were higher in Group 1. The durations of chest-tube drainage and ventilator usage were shorter in Group 2, as were the lengths of patient intensive care unit stay and hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS When compared with simple thoracoscopic evacuation methods, repair and resection of the injured lungs combined may result in better clinical outcomes in patients who sustained blunt chest injuries.","output":"The role of repairing lung lacerations during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery evacuations for retained haemothorax caused by blunt chest trauma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus infection that emerged in China in the last few months of 2019 has now spread globally. Italy registered its first case in the second half of February, and in a short time period, it became the top country in Europe in terms of the number of infected people and the first in the world in terms of deaths. The medical and scientific community has been called upon to manage the emergency and to take measures. Dentists also need to take new precautions during their clinical activity to protect themselves, coworkers and patients from the risks of contagion and to avoid further spread of infection. METHODS: Following the data published in the international literature as well as the guidelines and directives constantly updated by the WHO and by the national health authorities, a questionnaire to be completed anonymously was submitted online to Italian dentists using social tools and online professional platforms. The collected data were processed statistically, providing descriptive data and analysis of correlations of the most significant parameters using the Pearsons 2, the Likelihood-Ratio 2, Cramrs V, Fishers exact test, Goodman and Kruskals , and Kendalls b (p < 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 535 dentists from Italy participated in the survey. A good level of scientific knowledge about coronavirus and the extra precautionary measures needed to limit the spread was related to the age of respondents and their sex. Coming from areas with higher concentrations of cases affected knowledge, level of attention and perception of risk related to dental activity. CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, there are no therapies or vaccines to contain the infection with the new coronavirus that is causing many infections, many of which are fatal, worldwide. Dentists are one of the categories at highest risk of encountering diseases and infections because they work in close proximity with patients, and in their procedures, there is always contact with aerosols with high bacterial and viral potential. Therefore, during this COVID-19 emergency, it is important that dentists are properly informed and take the appropriate precautionary measures.","output":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Italy: knowledge, management of patients and clinical experience of Italian dentists during the spread of contagion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We exploit a recent computational framework to model and detect financial crises in stock markets, as well as shock events in cryptocurrency markets, which are characterized by a sudden or severe drop in prices.

The aim: to study the influence of countrys gross domestic product, population prevalence of overweight/ obesity, NCD mortality, and vaccination on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with two phases: correlation-regression interrelations in 1) all world countries; 2) all world non-island countries. The study includes the following data from 218 world countries: COVID-19 morbidity/mortality rates, GDP per capita, the prevalence of overweight/ obesity, NCD mortality among adults (both sexes), people fully vaccinated against COVID-19. RESULTS: An average percentage of the prevalence of overweight among adults in world countries by 2019 was 47.31  15.99%, obesity 18.34  9.64%, while the prevalence by 2016 were 39% and 13%, respectively. Overweight and obesity among adults during three years grew by 21.2% and 40.8%, respectively. Data from the world countries provide significant correlations (p < 0.0001) between COVID-19 morbidity, and: GDP (r = 0.517), overweight (r = 0.54), obesity (r = 0.528), NCD mortality (r = 0.537); COVID-19 mortality, and: GDP (r = 0.344), overweight (r = 0.514), obesity (r = 0.489), NCD mortality (r = 0.611); GDP, and: overweight (r = 0.507), obesity (r = 0.523), NCD mortality (r = 0.35), fully vaccinated people (r = 0.754). An increase in fully vaccinated people, from 3% to 30% of world population, decreases new confirmed COVID-19 cases, although the dependence was not significant (p = 0.07). Data from non-island world countries provides more highly significant correlations (p < 0.0001) between COVID-19 morbidity, and: GDP (r = 0.616), overweight (r = 0.581), obesity (r = 0.583); COVID-19 mortality, and: GDP (r = 0.43), overweight (r = 0.556), obesity (r = 0.539); GDP, and: overweight (r = 0.601), obesity (r = 0.633).

Extant research, however, has shown that perceptions of risk are not necessarily correlated with the level of actual risk, including that of COVID-19. Informed by the social amplification of risk framework (SARF), we test whether having a parasocial relationship with a celebrity who has COVID-19 makes the risk of contracting the virus more real, thus amplifying the perceived susceptibility to the virus and reducing the biased sense of optimism that one is safe. Findings from Study 1, a national survey (N = 493), suggest that having a parasocial friend contract COVID-19, is related to increased perceived susceptibility, especially for those for whom it would otherwise seem and vague. Study 2 (N = 228) complements these findings by identifying a potential underlying mechanism for the observed relationship between PSR and perceived susceptibility C attenuation of the optimism bias.

The current study aimed to identify key factors affecting the delivery of diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in Australian general practices. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study involving in-depth interviews was carried out from November 2019 to March 2020. Using purposive snowballing sampling, 15 general practitioners (GPs) were recruited from urban and rural general practices in New South Wales and Western Australia. A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect data from participants. All interviews were conducted over the phone by one facilitator, and each interview lasted up to 45 min. The Socio-Ecological Model was used to inform the content of the interview topic guides and subsequent data analysis. Recorded data were transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis was conducted to identify and classify recurrent themes. RESULTS: Of 15 GPs interviewed, 13 were male doctors, and the mean age was 54.7  15.5 years. Seven participants were practising in urban areas, while eight were practising in regional or remote areas. All participants had access to a direct ophthalmoscope, but none owned retinal cameras. None of the participants reported performing DR screening. Only three participants were aware of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items 12,325 and 12,326 that allow GPs to bill for retinal screening. Seven themes, a combination of facilitators and barriers, emerged from interviews with the GPs. Despite the strong belief in their role in managing chronic diseases, barriers such as costs of retinal cameras, time constraints, lack of skills to make DR diagnosis, and unawareness of Medicare incentives for non-mydriatic retinal photography made it difficult to conduct DR screening in general practice. However, several enabling strategies to deliver DR screening within primary care include increasing GPs access to continuing professional development, subsidising the cost of retinal cameras, and the need for a champion ace to take the responsibility of retinal photography. CONCLUSION: This study identified essential areas at the system level that require addressing to promote the broader implementation of DR screening, in particular, a nationwide awareness campaign to maximise the use of MBS items, improve GPs competency, and subsidise costs of the retinal cameras for small and rural general practices.

Blood was collected before (baseline) and up to 180 min after toothpaste ingestion as indicator of fluoride bioavailability. Total urine (24 h before and 24 h after ingestion) was collected as indicator of absorbed fluoride that was excreted. F concentration in blood plasma and urine was determined with a fluoride ion-specific electrode. The areas under the curve of F concentration vs. time (AUC=ng F/ml x min) and the peaks of fluoride concentration in blood plasma (Cmax) were calculated.

METHODS: We did a dual-frame (landline and mobile) cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 1501 Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or older (53.6% females) in April 2020. We collected data on the intention to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine when it becomes available (yes/ no/ undecided), knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, smoking, alcohol drinking, and sociodemographic factors. Prevalence estimates were weighted by the sex, age, and education of the general population of Hong Kong. RESULTS: Overall, 45.3% (95% CI: 42.3-48.4%) of the participants had intentions to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when it becomes available, 29.2% (26.5-32.1%) were undecided, and 25.5% (22.9-28.2%) had no intention. The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy (undecided or no intention) was safety concerns (56.5%).

METHODS: Statistical process control (SPC) charts, a quality improvement method, was used to identify special cause variation. A formal protocol was developed to provide guidance for nurses to remove IUCs when no longer indicated. Changes were also made within the electronic health record. RESULTS: Signals of improvement were not noted on the SPC charts for urinary catheter utilization or CAUTI rates. The frequency with which the NDP was documented (process measure) was assessed, showing it is used approximately 600 times each month. Of those catheters removed by the NDP, an average of 6% were reinserted within 48 hours (balancing measure). DISCUSSION: Our findings differed from other literature as we did not see a reduction in urinary catheter utilization after implementing a NDP. However, our project adds to the literature as we also evaluated process and balancing measures. CONCLUSION: A NDP for urinary catheter removal provides nurses with the autonomy to remove catheters when no longer indicated; however, other interventions should be added to a comprehensive CAUTI-prevention program.","output":"Using statistical process control charts to measure changes from a nurse-driven protocol to remove urinary catheters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 related critical illness is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Methods:ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel, including three patient representatives,and applied strategies to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews(up to March 5, 2021).The panel prioritized clinical questionsand outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approachto assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. This is an update on guidelines published in February 2021. Results:The panel agreed on one additional recommendation. The panel issued a conditional recommendation in favor of prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 related-critical illness who do not have confirmed or suspected VTE. Conclusions: This recommendation was based on low certainty in the evidence, underscoring the need for further high-quality, randomized controlled trials comparing different intensities of anticoagulation in critically ill patients. Other key research priorities include better evidence on predictors of thrombosis and bleeding risk in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and the impact of non-anticoagulant therapies (e.g., antiviral agents, corticosteroids) on thrombotic risk.","output":"American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: May 2021 update on the use of intermediate intensity anticoagulation in critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sigma 1 receptor (S1R) is a molecular chaperone protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes and has been shown to play important roles in various pathological disorders including pain and, as recently discovered, COVID-19.

METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort of consecutive adults evaluated in the emergency department and/or admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across 31 hospitals in four countries (1 February 2020-16 June 2020). The primary outcome was the incidence rate of cerebrovascular events, inclusive of acute ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhages (ICH), and cortical vein and/or sinus thrombosis (CVST). RESULTS: Of the 14,483 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 172 were diagnosed with an acute cerebrovascular event (1.13% of cohort; 1130/100,000 patients, 95%CI 970-1320/100,000), 68/171 (40.5%) were female and 96/172 (55.8%) were between the ages 60 and 79 years. Of these, 156 had acute ischemic stroke (1.08%; 1080/100,000 95%CI 920-1260/100,000), 28 ICH (0.19%; 190/100,000 95%CI 130-280/100,000), and 3 with CVST (0.02%; 20/100,000, 95%CI 4-60/100,000). The in-hospital mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2-associated stroke was 38.1% and for ICH 58.3%. After adjusting for clustering by site and age, baseline stroke severity, and all predictors of in-hospital mortality found in univariate regression (p < 0.1: male sex, tobacco use, arrival by emergency medical services, lower platelet and lymphocyte counts, and intracranial occlusion), cryptogenic stroke mechanism (aOR 5.01, 95%CI 1.63-15.44, p < 0.01), older age (aOR 1.78, 95%CI 1.07-2.94, p = 0.03), and lower lymphocyte count on admission (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34-0.98, p = 0.04) were the only independent predictors of mortality among patients with stroke and COVID-19.

In the Netherlands, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants circulated widely between September 2020 and August 2021. To understand how various control measures had impacted the spread of these VOCs, we analyzed 39,844 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected under the Dutch national surveillance program. We found that all four VOCs were introduced before targeted flight restrictions were imposed on countries where the VOCs first emerged. Importantly, foreign introductions, predominantly from other European countries, continued during these restrictions. Our findings show that flight restrictions had limited effectiveness in deterring VOC introductions due to the strength of regional land travel importation risks. We also found that the Alpha and Delta variants largely circulated more populous regions with international connections after their respective introduction before asymmetric bidirectional transmissions occurred with the rest of the country and the variant dominated infections in the Netherlands. As countries consider scaling down SARS-CoV-2 surveillance efforts in the post-crisis phase of the pandemic, our results highlight that robust surveillance in regions of early spread is important for providing timely information for variant detection and outbreak control.","output":"Regional importation and asymmetric within-country spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents early phase detection of Coronavirus (COVID-19), which is named by World Health Organization (WHO), by machine learning methods.

Negative binomial regression models estimated the associations between neighborhood risks and resources and sense of community factors for each dietary outcome of interest. While high perceived neighborhood violence (p < 0.001) and perceived community-level collective efficacy (p < 0.001) were associated with higher F+V consumption, no PCCs were directly associated with soda consumption overall.

We conducted a randomised triple-blinded validation trial, and a real-life study at the Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport, Finland. METHODS: Four dogs were trained to detect COVID-19 using skin swabs from individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Our controlled triple-blinded validation study comprised four identical sets of 420 parallel samples (from 114 individuals tested positive and 306 negative by RT-PCR), randomly presented to each dog over seven trial sessions. In a real-life setting the dogs screened skin swabs from 303 incoming passengers all concomitantly examined by nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Our main outcomes were variables of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) for scent dog identification in comparison with RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our validation experiments had an overall accuracy of 92% (95% CI 90% to 93%), a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 89% to 94%) and a specificity of 91% (95% CI 89% to 93%) compared with RT-PCR. For our dogs, trained using the wild-type virus, performance was less accurate for the alpha variant (89% for confirmed wild-type vs 36% for alpha variant, OR 14.0, 95% CI 4.5 to 43.4). In the real-life setting, scent detection and RT-PCR matched 98.7% of the negative swabs. Scant airport prevalence (0.47%) did not allow sensitivity testing; our only SARS-CoV-2 positive swab was not identified (alpha variant). However, ad hoc analysis including predefined positive spike samples showed a total accuracy of 98% (95% CI 97% to 99%). CONCLUSIONS: This large randomised controlled triple-blinded validation study with a precalculated sample size conducted at an international airport showed that trained scent dogs screen airport passenger samples with high accuracy.

Deafness in the corresponding mouse model, Slc26a4(?/?), results from an abnormally enlarged cochlear lumen. The goal of this study was to determine whether the cochlear enlargement originates with defective cochlear fluid transport or with a malfunction of fluid transport in the connected compartments, which are the vestibular labyrinth and the endolymphatic sac. Embryonic inner ears from Slc26a4(+/?) and Slc26a4(?/?) mice were examined by confocal microscopy ex vivo or after 2 days of organ culture. Culture allowed observations of intact, ligated or partially resected inner ears. Cochlear lumen formation was found to begin at the base of the cochlea between embryonic day (E) 13.5 and 14.5. Enlargement was immediately evident in Slc26a4(?/?) compared to Slc26a4(+/?) mice. In Slc26a4(+/?) and Slc26a4(?/?) mice, separation of the cochlea from the vestibular labyrinth by ligation at E14.5 resulted in a reduced cochlear lumen. Resection of the endolymphatic sacs at E14.5 led to an enlarged cochlear lumen in Slc26a4(+/?) mice but caused no further enlargement of the already enlarged cochlear lumen in Slc26a4(?/?) mice. Ligation or resection performed later, at E17.5, did not alter the cochlea lumen. In conclusion, the data suggest that cochlear lumen formation is initiated by fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth and temporarily controlled by fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac. Failure of fluid absorption in the endolymphatic sac due to lack of Slc26a4 expression appears to initiate cochlear enlargement in mice, and possibly humans, lacking functional Slc26a4 expression.","output":"Failure of Fluid Absorption in the Endolymphatic Sac Initiates Cochlear Enlargement that Leads to Deafness in Mice Lacking Pendrin Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Introdu??o No cenrio atual da COVID-19 e das consequentes medidas emergenciais para seu enfrentamento,  fundamental compreender sobre os impactos gerados por esta condi??o em grupos sociais que vivenciam condi??es especficas, como  o caso das crian?as e adolescentes com Transtorno do Espectro Autista (TEA).

OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness and safety of guselkumab at 24 weeks in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in routine clinical practice. METHODS Retrospective, multicentre study of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with guselkumab for at least 24 weeks in Spain. RESULTS We studied 343 patients, 249 of whom were followed for 24 weeks. By week 24, the mean (SD) Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) had decreased from 11.1 (7.3) to 1.7 (2.8) (-9.3; [-10.2;-8.4]), 85.9% of the patients had achieved PASI score of 4 or less and 77.9% a PASI score of 2 or less. In terms of relative PASI response, 59.4% of the patients achieved a PASI-90 response and 49.0% a PASI-100 response. On multivariate analysis, 2 factors reduced the probability of a PASI of 2 or less at 24 weeks: a BMI 30 (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.88) and a greater previous exposure to biologic therapy (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.84]). Adverse events were rare (9.9%) and led to withdrawal from treatment in only 9 patients (2.6%) by the end of the follow-up period.

In addition, while in the hospital, septic patients often experience prolonged periods of physical inactivity due to bed rest, which may exacerbate the myopathy. Physical rehabilitation emerges as a potential tool to prevent the decline in physical function in septic patients. Currently, there is no consensus regarding effective rehabilitation strategies for sepsis-induced myopathy. The optimal timing to initiate the rehabilitation intervention currently lacks consensus as well.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to characterize the clinical characteristics and outcomes following COVID-19 infection in this population in a single center in Brazil. METHODS: Out of 497 dialysis patients evaluated between March 1(st), 2020 and February 1(st), 2021, those presenting symptoms or history of close contact with COVID-19 patients were tested. Disease severity was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. RESULTS: Out of the 497 patients, 8.8% tested positive for COVID-19. These patients were predominantly male (59%), mean age 57.517. Hospitalization was required for 45.4% of patients and 15.9% received mechanical ventilation. Symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea and asthenia were more frequent in the severe group. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C- reactive protein, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase were significantly higher in the severe group, while hemoglobin and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower. Chest CT>50% of ground glass lesions was the risk factor associated with severe disease and need for hospitalization. The incidence of a thromboembolic event was of 22.7% in this population. The incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates were 954.4/10,000 patients, 151.8/10,000 patients, and 15.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence, mortality and case fatality rates in our cohort were significantly higher than those reported for the general population.

Over time, multiple disparities have been observed between the health of Black and White populations, associated mainly with socioeconomic inequalities. However, some mechanisms and pathophysiological susceptibilities begin to be elucidated that are related directly to the higher prevalence of multiple diseases in the Black population, including infection and death by COVID-19. Plasma vitamin D levels and evolutionary adaptations of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in Black people differ considerably from those of other races. The role of these factors in the development and progression of hypertension and multiple lung diseases, among them SARS-CoV-2 infection, is well established.

We undertook a systematic review by searching three electronic databases to identify what is known about the effectiveness of school closures and other school social distancing practices during coronavirus outbreaks.

Methods Minimally invasive autopsy was performed on forty-seven confirmed COVID-19 patients from May-July, 2020. Electronic medical record of all patients was collected and a comprehensive histopathological evaluation was performed. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, special stain, western blotting and post-mortem real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on fresh lung tissue were performed. Resultss We show that 5/47 (10,6%) patients present a progressive decline in oxygenation index for acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), low compliance levels, interstitial fibrosis, high -SMA+ cells/protein expression, high collagens I/III deposition and NETs(P<0.05), named as fibrotic phenotype (N=5).

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS and EMBASE and four trial registries were searched through 2 November 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included trials and observational studies that compared urine self-testing for pregnancy to health worker-led pregnancy testing on effectiveness outcomes; quantitative and qualitative studies describing values and preferences of end users and health workers and costs of pregnancy self-testing. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers used standardised methods to search, screen and code included studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration and Evidence Project tools. Meta-analysis was conducted using random effects models. Findings were summarised in GRADE evidence profiles and synthesised qualitatively. RESULTS: For effectiveness, four randomised trials following 5493 individuals after medical abortion showed no difference or improvements in loss to follow-up with home pregnancy self-testing compared with return clinic visits. One additional trial of community health workers offering home pregnancy tests showed a significant increase in pregnancy knowledge and antenatal counselling among 506 clients. Eighteen diverse values and preferences studies found support for pregnancy self-testing because of quick results, convenience, confidentiality/privacy, cost and accuracy. Most individuals receiving pregnancy self-tests for postabortion home management preferred this option. No studies reported cost data. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy self-testing is acceptable and valued by end users. Effectiveness data come mostly from articles on postabortion care, and cost data are lacking.

We constructed ensemble forecasting models of the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission, using data from 2010 through 2019. We then compared the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission in 2020 to the forecasts. RESULTS: 29,787,815 encounters were included, of which 1,913,085 (6.4%) occurred during 2020. ED encounters during 2020 were lower compared to prior years, with a 65.1% decrease in April relative to 2010C2019.

Because she had erythema and petechiae with a decreased platelet count, the dengue NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM/IgG test were performed, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RT-PCR assay detected the dengue virus serotype 1 infection. Additionally, increased liver enzyme serum levels were found in the patient, who later developed hepatomegaly. Hence, the mechanism of hepatic pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 and dengue coinfection needs further research.","output":"Case Report: Extrapulmonary Manifestations of COVID-19 and Dengue Coinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Since its outbreak, the COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic is rapidly spreading across India; although computed tomography of chest (CT chest) is not recommended as a screening tool, there is a rapid surge in the CT chest performed in suspected cases. We should be aware of the imaging features among the Indian population. AIM: To analyze the CT chest features in Indian COVID-19 patients. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Retrospective study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: CT chest of 31 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) verified patients of COVID-19 was assessed for ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations, bronchiectasis, pleural effusions, vascular enlargement, crazy paving, and reverse halo sign. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The data was analyzed in Microsoft Excel 2019. RESULTS: Only one patient showed a normal scan. Multilobar involvements with parenchymal abnormalities were seen in all the patients with bilateral involvement in 74.1%. 42.5% of the lung parenchymal abnormalities were pure GGOs, while 41.6% had GGOs mixed with consolidation. Peripheral and posterior lung field involvement was seen in 70.5% and 65.5%, respectively; 56.8% had well-defined margins. Pure GGOs were seen in all six patients, who underwent CT in the first 2 days of onset of symptoms. Seventeen patients scanned between 3 and 6 days of the illness showed GGOs mixed with consolidation and pure consolidations 76%. Vascular enlargement, crazy paving, and reverse halo sign were seen in 70%, 53%, and 35% of the patients, respectively. Patients scanned after 1 week of symptoms showed traction bronchiectasis along with GGOs and or consolidations. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pneumonia showed multifocal predominantly subpleural basal posteriorly located GGOs and/or consolidations which were predominantly well defined. Crazy paving was prevailing in the intermediate stage while early traction bronchiectasis among the patients presented later in the course of illness.","output":"CT chest analysis of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia: An Indian perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The case study of Belize highlights a success story in the region The country currently has no coronavirus cases, and only two citizens have died since the beginning of the pandemic This essay presents a snapshot of how the country has been able to achieve such positive results","output":"Coronavirus in Belize: A Central American Success"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to its fast international spread and substantial mortality, the coronavirus disease COVID-19 evolved to a global threat.

Priming of the S protein occurs via hydrolysis by different host proteases. The inhibition of these proteases could impair the processing of the S protein, thereby affecting the interaction with the host-cell receptors and preventing virus cell entry.

Health consequences are likely to result from these job losses, but without historical precedent for the current economic shutdown they are challenging to plan for. Our study aimed to use population risk models to quantify potential downstream health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and inform public health planning to minimize future health burden. METHODS: The impact of COVID-19 job losses on future premature mortality and high-resource health care utilization (HRU) was estimated using an economic model of Canadian COVID-19 lockdowns and validated population risk models. Five-year excess premature mortality and HRU were estimated by age and sex to describe employment-related health consequences of COVID-19 lockdowns in the Canadian population. RESULTS: With federal income supplementation like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, we estimate that each month of economic lockdown will result in 5.6 new high-resource health care system users (HRUs), and 4.1 excess premature deaths, per 100,000, over the next 5 years. These effects were concentrated in ages 45C64, and among males 18C34. Without income supplementation, the health consequences were approximately twice as great in terms of both HRUs and premature deaths. CONCLUSION: Employment losses associated with COVID-19 countermeasures may have downstream implications for health.

Beside incorrect lifestyles, such as smoking or excessive consumption of red meat and alcohol, inflammatory bowel diseases are considered driving factors for colorectal cancer onset and development. It is known that chronic inflammatory processes can lead to both intestinal barrier disruption and perturbation of microbial flora, thus increasing cancer risk. To date, no treatment against these inflammatory pathologies has proved efficient and resolutive. The glycoprotein lactoferrin, a safe supplement for infant and adult foods, is involved in immune defense and endowed with a number of properties, including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. This review outlines the most recent studies on lactoferrin as a potential candidate in the prevention and treatment of intestinal inflammatory pathologies that are associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. ABSTRACT: The connection between inflammation and cancer is well-established and supported by genetic, pharmacological and epidemiological data. The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis, have been described as important promoters for colorectal cancer development. Risk factors include environmental and food-borne mutagens, dysbalance of intestinal microbiome composition and chronic intestinal inflammation, with loss of intestinal epithelial barrier and enhanced cell proliferation rate. Therapies aimed at shutting down mucosal inflammatory response represent the foundation for IBDs treatment. However, when applied for long periods, they can alter the immune system and promote microbiome dysbiosis and carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is imperative to find new safe substances acting as both potent anti-inflammatory and anti-pathogen agents. Lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding glycoprotein essential in innate immunity, is generally recognized as safe and used as food supplement due to its multifunctionality. Lf possesses a wide range of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties against different aseptic and septic inflammatory pathologies, including IBDs. Moreover, Lf exerts anti-adhesive, anti-invasive and anti-survival activities against several microbial pathogens that colonize intestinal mucosa of IBDs patients. This review focuses on those activities of Lf potentially useful for the prevention/treatment of intestinal inflammatory pathologies associated with colorectal cancer development.","output":"Lactoferrin in the Prevention and Treatment of Intestinal Inflammatory Pathologies Associated with Colorectal Cancer Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The volume-viscosity swallow test (V-VST) is a clinical tool for screening and diagnosis of oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD).

This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. RESULTS: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3C16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha- CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats.","output":"Coronavirus and paramyxovirus in bats from Northwest Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Financial crises, such as the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 and the COVID-19 Crisis of 2020-2021, lead to high volatility in financial markets and highlight the importance of the debate on the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, a corollary of which is that in an efficient market it should not be possible to systematically make excess returns.

However, a lot has been theorized and associated with COVID-19, like the worst prognosis of the disease among individuals with some comorbidities, like diabetes mellitus. In this perspective, diabetic patients are repeatedly associated with more severe cases of COVID-19 when compared to non-diabetic patients.

Consequently, despite a low number of samples, we determined a lower frequency of COVID-19 among the patients who had a prior eCoV infection, and the results of this study support the previous findings that people with a prior eCoV infection develop a milder case of COVID-19. Our results may provide some insights for future studies aiming at vaccine development, but detailed investigations are still required.","output":"An evaluation of patients with a previous endemic coronavirus infection during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the conditions of the pandemic caused by the Covid-19 virus, the work of schools became directly conditioned by the possibility of students and teachers to attend classes, both due to their poor health condition and due to the possibility of transmitting the infection The main focus of this work is the determination of the ability of children to transmit the infection, as well as to point out the omissions in testing school-age children, having in mind the need to create a more realistic picture of the number of children infected with the Coronavirus The absence of symptoms or relatively mild symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus in infected children under the age of 18 have led most health workers to conclude that the virus is much less prevalent in this population, and that children are not the primary carriers of the infection However, although it may be true, it is premature to make such a conclusion, because it has not been supported by appropriate tests Most of the research done so far has been based on a study of children in whom the Covid-19 virus has already been confirmed or suspected However, the complete enigma remains the population of children in schools who has not shown the classic symptoms that are recognizable for this virus, or do not show any symptoms Respiratory infection is just one of the symptoms that can be most easily noticed, which is characterized by the Covid-19 virus However, this virus can attack practically any organ in the body, and it does not have to show any visible manifestation at the moment that would indicate the existence of this virus in a child Having all this in mind, as well as the fact that the number of asymptomatic cases in schools is unknown, the conclusion of this paper is that targeted testing of children in schools should be performed, regardless of the presence of symptoms or their absence This can be done in the quickest and easiest way by the method of a random selection of a school in a city and by testing all children in the observed school for the presence of the Covid-19 virus If it turns out that the percentage of infected students is higher than expected, the same testing procedure should be repeated in other schools in a particular city Initially, all larger urban areas should conduct such initial testing, and the test results will indicate whether there is a need to continue with this type of testing in smaller urban areas also, ie to expand the scope of testing on the basis of application of this methodology This approach, basically based on the principle of random sampling, can in a relatively fast and efficient way provide a more realistic picture of the presence of the Covid-19 virus in schools and the potential for students to further spread the virus to households and other environments","output":"Work in Schools in the Pandemic - a Proposal of a Method for Children Testing on Covid-19 Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the 24(th) November 2021 the sequence of a new SARS CoV-2 viral isolate spreading rapidly in Southern Africa was announced, containing far more mutations in Spike (S) than previously reported variants.

Survey questions included the demographics, uses, experiences, perceived benefits, and barriers of distance learning in dentistry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses were collected from the clinical dental school students. Categorical data were presented as frequencies (n) and percentages (%) and were analyzed using Fishers exact test. Results: Three hundred thirty-seven clinical dental students across four Egyptian dental schools responded. Most students used either Google Classroom or Microsoft Teams to access the online content. The data showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the academic performance of most participants (97.4%) with varying degrees. On average, students were neutral when asked to rate the online lectures, but did not find online practical education as effective (81.3%) as online theoretical teaching. The commonly described barriers to online teaching included loss of interaction with educators, inappropriateness in gaining clinical skills, and the instability of the internet connection.

At the onset of the pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period. Methods: We conducted a non-interventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19 targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Results: A total of 352 patients from 15 US hospitals were included. Most patients were treated at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and interleukin-6 inhibitors (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy. Patients with a history of asthma (14.9% vs. 7%, p=0.037) and those enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs. 3.2%, p<0.001) were more likely to receive therapy.

While much is known about HIV self-testing (HIVST), less is known about syphilis self-testing, particularly in low-income settings. The objective of this study is to determine context-specific facilitators and barriers for self-testing and to assess the usability of syphilis self-testing in Zimbabwe among men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: This mixed methods study was conducted in Harare as part of a larger syphilis self-testing trial. The study included in-depth interviews (phase I) followed by usability testing and a second interview (phase II). In-depth interviews were conducted with MSM and key informants prior to syphilis self-testing. The same MSM then used the syphilis self-test, quantitatively assessed its usability and participated in a second in-depth interview. Phase I data were analysed using a thematic approach, guided by an adapted social ecological model conceptual framework. Phase II interviews were analysed using rapid assessment procedure methodology, and usability was assessed using a pre-established index, adapted from existing HIVST scales. RESULTS: Twenty MSM and 10 key informants were recruited for phase I in-depth interviews, and 16 of these MSM participated in phase II by completing a syphilis self-test kit. Facilitating factors for self-testing included the potential for increased privacy, convenience, autonomy, and avoidance of social and healthcare provider stigma. Barriers included the fear to test and uncertainty about linkage to care and treatment. Data from the Usability Index suggested high usability (89.6% on a 0C100 scale) among the men who received the self-test. CONCLUSIONS: MSM in Zimbabwe were willing to use syphilis self-test kits and many of the barriers and facilitators were similar to those observed for HIVST.

The study aims to identify changes in behaviors and immediate expectations after the quarantine was lifted. In general, results show that people have adopted behavioral changes such as wearing face masks, avoiding people with symptoms, and reducing mobility. However, it also shows that people's concerns have doubled for many reasons, ranging from mental health issues, neglected sexual and reproductive health needs, the burden of care for others, and working from home. Similarly, it was found that some people would accept significant long-term changes such as accepting most children continuing to be homeschooled or employees choosing whether to work or not, targeted quarantines in neighborhoods that show high number of cases; and making the use of face masks mandatory in case a vaccine or treatment for Covid-19 does not become available. This means that during the quarantine and compared to April, many people consider these options to be acceptable in the long term. The survey was filled out online via SurveyMonkey by 1,735 people in Colombia between 1st and 11th September, 2020.

We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels: the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 2-9% and 3-11% decrease in cumulative infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 6 days.

Materials and methods. The study involved 90 children. The main group consisted of 75 inpatient children with a diagnosis of COVID-19-associated pneumonia (positive PCR - polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription). Patients in the main group were divided into 2 subgroups: subgroup I consisted of 49 patients with a pneumonia of moderate course, and subgroup II - 26 patients with a pneumonia of severe course. The control group consisted of 15 prac- tically healthy children. The scheme of examination of sick children included anamnestic data, the use of clinical, instrumental and laboratory, immunological exam-ination methods. The concentration of vitamin D in the blood serum of sick and healthy children was determined by the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The indicators were measured on a Stat Fax 4700 device using a Pishqaman reactive kit (made in Germany). Results. The concentration of vitamin D in blood serum was 1.8 times lower in subgroup I and 2.0 times in subgroup II, compared with the control group. The aver-age values of vitamin D in blood serum compared with the control group were <1.1 times lower in the age group <1 year, 1.1 times lower in the age group 1-3 years, and 2.3 times lower in the age group >3 years. Conclusions. Based on our research, it can be concluded that there is a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19. Thus, the average level of vita3 min D was lower in children with COVID-19-associated pneumonia, and varied depending on the severity of the disease (more pronounced changes were observed in severe pneumonia). There are also differences in vitamin D levels in the age groups of children with COVID-19-associated pneumonia: in children from age groups under 1 year and 1-3 years old the decrease in serum vitamin D level is less pronounced than in the age group over 3 years old. The main mechanisms of vitamin D involvement in the immune modulation process in COVID-19 require further study.

These vaccines have been associated with inflammatory sides effects such as myo- and peri-carditis. Despite the well-known link between inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, it is unknown whether these vaccines may transiently impair endothelial function, and therefore increase cardiovascular risk. AIM To evaluate the influence of COVID-19-based mRNA vaccines on macro- and micro-vascular endothelial function in healthy adults. We hypothesized that macro- and micro-vascular endothelial function would be reduced following vaccination. METHODS Prior to, and ~48 hrs following the second dose of COVID-19-based mRNA vaccines, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD, macrovascular function), reactive hyperemia (microvascular function), and cutaneous intradermal microdialysis coupled with laser Doppler flowmetry (microvascular function) were measured in healthy young adults. For microdialysis, a standard local heating protocol (42?C) was utilized, followed by infusion of the Nitric Oxide Synthase inhibitor N -Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME, 15mM), and induction of maximum vasodilation (43?C+28mM Sodium Nitroprusside). Sites included: control (lactated Ringer's), ascorbic acid (10 mM), l-arginine (10 mM), and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4,10 mM). C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, was measured from fasting serum samples at both time points. RESULTS Vaccination (mRNA-1273, n=3 and BNT162b2, n=6, 5men/4women, 342yrs) induced an increase in CRP (pre: 0.20.1mg/dL vs. post: 2.10.5mg/dL, p=0.008, r-statistic=-0.89), but had no effect on FMD (pre: 3.60.9% vs. post: 4.61.1%, p=0.43, Cohen's d=0.28) or reactive hyperemia (pre: 201783236 AU vs. post: 284264573 AU, p=0.14, Cohen's d=0.55). There was no association between the change in FMD (r=-0.07, p=0.87) or reactive hyperemia (r=-0.48, p=0.19) and the change in CRP. Vaccination also had no effect on microvascular nitric oxide (NO)-dependent dilation (pre: 77.02.5% vs post: 77.32.4%, p=0.91, p 2 =0.002), nor was there an effect of microdialysis treatment on NO-dependent dilation (p=0.74, p 2 =0.05).

In addition, the contribution of nature on subjective well-being was measured through Likert scale statements and the perceived changes in outdoor recreation behaviour were measured through self-reported number of days and from responses to open survey questions. Data was analysed through quantitative, qualitative and spatial methods. The results show that nearly half of the respondents increased outdoor recreation and the majority of outdoor recreation sites were visited more or as often as before the pandemic. The spatial analysis revealed that the most often visited recreation sites were near forests, semi-natural areas and housing areas as well as relatively close to respondents residence. Respondents had various reasons for changes in outdoor recreation behaviour. For some a shift to working remotely and changes in everyday routines led to spending time outdoors more often and for some spending less while others avoided recreation in crowded areas due to social distancing. The results also indicate that peoples opportunities to adapt to the pandemic conditions differ greatly. The natures contribution to subjective well-being during COVID-19 was important regardless of respondents outdoor recreation behaviour. Our study highlights that urban planning should respond to different needs for outdoor recreation in order to widely, and in a just way, promote the well-being benefits of urban nature during a pandemic, and to increase the resilience of the city and its residents. Participatory mapping can capture the variety in residents values and identify key recreation sites of multiple ecosystem service benefits.","output":"Outdoor recreation and natures contribution to well-being in a pandemic situation - Case Turku, Finland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Lung volume reduction coil (LVRC) treatment is established in daily endoscopic lung volume reduction routine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LVRC treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of 86 patients (male/female: 40/46, mean age: 647 years) with severe COPD and bilateral incomplete fissures. A total of 10 coils were unilaterally implanted in a single lobe, and 28 out of 86 patients were treated bilaterally. At 90-, 180-, and 365-day follow-up, changes in pulmonary function test (PFT), 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, as well as possible complications, were recorded. RESULTS At 90 days, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second did improve (P<0.001), but the improvement was not sustained at the 180- and 365-day follow-up (baseline: 0.710.21 vs 0.770.23 vs 0.730.22 vs 0.700.18 L). Both vital capacity and residual volume improved significantly (P<0.001) at the 90- and 180-day follow-up, but the improvement was lost after 365 days. Total lung capacity decreased at the 90-day follow-up but returned to baseline values at the 180- and 365-day follow-up. 6MWT (P=0.01) and mMRC (P=0.007) also improved at 90 and 180 days (6MWT of 3154 and 2060 m, respectively), but the improvement was also lost at the 365-day follow-up. No significant further improvement was evident at any point in the follow-up after the second procedure. A total of 4 out of 86 patients passed away due to complications. Significant complications in the first 3 months and then at 12 months included the following: severe hemoptysis in 4 (3.5%) and 4 (3.5%) patients, pneumonia requiring hospitalization in 32 (28.1%) and 9 (7.9%) patients and pneumothorax in 7 (6.1%) and 2 (1.7%) patients, respectively. Milder adverse events included self-limited hemoptysis, pneumonias, or COPD exacerbations treated orally. CONCLUSION LVRC improved PFT, 6MWT and mMRC initially, but the improvement was lost after 365 days.

During 14 days of hospitalization, he had no symptoms and was not given supplemental oxygen. About 3 weeks after discharge, he was re-admitted to the same hospital with new-onset continuous fever and general weakness. At the time of his second admission, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR was performed on a retro-nasal swab and the result was negative. Four days after admission, the patient was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) following deterioration of his respiratory and haemodynamic conditions, where he received mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pumping, and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained again at ICU admission, but RT-PCR was negative for SARS-CoV-2. All antibody titres measured against other viruses were low. Blood cultures were negative, and no bacteria were observed in sputum samples. However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-PCR from sections obtained by myocardial biopsy. The patients final diagnosis was delayed-onset SARS-CoV-2-induced fulminant myocarditis (FM). We strongly suggested that one of the proposed mechanisms of COVID-19-related myocardial injury will be the direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes even if delayed-onset.

Its diagnosis might be challenging. We present two critically ill patients with COVID-19 who presented acutely altered mental status as the main manifestation of multiple strokes. METHODS: Clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up of the patients. RESULTS: Two patients in their sixties were hospitalized with a bilateral pneumonia COVID-19. They developed respiratory failure and were admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilation and intense medical treatment. They were started on low-molecular-weight heparin since admission. Their laboratory results showed lymphopenia and increased levels of C-reactive protein and D-dimer. Case 1 developed hypofibrinogenemia and presented several cutaneous lesions with biopsy features of thrombotic vasculopathy. Case 2 was performed a CT pulmonary angiogram at ICU showing a bilateral pulmonary embolism. When waking up, both patients were conscious but with a remarkable global altered mental status without focal neurological deficits. A brain MRI revealed multiple acute bilateral ischemic lesions with areas of hemorrhagic transformation in both patients (case 1: affecting the left frontal and temporal lobes and both occipital lobes; case 2: affecting both frontal and left occipital lobes). Cardioembolic source and acquired antiphospholipid syndrome were ruled out. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy was suspected as the possible main etiology of the strokes. CONCLUSION: Acutely altered mental status might be the main manifestation of multiple brain infarctions in critically ill COVID-19 patients. It should be specially considered in those with suspected COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Full-dose anticoagulation and clinical-radiological monitoring might reduce their neurological consequences.","output":"Acutely altered mental status as the main clinical presentation of multiple strokes in critically ill patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To estimate the association of emotional distress with both consumption of energy-dense micronutrient-poor foods (EDF) and body mass index (BMI) and the association between EDF consumption and change in BMI, during COVID-19 pandemic in patients with prior bariatric surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study applied an online structured questionnaire to 75 postoperative bariatric patients during the first Portuguese lockdown. Emotional distress was assessed trough the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and dietary intake was evaluated by Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Self-reported BMI prior to and at the end of confinement was used to compute BMI change. Pre-surgery BMI was computed from measured height and weight from clinical records. RESULTS: After adjustment for education, sex, time since surgery, pre-surgery BMI, and exercise practice, moderate/severe scores in HADS were significantly positively associated with consumption of EDF (? = 0.799; 95% CI: 0.051, 1.546), but not with BMI. Daily EDF consumption significantly increased the odds of maintaining/increasing BMI (OR = 3.34; 95% CI: 1.18, 9.45), instead of decreasing it (reference). Sweets consumption was the only subcategory of EDF significantly positively associated with the odds of a worse outcome in BMI change (OR = 4.01; 95% CI: 1.13, 14.22). CONCLUSIONS: Among postoperative bariatric patients, higher reported levels of emotional distress during confinement are associated with increased EDF consumption. Increased EDF consumption during confinement, particularly sweets, is associated with higher odds of bariatric patients not decreasing their BMI. Additional effort is needed to address inadequate lifestyle behaviors among these patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We investigated the effect of smoking on outcome following endovascular therapy (EVT) with mechanical thrombectomy alone versus in combination with intra-arterial (IA-) thrombolysis. METHODS The primary endpoint was defined by three-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We performed a generalized linear model and reported relative risks (RR) for smoking (adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke severity, time to EVT) in patient data stemming from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive-Endovascular database. RESULTS Among 1,497 patients, 740(49.4%) were randomized to EVT; among EVT patients, 524(35.0%) received mechanical thrombectomy alone and 216(14.4%) received it in combination with IA-thrombolysis. Smokers (N = 396) had lower mRS scores (mean 2.9 vs. 3.2; p = 0.02) and mortality rates (10% vs. 17.3%; p<0.001) in univariate analysis. In all patients and in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy alone, smoking had no effect on outcome in regression analyses. In patients who received IA-thrombolysis (N = 216;14%), smoking had an adjusted RR of 1.65 for an mRS1 (95%CI 0.77-3.55). Treatment with IA-thrombolysis itself led to reduced RR for favorable outcome (adjusted RR 0.30); interaction analysis of IA-thrombolysis and smoking revealed that non-smokers with IA-thrombolysis had mRS2 in 47 cases (30%, adjusted RR 0.53 [0.41-0.69]) while smokers with IA-thrombolysis had mRS2 in 23 cases (38%, adjusted RR 0.61 [0.42-0.87]).

It remains unknown whether cognitive sparing with proton radiotherapy (PRT) supports better social outcomes relative to photon radiotherapy (XRT). We hypothesized that survivors treated with PRT would outperform those treated with XRT on measures of cognitive and social outcomes. Further, we hypothesized that cognitive performance would predict survivor social outcomes. PROCEDURE Survivors who underwent PRT (n = 38) or XRT (n = 20) participated in a neurocognitive evaluation >1 year post radiotherapy. Group differences in cognitive and social functioning were assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Regression analyses examined predictors of peer relations and social skills. RESULTS Age at evaluation, radiation dose, tumor diameter, and sex did not differ between groups (all p > .05). XRT participants were younger at diagnosis (XRT M = 5.0 years, PRT M = 7.6 years) and further out from radiotherapy (XRT M = 8.7 years, PRT M = 4.6 years). The XRT group performed worse than the PRT group on measures of processing speed (p = .01) and verbal memory (p < .01); however, social outcomes did not differ by radiation type. The proportion of survivors with impairment in peer relations and social skills exceeded expectation; 2 (1) = 38.67, p < .001; 2 (1) = 5.63, p < .05. Household poverty predicted peer relation difficulties (t = 2.18, p < .05), and verbal memory approached significance (t = -1.99, p = .05). Tumor diameter predicted social skills (t = -2.07, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS Regardless of radiation modality, survivors are at risk for social challenges.

Aim: Exploring common and distinctive characteristics of Brazilian and Portuguese older adults aged 70 and over regarding positive self-rated health according to sociodemographic variables, to functional capacity, to independent performance of basic activities of daily living and to neuroticism, as well as analyzing associations between positive self-rated health and these variables. Methods: The present paper is a comparative and cross-sectional study based on secondary data contained in the databases of the FIBRA (Frailty in Brazilian Older Adults) follow-up study, with 418 Brazilian older adults, and of the DIA (From Disability to Activity: The Challenge of Aging) study, with 380 Portuguese older adults. Both samples had higher percentages of women: 68.4% for Portugal and 69.9% for Brazil. The Brazilian sample had a higher average age (80.31  4.67) than the Portuguese sample (76.80  5.28). Results: The Portuguese older adults had better overall cognition scores, higher handgrip strength and higher neuroticism values than the Brazilian older adults. In the simple and multiple logistic regression analyses, it was found that among Brazilian older adults, subjects with higher scores in the MMSE (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08C1.24), regardless of ADL performance (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.31C3.47) and with scores 24C29 (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.07C3.43) or 11C23 (OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.15C3.79) in neuroticism were more likely to assess their health as very good/good.

Because expression of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), and chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been demonstrated in breast cancer, targeting these receptors using radioligands might offer new imaging and therapeutic opportunities for breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to correlate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of GRPR, SSTR2, and CXCR4 with clinicopathologic and biologic factors, and with prognosis and prediction to therapy response, in order to identify specific breast cancer patient groups suited for the application of radioligands targeting these receptors. METHODS First, we studied GRPR and SSTR2 expression in 13 clinical breast cancer specimens by in vitro autoradiography and correlated this with corresponding mRNA levels to investigate whether mRNA levels reliably represent cell surface expression. Next, GRPR, SSTR2, and CXCR4 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 915 primary breast cancer tissues and correlated with known clinicopathologic and biologic factors, disease-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival (DFS, MFS, and OS, respectively). In 224 adjuvant hormonal treatment-na?ve estrogen receptor (ER, ESR1)-positive patients who received tamoxifen as first-line therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease, the expression levels of the receptors were correlated with progression-free survival. RESULTS Our results showed a significant positive correlation between GRPR and SSTR2 expression analyzed by in vitro autoradiography and by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [Rs]=0.94, P<0.001, and Rs=0.73, P=0.0042, respectively). Furthermore, high GRPR and SSTR2 mRNA levels were observed more frequently in ESR1-positive specimens, whereas high CXCR4 expression was associated with ESR1-negative specimens. Also, high mRNA expression of CXCR4 was associated with a prolonged DFS, MFS, and OS (multivariate hazard ratio MFS=0.76 [95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.90], P=0.001), whereas high mRNA levels of GRPR were associated with a prolonged progression-free survival after the start of first-line tamoxifen treatment (multivariate hazard ratio=0.68 [95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.97], P=0.031).

Background The new influenza virus A/H1N1 (2009), identified in mid\\\\2009, rapidly spread over the world. Estimating the transmissibility of this new virus was a public health priority. Methods We reviewed all studies presenting estimates of the serial interval or generation time and the reproduction number of the A/H1N1 (2009) virus infection. Results Thirteen studies documented the serial interval from household or close\\\\contact studies, with overall mean 3 days (95% CI: 24, 36); taking into account tertiary transmission reduced this estimate to 26 days. Model\\\\based estimates were more variable, from 19 to 6 days. Twenty\\\\four studies reported reproduction numbers for community\\\\based epidemics at the town or country level. The range was 12C31, with larger estimates reported at the beginning of the pandemic. Accounting for under\\\\reporting in the early period of the pandemic and limiting variation because of the choice of the generation time interval, the reproduction number was between 12 and 23 with median 15. Discussion The serial interval of A/H1N1 (2009) flu was typically short, with mean value similar to the seasonal flu. The estimates of the reproduction number were more variable. Compared with past influenza pandemics, the median reproduction number was similar (1968) or slightly smaller (1889, 1918, 1957).","output":"Transmission parameters of the A/H1N1 (2009) influenza virus pandemic: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The loss of smell related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19. It is now clear that this symptom is related to the massive infection by SARS-CoV-2 of the olfactory epithelium leading to its desquamation. However, the molecular mechanism behind the destabilization of the olfactory epithelium is less clear. Using golden Syrian hamster, we show here that while apoptosis remains at a low level in damaged infected epithelium, the latter is invaded by innate immunity cells. By depleting the neutrophil population or blocking the activity of neutrophil elastase-like proteinases, we reduced the damage induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surprisingly, the impairment of neutrophil activity led to a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 infection levels in the nasal cavity. Our results indicate a counterproductive role of neutrophils leading to the release of infected cells in the lumen of the nasal cavity and thereby enhanced spreading of the virus.","output":"Neutrophils initiate the destruction of the olfactory epithelium during SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Several online sources provide up-to-date open-access data on numbers, rates and proportions of COVID-19 deaths. Our article aims of comparing and interpreting between-country trends of mortality rate, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality. METHODS: We used data from open databases (Our World in Data mostly) for comparing mortality of eleven western countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA). Between-country trends in mortality rate and case-fatality (both including deaths for COVID-19 as numerator and therefore labelled as COVID-19 mortality metrics) and all-cause excess mortality (i.e. observed deaths during the epidemic compared with those expected based on mortality in the same periods of previous years) were compared. RESULTS: Although Belgium ranks first in mortality from COVID-19 (possibly due to the broadest criterion for attributing a death to COVID-19), it does not rank first for all-cause excess mortality. Conversely, compared with Belgium, the UK, Italy and Spain have reported lower COVID-19 mortality (possibly due to the narrower definitions for a COVID-19 death) but higher all-cause excess mortality. Germany and Austria are the unique countries for which COVID-19 mortality, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality consistently exhibited the lowest rates. CONCLUSION: Between-country heterogeneity of COVID-19 mortality metrics could be largely explained by differences of criteria for attributing a death to COVID-19; in age/comorbidity structures; in policies for identifying asymptomatic people affected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. All-cause excess mortality is recommended as a more reliable metric for comparing countries.","output":"Lessons from COVID-19 mortality data across countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction has been increasing. The current ADMs available for breast reconstruction are offered as aseptic or sterile. No published studies have compared aseptic and sterile ADM in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction. The authors performed a retrospective study to evaluate the outcomes of aseptic versus sterile ADM in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction. METHODS Implant-based immediate breast reconstructions with ADM conducted between April 2013 and January 2016 were included. The patients were divided into 2 groups: the aseptic ADM (AlloDerm) group and the sterile ADM (MegaDerm) group. Archived records were reviewed for demographic data and postoperative complication types and frequencies. The complications included were infection, flap necrosis, capsular contracture, seroma, hematoma, and explantation for any cause. RESULTS Twenty patients were reconstructed with aseptic ADM, and 68 patients with sterile ADM. Rates of infection (15.0% vs. 10.3%), flap necrosis (5.0% vs. 7.4%), capsular contracture (20.0% vs. 14.7%), seroma (10.0% vs. 14.7%), hematoma (0% vs. 1.5%), and explantation (10.0% vs. 8.8%) were not significantly different in the 2 groups.

Questions were related to personal psychosocial details and alcohol drinking habits during the lockdown, including Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT C) questions. RESULTS On a total of 1234 surveys the increase of both anxiety and fear was largely detected (63% and 61% respectively). The 18% increased alcohol consumption during the lockdown and it showed a significant correlation with anxiety and fear experienced (both p<0.001). The relative risk for 7 to 9 and more than 10 drinks per day consumption were directly linked to these symptoms (p<0.001). The most involved categories of participants showed this harmful association were self-employed workers and participants who live alone, subject aged 30-50 with high level of instruction or students and not occupied people in the age range 18-19 (all p<0.001).

This typically involves a preoperative symptom screen and nasal swab RT-PCR test for viral RNA. Asymptomatic patients with a negative COVID-19 test are cleared for surgery. However, little is known about the rate of postoperative COVID-19 positivity among elective surgical patients, risk factors for this group and rate of complications. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study included all patients undergoing elective surgery at 170 Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals across the United States. Patients were divided into groups based on first positive COVID-19 test within 30 days after surgery (COVID[-/+]), before surgery (COVID[+/?]) or negative throughout (COVID[?/?]). The cumulative incidence, risk factors for and complications of COVID[-/+], were estimated using univariate analysis, exact matching, and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Between March 1 and December 1, 2020 90,093 patients underwent elective surgery. Of these, 60,853 met inclusion criteria, of which 310 (0.5%) were in the COVID[-/+] group. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression identified female sex, end stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, cancer, cirrhosis, and undergoing neurosurgical procedures as risk factors for being in the COVID[-/+] group. After matching on current procedural terminology code and month of procedure, multivariable Poisson regression estimated the complication rate ratio for the COVID[-/+] group vs. COVID[?/?] to be 8.4 (C.I. 4.9C14.4) for pulmonary complications, 3.0 (2.2, 4.1) for major complications, and 2.6 (1.9, 3.4) for any complication. DISCUSSION: Despite preoperative COVID-19 screening, there remains a risk of COVID infection within 30 days after elective surgery. This risk is increased for patients with a high comorbidity burden and those undergoing neurosurgical procedures.

Here, we determined the effect of commercially available mouth rinses and antiseptic povidone-iodine on the infectivity of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We first determined the effect of mouth rinses on cell viability to ensure that antiviral activity was not a consequence of mouth rinse-induced cytotoxicity. Colgate Peroxyl (hydrogen peroxide) exhibited the most cytotoxicity, followed by povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and Listerine (essential oils and alcohol). The potent antiviral activities of Colgate Peroxyl mouth rinse and povidone-iodine were the consequence of rinse-mediated cellular damage when the products were present during infection. The potency of CHG was greater when the product was not washed off after virus attachment, suggesting that the prolonged effect of mouth rinses on cells impacts the antiviral outcome. To minimalize mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, mouth rinse was largely removed from treated viruses by centrifugation prior to infection of cells. A 5% (v/v) dilution of Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine completely blocked viral infectivity. A similar 5% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG had a moderate suppressive effect on the virus, but a 50% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG blocked viral infectivity completely. Mouth rinses inactivated the virus without prolonged incubation. The new infectivity assay, with limited impacts of mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, showed the differential effects of mouth rinses on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Understanding their capabilities and limitations is, therefore, essential for successful implementation. We evaluated six commercial LFDs and assessed their correlation with infectious virus culture and PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values. METHODS: In a single-centre, laboratory evaluation study, we did a head-to-head comparison of six LFDs commercially available in the UK: Innova Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test, Spring Healthcare SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette, E25Bio Rapid Diagnostic Test, Encode SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Device, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test Cassette, and SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Fluorescence Antigen Test. We estimated the specificities and sensitivities of the LFDs using stored naso-oropharyngeal swabs collected at St Thomas' Hospital (London, UK) for routine diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing by real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). Swabs were from inpatients and outpatients from all departments of St Thomas' Hospital, and from health-care staff (all departments) and their household contacts. SARS-CoV-2-negative swabs from the same population (confirmed by RT-rtPCR) were used for comparative specificity determinations. All samples were collected between March 23 and Oct 27, 2020. We determined the limit of detection (LOD) for each test using viral plaque-forming units (PFUs) and viral RNA copy numbers of laboratory-grown SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, LFDs were selected to assess the correlation of antigen test result with RT-rtPCR Ct values and positive viral culture in Vero E6 cells. This analysis included longitudinal swabs from five infected inpatients with varying disease severities. Furthermore, the sensitivities of available LFDs were assessed in swabs (n=23; collected from Dec 4, 2020, to Jan 12, 2021) confirmed to be positive (RT-rtPCR and whole-genome sequencing) for the B.1.1.7 variant, which was the dominant genotype in the UK at the time of study completion. FINDINGS: All LFDs showed high specificity (980%), except for the E25Bio test (860% [95% CI 779C999]), and most tests reliably detected 50 PFU/test (equivalent SARS-CoV-2 N gene Ct value of 237, or RNA copy number of 3  10(6)/mL). Sensitivities of the LFDs on clinical samples ranged from 650% (552C736) to 890% (814C938). These sensitivities increased to greater than 90% for samples with Ct values of lower than 25 for all tests except the SureScreen fluorescence (SureScreen-F) test. Positive virus culture was identified in 57 (404%) of 141 samples; 54 (947%) of the positive cultures were from swabs with Ct values lower than 25. Among the three LFDs selected for detailed comparisons (the tests with highest sensitivity [Innova], highest specificity [Encode], and alternative technology [SureScreen-F]), sensitivity of the LFDs increased to at least 947% when only including samples with detected viral growth. Longitudinal studies of RT-rtPCR-positive samples (tested with Innova, Encode, and both SureScreen-F and the SureScreen visual [SureScreen-V] test) showed that most of the tests identified all infectious samples as positive. Test performance (assessed for Innova and SureScreen-V) was not affected when reassessed on swabs positive for the UK variant B.1.1.7. INTERPRETATION: In this comprehensive comparison of antigen LFDs and virus infectivity, we found a clear relationship between Ct values, quantitative culture of infectious virus, and antigen LFD positivity in clinical samples. Our data support regular testing of target groups with LFDs to supplement the current PCR testing capacity, which would help to rapidly identify infected individuals in situations in which they would otherwise go undetected.

The aim was to the achieve rapid rollout of an off-site OFC service, delivering high throughput of long waiting patients, while aligning with hospital existing policies and quality standards, international allergy guidelines and national social distancing standards. Methods: The working group engaged key stakeholders to rapidly develop an offsite OFC facility. Consultant Paediatric Allergists, Consultant Paediatricians, trainees and Allergy Clinical Nurse Specialists were seconded from other duties. The facility was already equipped with hospital beds, bedside monitors(BP, Pulse, Oxygen saturation) bedside oxygen. All medication and supplies had to be brought from the base hospital. Daily onsite consultant anaesthetic cover was resourced and a resuscitation room equipped. Standardised food challenge protocols were created. Access to onsite hotel chef facilitated food preparation. A risk register was established. Results: After 6wks planning, the remote centre became operational on 7/9/20, with the capacity of 27 OFC/day. 474 challenges were commenced, 465 (98%) were completed, 9(2%) were inconclusive. 135(29.03%) OFC were positive, 25(5%) causing anaphylaxis. No child required advanced airway intervention. 8 children were transferred to the base hospital. The CHI allergy waiting list was reduced by almost 60% in only 24 days. Conclusions: OFCs remain a vital tool in the care of allergic children, with their cost saving and quality of life benefits negatively affected by delay in their delivery. This project has shown it is possible to have huge impacts on a waiting list efficiently, effectively and safely with good planning and staff buy in C even in a pandemic. Adoption of new, flexible and efficient models of service delivery will be important for healthcare delivery in the post-COVID-19 era.","output":"Mass food challenges in a vacant COVID-19 stepdown facility: exceptional opportunity provides a model for the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a detectable serological immune response even though extent of its protection is still not yet well known.

We reanalyzed the metabolic-related gene profiles in single-cell RNA sequencing data, drew the metabolic landscape in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid immune cells, and elucidated the metabolic remodeling mechanism that might lead to the progression of COVID-19 and the cytokine storm. Enhanced glycolysis is the most important common metabolic feature of all immune cells in COVID-19 patients. CCL2(+) T cells, Group 2 macrophages with high SPP1 expression and myeloid dendritic cells are among the main contributors to the cytokine storm produced by infected lung tissue. Two metabolic analysis methods, including Compass, showed that glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, bile acid synthesis and purine and pyrimidine metabolism levels of CCL2(+) T cells, Group 2 macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells were upregulated and correlated with cytokine storms of COVID-19 patients.

We assessed effects of sanitary pad distribution and RH education on girls in primary grade 7 in Kilifi, Kenya. METHODS A cluster randomized controlled trial design was used. Eligible clusters were all non-boarding schools in three sub-counties in Kilifi County that had a minimum of 25 girls enrolled in primary grade 7. 140 primary schools, 35 per arm, were randomly assigned to one of four study arms: (1) control; (2) sanitary pad distribution; (3) RH education; or (4) both sanitary pad distribution and RH education. Outcomes were school attendance, school engagement, RH knowledge and attitudes, gender norms, and self-efficacy. For outcomes measured both at baseline and endline, difference-in-differences (DID) models were estimated and for outcomes without baseline data available, analysis of covariance models were used. RESULTS The study enrolled 3489 randomly selected girls in primary grade 7, with a mean age of 14.4 (SD 1.5). Girls in arms 2 and 4 received on average 17.6 out of 20 packets of sanitary pads and girls in arms 3 and 4 participated on average in 21 out of 25 RH sessions. Ninety-four percent of the baseline sample was interviewed at the end of the intervention with no differential attrition by arm. There was no evidence of an effect on primary school attendance on arm 2 (coefficient [coef] 0.37, 95% CI - 0.73, 1.46), arm 3 (coef 0.14, 95% CI - 0.99, 1.26) or arm 4 (coef 0.58, 95% CI - .37, 1.52). There was increased positive RH attitudes for girls in arm 3 (DID coef. 0.63, 95% CI 0.40-0.86) and arm 4 (DID coef. 0.85, 95% CI 0.64, - 1.07). There was also an increase in RH knowledge, gender norms and self-efficacy in arms 3 and 4. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that neither sanitary pad distribution nor RH education, on their own or together, were sufficient to improve primary school attendance. However, as the RH education intervention improved RH outcomes, the evidence suggests that sanitary pad distribution and RH education can be positioned in broader RH programming for girls.

Through analysing quantitative data on age, gender, learner type, and commenting rates in peer-to-peer discussions, we examine the development and delivery of an engineering MOOC, before, during, and after COVID-19-related lockdowns in the UK, to identify what aspects of online learning might be harnessed to improve diversity in engineering education. The results show that the MOOC attracted a better gender balance than reported for UK-based in-person engineering programmes. In addition, we show that careful structuring of discussion prompts encouraged higher levels of social learning. We recommend the continued use of interactive and discursive elements within a blended learning environment to positively impact diversity and inclusion in engineering education specifically, and STEM education in general.","output":"Establishing Social Learning in an Engineering MOOC: Benefits for Diversity and Inclusion in Engineering Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in recent months we have experienced deep changes in our daily and professional lives.

This qualitative study employs a social-ecological framework to examine how macro (historical, legislative, political, socio-economic factors), meso (sources of information, social support, social mobilization) and micro level factors (individual actions, behavioral changes) interacted to influence the response and behavior of women with respect to Zika in different contexts. METHODS: A qualitative study was carried out. Women were recruited through the snowball sampling technique from various locations in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the United States. They were of different nationalities and ethnicities. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The data transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Women in this study deemed the information provided as insufficient, which led them to actively reach out and access a variety of media sources. Social networks played a vital role in sharing information but also resulted in the spread of hoaxes or rumors. Participants in our research perceived socio-economic inequities but focused on how to remedy their microenvironments. They did not engage in major social activities. Lack of trust in governments placed women in vulnerable situations by preventing them to follow the guidance of health authorities. These impacts were also a result of the response tactics of health and government administrations in their failed attempts to ensure the well-being of their countries populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings call for public health interventions that go beyond individual level behavioral change campaigns, to more comprehensively address the broader meso and macro level factors that influence women willingness and possibility to protect themselves.","output":"Solidarity, vulnerability and mistrust: how context, information and government affect the lives of women in times of Zika"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Member of the dynamin family of large GTPases, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) dependent mitochondrial fission is an intricate process regulating both cellular and organ dynamics. Present study shows that NNV perturbs mitochondrial dynamics by promoting Drp-1 dependent mitochondrial fission, which attenuates MAVS mediated downstream signaling. NNV infected SISS cells revealed induction in Drp1 expression and subsequent translocation into mitochondria. The level of MAVS expression was up-regulated over a period of 24 hpi and declined with the progression of NNV infection at 48 and 72 hpi confirmed by western blot and mRNA transcript analysis. Drp-1 displayed its association with fragmented mitochondria and the transcript abundance was significant post infection along with Mff. Expression levels of IRF-3 IFN-1 and Mx followed a similar pattern with abundant expression at 48 hpi and diminished expression during the further period. Importantly, silencing of Drp1 caused significant elevation in the RLR downstream molecules and reduction in viral RNA expression. These results suggest that NNV-induced mitochondrial fission serve to attenuate host RLR signaling. This provides an illustration of hostCpathogen interaction in which the virus evades innate immunity by enhancing mitochondrial fission and perturbs MAVS, and the downstream molecules.","output":"Preliminary investigations on the role of Drp-1 dependent mitochondrial fission in attenuating RLR downstream signaling during nervous necrosis virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Based on social exchange theory, the study examines the influence of informational and relational internal communication on cognitive and affective responses and job engagement during organizational crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected by means of an online survey among people working in organizations with a minimum of 10 employees (N = 1,033) and analyzed using structural equation modeling Findings: Results show that informational and relational communication as organizational resources have a significant but distinct influence on how employees support their employer during the crisis While informational communication influences employees' acceptance of managerial decisions, relational communication exerts most influence on affective commitment, which is the strongest driver of job engagement Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design, specific crisis situation and geographic location are limitations of the study Practical implications: Delivering relevant information to employees quickly and reliably is important Yet, relationship-oriented communication that demonstrates appreciation and allows for participation has even stronger effects on job engagement, which is essential to mastering challenges arising from a crisis Social implications: During the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations demanded much from their employees In exchange, organizations should provide the resources information, status and love (Foa and Foa, 1980) by means of internal crisis communication Originality/value: The study demonstrates the role of different types of internal communication during organizational crises used to convey organizational resources, and it highlights the mediating role of acceptance and commitment to enhance employees' engagement at work ? 2021, Sabine Einwiller, Christopher Ruppel and Julia Stranzl","output":"Achieving employee support during the COVID-19 pandemic C the role of relational and informational crisis communication in Austrian organizations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The authors present efforts to build capacity at our institution for conducting systematic reviews and other forms of evidence synthesis through partnerships and a recharge model.

Case Presentation Throughout 2014 and 2015, library leadership proposed different models for getting institutional and financial support for librarians and staff to better support university researchers conducting systematic reviews. Though well received, initial requests for financial support were not funded. The executive director of the Health Sciences Library released two years' worth of salary and benefits to fund an evidence synthesis and retrieval librarian position. With this new position, the team formed a charge-back core facility in partnership with our university's Clinical Translation and Science Award hub. A series of procedural decisions and operational changes helped the group achieve success. Within eighteen months after launching the Systematic Review Core, we reached maximum capacity with more than twenty ongoing reviews. Discussion Assigning a dollar value to our expertise put us on par with other subject matter experts on campus and actually drove demand.

The SSP, GP1, and GP2 subunits of the trimeric glycoprotein complex noncovalently interact to stud the surface of virions and initiate arenavirus infectivity. Nascent glycoprotein production undergoes two proteolytic cleavage events: first within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cleave SSP from the remaining precursor GP1/2 (glycoprotein complex [GPC]) glycoprotein and second within the Golgi stacks by the cellular SKI-1/S1P for GP1/2 processing to yield GP1 and GP2 subunits. Cleaved SSP is not degraded but retained as an essential glycoprotein subunit. Here, we defined functions of the 58-amino-acid lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) SSP in regard to glycoprotein complex processing and maturation. Using molecular biology techniques, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry, we detected SSP at the plasma membrane of transfected cells. Further, we identified a sorting signal (FLLL) near the carboxyl terminus of SSP that is required for glycoprotein maturation and trafficking. In the absence of SSP, the glycoprotein accumulated within the ER and was unable to undergo processing by SKI-1/S1P. Mutation of this highly conserved FLLL motif showed impaired glycoprotein processing and secretory pathway trafficking, as well as defective surface expression and pH-dependent membrane fusion. Immunoprecipitation of SSP confirmed an interaction between the signal peptide and the GP2 subunit; however, mutations within this FLLL motif disrupted the association of the GP1 subunit with the remaining glycoprotein complex.","output":"Arenavirus Stable Signal Peptide Is the Keystone Subunit for Glycoprotein Complex Organization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Tobacco control policy audacity can make radical ideas seem possible, and set in motion a 'domino' effect, where precedents in one jurisdiction are followed by others.

Each case was summarised, then key themes identified and compared across jurisdictions to identify similarities and differences. RESULTS Included cases were Mauritius' ban on tobacco industry corporate social responsibility, Uruguay's tobacco single brand presentation regulations, New Zealand's Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Action Plan proposals and 2010 parliamentary Mori Affairs Select Committee Inquiry into the Tobacco Industry, Australia's plain packaging legislation, Balanga City's (Philippines) tobacco-free generation ordinance, Beverly Hills City Council's (USA) ordinance to ban tobacco sales and the Netherlands' policy plan to phase out online and supermarket tobacco sales. Each case was one strategy within a well-established comprehensive tobacco control and public health approach. Intersectoral and multijurisdiction collaboration, community engagement and public support, a strong theoretical evidence base and lessons learnt from previous tobacco control policies were important supportive factors, as was public support to ensure low political risk for policy makers.

Here we utilize a mutual information algorithm that classifies the information gain for CSS prediction provided by cytokine expression levels and clinical variables. Using this methodology, we found that a small number of clinical and cytokine expression variables are predictive of presenting COVID-19 disease severity, raising questions about the mechanism by which COVID-19 creates severe illness.

Number of patients with detected AF recurrences, time to first detected recurrence of AF, and AF burden were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty patients (9 females, mean age 57  11 years) were included. The mean duration of the follow-up was 382  38 days. A total of 17,573 (mean 351  111 per patient) TTM recordings were performed and 99.95% of recordings were of quality sufficient to assess cardiac rhythm. Altogether, 14 (28%) patients had AF recurrence. Holter ECG detected AF recurrence in 7 (14%) patients whereas TTM  in 12 (24%) patients, p = 0.0416 (TTM only  7 (14%), Holter ECG only  2 (4%), and both methods  5 (10%)).

Descriptive, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, scale reliability, item differential functioning, and measurement invariance tests were carried out. Results. We obtained a single-factor scale with excellent goodness-of-fit indices and high internal consistency (alpha = .90;omega = .93) adapted to the general Spanish population. We also found a significant relationship with depression (r = .72) and anxiety (r = .84). Gender invariance testing indicated that men and women understood the scale items differently, with differences also being found by age group. Conclusions. This is the first study attempting to assess the gender and age invariance of the FCV-19S scale. The scale demonstrates adequate psychometric properties, high internal consistency, and an appropriate relationship with depression and anxiety. Men and women in the general Spanish population have different perceptions of the fear of infection by COVID-19, and the fear affects some age groups more than others.

Methods: We analysed data on the individuals recruited between March 2014, and March 2020, within the study registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02078804. Swedish population registry data on educational level, household income, country of birth, and marital status were linked to each 60-year-old man and woman who had been randomised to two rounds of FIT 2 years apart (n = 60,123) or once-only PCOL (n = 30,390). Furthermore, we geo-coded each study individual to his/her residential area and assessed neighbourhood-level data on deprivation, proportion of non-Western immigrants, population density, and average distance to healthcare center for colonoscopy. We estimated adjusted associations of each covariate with the colonoscopy attendance proportion out of all invited to respective arms; ie, the preferred outcome for addressing health equity. In the FIT arm, the test uptake and the colonoscopy uptake among the test positives were considered as the secondary outcomes. Findings: We found a marked socioeconomic gradient in the colonoscopy attendance proportion in the PCOL arm (adjusted odds ratio [95% credibility interval] between the groups categorised in the highest vs. lowest national quartile for household income: 220 [201-242]) in parallel with the gradient in the test uptake of the FIT  2 screening (208 [196-220]). The corresponding gradient in the colonoscopy attendance proportion out of all invited to FIT was less pronounced (129 [116-142]), due to higher proportions of FIT positives in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Interpretation: The unintended risk of exacerbating inequalities in health by organised colorectal cancer screening may be higher with a PCOL strategy than a FIT strategy, despite parallel socioeconomic gradients in uptake.

These areas include business process analysis, healthcare workflow analysis and policy process analysis. This method is quite general and applicable to any situation in which declarative-type constraints of a modal and/or temporal nature play a part. A declarative process is a process in which activities may freely happen while respecting a set of constraints. For such a process, anything may happen so long as it is not explicitly forbidden. Declarative processes have been used and studied as models of business and healthcare workflows by several authors. In considering a declarative process as a model of some system it is natural to consider how the process behaves with respect to stakeholders. We derive a measure for stakeholder utility that can be applied in a very general setting. This derivation is achieved by listing a collection a properties which we argue such a stakeholder utility function ought to satisfy, and then using these to show a very specific form must hold for such a utility. The utility measure depends on the set of unique traces of the declarative process, and calculating this set requires a combinatorial analysis of the declarative graph that represents the process. This builds on previous work of the author wherein the combinatorial diversity metrics for declarative processes were derived for use in policy process analysis. The collection of stakeholder utilities can themselves then be used to form a metric with which we can compare different declarative processes to one another. These are illustrated using several examples of declarative processes that already exist in the literature.","output":"Stakeholder utility measures for declarative processes and their use in process comparisons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) provides access to interventions that are important for fostering development and improving quality of life. Thus, the timeliness of a diagnosis should not be limited by social-distancing limitations whenever possible.

At our Institute, we have adapted our approach to ASD evaluation to promote continued access to evaluation services during this unprecedented time. The purpose of this case series is to provide examples of three different approaches to ASD differential diagnostic services via telehealth that we have taken at our Institute. We illustrate our methods and clinical decision-making, based on patient characteristics and referral aims, in providing telehealth diagnostic services and discuss the advantages and limitations of telehealth utilization in the differential diagnosis of ASD. At our Institute, telehealth services have provided an invaluable opportunity to continue to confirm (or rule out) an ASD diagnosis when appropriate to facilitate access to services during this time.

Time to reach the peak of daily new confirmed cases and the maximum drop rate were used to measure the mitigation effectiveness, while the proportion of confirmed cases to population and the mortality rate were employed to evaluate the pandemic severity. Based on the mitigation effectiveness, the pandemic severity, and the mortality rate, the six sample countries were categorized into four types: high mitigation effectiveness vs. low pandemic severity, middle mitigation effectiveness vs. low pandemic severity, high mitigation effectiveness vs. high pandemic severity, and low mitigation effectiveness vs. high pandemic severity. The results found that Korea and China had relatively higher mitigation effectiveness and lower pandemic severity, while the USA and Brazil had the opposite.

CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) in 3 vessels (3VD) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 61% and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with routine hemodialysis. The patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He underwent surgery after COVID-19 screening using a checklist provided by the hospital. The patients condition worsened on the 3rd postoperative day in the ward, and he was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), reintubated, and tested for COVID-19 with a real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we excluded the other possible pneumonia causes (e.g., influenza). An RT-PCR test performed after surgery revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 tracing was performed for all health care providers and relatives; all results were negative except for 1 family member. The patient was treated for 4 days in the isolation ICU but died due to complications of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows the importance of testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before hospital admission for elective surgery and during the hospital stay, and the importance of developing rapid and accurate testing methods that can be used in countries and centers with limited health resources.","output":"A 48-Year-Old Man at Low Risk for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Who Underwent Planned Elective Triple-Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery at a National Heart Center in Indonesia Followed by a Fatal Case of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic has taken over the world in a storm.

At the same time, if we consider the University context, there is little attention paid during basic nursing education to emergency response, and faculty members report feeling poorly prepared to teach students about this topic. The present study aims to investigate how the Covid-19 pandemic condition influenced the psychological well-being of the Italian nursing students. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to Italian nursing students which contains two parts: a demographic section and the assessment to the psychological well-being nursing student with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: Given the emergency health situation from Covid-19, our initial concern was to find a large number of students with difficulties in mentally processing this situation even with problems such as depression, as their future profession is heavily involved in the management of this pandemic. Fortunately our results have denied our initial hypothesis since both the impact management levels of the event, assessed with the IES-R scale, and the depression levels, assessed with the PHQ-9 recorded values a??a??that were almost normal. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students are better able to face the situation since they find themselves in the role of spectators and not in the role of actors in the care of patients with Covid-19.

The use of remote cardiac telemetry as an alternative to 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) for continuous QTc monitoring may facilitate this strategy, but its application has not yet been validated or implemented. METHODS: In the validation component of this two-part prospective cohort study, a total of 65 hospitalized patients with simultaneous ECG and telemetry were identified. QTc obtained via remote telemetry as measured by 3 independent, blinded operators were compared with ECG as assessed by 2 board-certified electrophysiologists as the gold-standard. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the strength of linear correlation between the two methods. In a separate cohort comprised of 68 COVID-19 patients treated with combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, telemetry-based QTc values were compared at serial time points after medication administration using Friedman rank-sum test of repeated measures. RESULTS: Telemetry-based QTc measurements highly correlated with QTc values derived from ECG, with correlation coefficients of 0.74, 0.79, 0.85 (individual operators), and 0.84 (mean of all operators). Among the COVID-19 cohort, treatment led to a median QTc increase of 15 milliseconds between baseline and following the 9th dose (p = 0.002), with 8 (12%) patients exhibiting an increase in QTc &#8805; 60 milliseconds and 4 (6%) developing QTc &#8805; 500 milliseconds.

When IMV setting is extremely aggressive, especially through the application of high positive-end-expiratory respiration (PEEP) values, lung damage can occur. Until today, in COVID-19 patients, two types of ARDS were identified (L- and H-type); for the L-type, a lower PEEP strategy was supposed to be preferred, but data are still missing. The aim of this study was to evaluate if a clinical management with lower PEEP values in critically ill L-type COVID-19 patients was safe and efficient in comparison to usual standard of care. A retrospective analysis was conducted on consecutive patients with COVID-19 ARDS admitted to the ICU and treated with IMV. Patients were treated with a lower PEEP strategy adapted to BMI: PEEP 10 cmH(2)O if BMI < 30 kg m(?2), PEEP 12 cmH(2)O if BMI 30C50 kg m(?2), PEEP 15 cmH(2)O if BMI > 50 kg m(?2). Primary endpoint was the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio evolution during the first 3 IMV days; secondary endpoints were to analyze ICU length of stay (LOS) and IMV length.

For example, if a language has no case marking, it is likely to rely on word order as a cue for identification of grammatical roles. Such inverse correlations are interpreted as manifestations of language users tendency to use language efficiently. The present study argues that this interpretation is problematic. Linguistic variables, such as the presence of case, or flexibility of word order, are aggregate properties, which do not represent the use of linguistic cues in context directly. Still, such variables can be useful for circumscribing the potential role of communicative efficiency in language evolution, if we move from cross-linguistic trade-offs to multivariate causal networks. This idea is illustrated by a case study of linguistic variables related to four types of Subject and Object cues: case marking, rigid word order of Subject and Object, tight semantics and verb-medial order. The variables are obtained from online language corpora in thirty languages, annotated with the Universal Dependencies. The causal model suggests that the relationships between the variables can be explained predominantly by sociolinguistic factors, leaving little space for a potential impact of efficient linguistic behavior.","output":"Cross-Linguistic Trade-Offs and Causal Relationships Between Cues to Grammatical Subject and Object, and the Problem of Efficiency-Related Explanations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global healthcare sector is currently in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, a 'low-chance, high-impact' event which will require healthcare systems, and the organisations within them, to maintain organisational resilience in order to respond effectively However, contrary to the instinctive reaction to tighten control, the quality of response depends on healthcare systems' capacity to loosen control and, subsequently, enhance improvisation Three factors critical to enhancing an organisation's capacity for improvisation are highlighted;increasing autonomy, maintaining structure and creating a shared understanding By drawing on the case of Christchurch Hospital's response to a major earthquake, this paper demonstrates the vital role that improvisation can play within a clinical setting, when responding to a low-chance, high-impact event","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: resilient organisational response to a low-chance, high-impact event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Most of the studies regarding the surgical treatment of severe laryngomalacia (LM) have been aimed at describing the efficacy of the treatment in terms of improvement of clinical symptoms or anatomical findings.

METHODS Retrospective chart review of 81 infants who underwent supra-glottoplasty (SGP) for severe laryngomalacia between 2011 and 2020 at Bambino Ges Children's Hospital of Rome, Italy. Among the patients, 47 (58%) were male and 34 (42%) were female. Twenty-one patients (26%) had one or more comorbidities condition. The data collected included age, symptoms, a polysomnography/pulse oximetry study, growth rate, the findings from flexible endoscopy, pre- and post-supra-glottoplasty (SGP) pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and, when indicated, 24 h pH-metry. Breathing patterns were studied during restful, normal sleep, using an ultrasonic flow-meter (Exhalyzer, Viasys) which measured: Tidal Volume (Vt), Respiratory Rate (RR), time to peak expiratory flow/expiratory time ratio (tPTEF/Te, an index of the patency of the lower airways) and mean expiratory/mean inspiratory flow ratio (MEF/MIF, an index of the patency of the upper airways) evaluated before surgical procedure (T1) and 3-6 weeks after (T2). Pre- and post-operative mean data were calculated and comparisons made with a Student T-test. RESULTS The surgical procedure was well tolerated by all infants and no intraoperative or post-operatory long-term complications were noted. In T1, breathing patterns were characterized by low tidal volume and high tPTEF/Te and MEF/MIF ratios, suggesting a severe reduction in the patency of the upper airways in all patients. After surgery (T2), all the previously mentioned variables significantly improved, reaching normal values for the child's age. CONCLUSIONS Supra-glottoplasty, as already described in several studies, is a safe and efficient procedure to treat severe laryngomalacia during infancy. The improvement in breathing patterns after surgery was reliably confirmed by a lung function test in our study, which showed the diagnostic value of testing respiratory functionality in the laryngomalacia and comparing them to clinical and endoscopic data. Moreover, considering the results obtained, we also propose the use of this available, dependable test to verify its therapeutic effects (post-surgery) and to monitor future respiratory development in these infants. Moreover, we believe that further studies will provide detailed grading guidelines for gravity of the LM, based on these functional lung tests.","output":"Changes in Breathing Patterns after Surgery in Severe Laryngomalacia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Annemarie Brown considers patient factors affecting the appropriateness of self-care for chronic wounds.","output":"Managing chronic wounds in the community: should we be promoting self-care?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB), a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, is particularly relevant in low/middle-income countries like India, where the disease is endemic.

For instance, upon issuing payment transactions, users of an application would like to be notified quickly on the transactions approval. The application can be a financial institution (such as a bank), sharing the blockchain with other such applications and is represented by a node. A node might attempt to prioritize its own transactions by including them early in blocks added to the blockchain. A fair block proposal of a node follows a random selection of the transactions among the set of pending transactions the node is aware of. On the contrary, a dishonest node includes more of its transactions at the expense of transactions of other applications. In this work, we propose a toolbox of techniques to enforce such a fair block selection. First, we design an accurate statistical test for the honesty of a proposal and explain it. We conduct experiments demonstrating the accuracy of the new validation scheme.

We aimed to investigate the association between the SARS-CoV-2 antibody status at baseline and subsequent infection in this population. Methods We did a prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in staff (aged &lt;65 years) and residents (aged &gt;65 years) at 100 LTCFs in England between Oct 1, 2020, and Feb 1, 2021. Blood samples were collected between June and November, 2020, at baseline, and 2 and 4 months thereafter and tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done weekly in staff and monthly in residents. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, adjusted for age and sex, and stratified by LTCF. Findings 682 residents from 86 LCTFs and 1429 staff members from 97 LTCFs met study inclusion criteria. At baseline, IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 (33%) of 682 residents and 408 (29%) of 1429 staff members. 93 (20%) of 456 residents who were antibody-negative at baseline had a PCR-positive test (infection rate 0.054 per month at risk) compared with four (2%) of 226 residents who were antibody-positive at baseline (0.007 per month at risk). 111 (11%) of 1021 staff members who were antibody-negative at baseline had PCR-positive tests (0.042 per month at risk) compared with ten (2%) of 408 staff members who were antibody-positive staff at baseline (0.009 per month at risk). The risk of PCR-positive infection was higher for residents who were antibody-negative at baseline than residents who were antibody-positive at baseline (adjusted HR [aHR] 0.15, 95% CI 0.05-0.44, p=0.0006), and the risk of a PCR-positive infection was also higher for staff who were antibody-negative at baseline compared with staff who were antibody-positive at baseline (aHR 0.39, 0.19-0.82;p=0.012). 12 of 14 reinfected participants had available data on symptoms, and 11 of these participants were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid proteins were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. Interpretation The presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid protein was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection.

They are often defined through a mathematical compartmental model of the epidemic, like a stochastic SEIR model, whose parameters must be estimated from multiple time series of epidemiological data. Because of very high dimensional parameter spaces (partly due to the stochasticity in the spread models) and incomplete and delayed data, inference is very challenging.

Since that time there has been rapid spread and considerable mortality and morbidity. The immunology of COVID-19 is still being determined in the general population as well as select groups such as pregnant females whose immune response may be altered. Here we present a case of questionable relapse vs reinfection of COVID-19 in a pregnant health care worker. Case description A 32 year old female healthcare worker, with no significant past medical history developed slight shortness of breath and loss of taste and smell soon after she discovered about her first pregnancy. She subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 in April 2020. At that time she was at six weeks gestation. She never developed a fever, cough, GI symptoms, malaise, muscle fatigue or sore throat. Because her symptoms were mild and stable, and she never required oxygen supplements, she was asked to quarantine at home, and to take the needed precautions. Telephone visits have been conducted daily to check on her clinical status and patient had access to pulse oximetry and thermostat and therefore has been keeping track of her vital signs and wellbeing. In May 2020 - one month after initial infection- she reported total clearance of her initial symptoms and she has been preparing to return to work. She however reported that she has had contact COVID-19 positive individuals. Because of that she has been retested prior to returning to work. Nasopharyngeal swab was performed and PCR was negative. Two weeks later, she reported acute onset on dyspnea on exertion, and loss of taste and smell. Nasopharyngeal swab was performed and PCR was positive. She experienced mild symptoms and was quarantined home. One month later, she reported resolution of symptoms and repeat COVID19 testing was negative. Discussion Studies have shown that post infection immunity has conferred for at least 3-6 month. Clinical course and prognosis of COVID19 in pregnancy has been found to be associated with more complications and rapid clinical deterioration. Hence, frequent ICU admissions and need for mechanical ventilation were noticed in pregnant COVID19 infected females, however, limited data is available on post infection immunity in pregnancy. Hence, it remains unknown if this presented patient has experienced relapse of an initial infection or if given her immunosuppressed state in setting of pregnancy she has re-acquired the infection.","output":"Relapse Versus Reinfection: A Case of Recurrence of COVID-19 Infection during Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A systematic review of blockchain application in healthcare quality improvement was undertaken in this paper.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of XBJ on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its effects on IL-6 and tumor necrosis alpha TNF-. METHODS A total of 42 patients, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with XBJ combined with routine treatment at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital between January 20, 2020, and March 11, 2020, were selected as the observation group. A control group comprising 16 patients who received routine treatment was also established, and cases were matched from the observation group on a 1:1 basis according to age, comorbidities, and mild and severe disease. The clinical symptoms, laboratory test indexes, and changes in computed tomography (CT) scans of patients in the two groups were observed at the time of admission and 7 days after treatment, and the time taken for the patients to produce a negative nucleic acid test was also recorded. RESULTS There were no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups. After treatment, there were significant improvements in IL-6 levels and body temperature in the observation group as compared with the control group. Particularly in severe patients, the reduction in body temperature in the observation group was greater than that in the control group (P<0.05). A higher number of patients in the observation group showed improved CT imaging results compared with the control group, and the time taken to produce a negative nucleic acid test was shorter in the observation group than in the control group; however, the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in TNF- and IL-10 between the two groups.

The general public lacked good knowledge of SARS and MERS at the early stage of epidemics. Some people's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 had been improved, but the health behaviors of some special groups including children and their parents need to be strengthened. Negative emotions including fear and stigmatization occurred during the outbreaks. Reliable health information was needed to improve public awareness and mental health for infectious diseases.

There were no pathological findings at physical examination. The electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST elevation. Laboratory tests showed a significant increment of Troponin I levels (4697 ng/l  6236 ng/l after 3 h), White Blood Cells (17 610/mmc) and C-Reactive Protein (8.36 mg/dl). Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function with no evidence of pericarditis. These findings were consistent with a probable case of acute myocarditis. Cardiac magnetic imaging demonstrated myocardial oedema of the posterior wall of the left ventricle at T2-weighted images, with patchy areas of subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement. Based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention myocarditis diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of acute myocarditis was made and treatment with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs was started. Regarding etiology agent determination, in the COVID19 era, the first suspect was anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-vaccine-induced myocarditis. Several case series and analyses of a large national health care organization database helped to identify features linked to these types of myocarditis. The highest incidence was observed among male juvenile subjects, usually 48C72 h after the second dose of vaccination, with elevated levels of spike antibody for SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, in the presented clinical case, the patient had received the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccination two days before hospital admission and showed negative serology tests for SARS-CoV-2. In recent medical history, two days before the onset of fever and chest pain, the patient had episodes of diarrhea which persisted during the first week of hospitalization. All immunological and microbiological tests result negative, except for a stool culture positive for Campylobacter coli. Interestingly a revision of literature showed several cases of myocarditis linked to Campylobacter species. In particular, of 13 reported cases, 12 (92%) were male with a mean age of 26  8.8 years, and cardiac symptoms present generally 2C4 days after diarrhea. In this particular setting, the first and more obvious hypothesis was strongly questioned because of an unexpected finding in the stool culture. In fact, Campylobacter spp. related myocarditis is an extremely rare condition, even if this pathogen is associated with important immunological interferences, as shown by its relationship with the Guillain-Barre syndrome. Further, myocarditis related to mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is considered a rare complication. We hypothesized that the association of the two components could have acted synergistically to produce an immune system activation against cardiac muscle. Additional investigations are required to clarify the link between vaccination and possible improper immune response. In conclusion, this case represents a typical example in which the cause of the disease should be well investigated because the initial etiological theory is not definitive, especially in the SARS-CoV-2 era.","output":"740 A case of acute Campylobacter COLI myocarditis post-mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Due to its rapid progression of neurological dysfunction, it is considered an oncologic emergency that demands prompt diagnosis and management. Most cases of MSCC occur from breast, lung, and prostate primaries. MSCC secondary to carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland is rare. Case presentation: We report a 32-year-old Filipino ex-smoker male complaining of two-week history of progressive paresis associated with urinary and bowel retention. He had a history of total unilateral neck dissection for CEPA of the parotid gland last year followed by systemic chemotherapy with CAP regimen (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, cisplatin 50 mg/m2) for four cycles. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, he lost to follow-up. On examination, physical examination revealed an 8 x 8 cm recurrent fungating mass at the right post-auricular area with extension to the buccal cavity. Motor strength was 0/5 for both lower extremities with associated hyporeflexia. Sensation to pain, temperature, and proprioception was noted to be absent at the level of the umbilicus and below. Contrast-enhanced chest and abdominopelvic CT scan revealed mixed lytic-sclerotic osseous foci at the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies, multiple intramuscular soft tissue foci, as well as bilateral lung and pleural-based nodules. Whole body bone scan showed multiple bone metastases. Radiation therapy to the spine was given at a total of 30 cGy in 10 fractions. Intravenous dexamethasone and bone resorption therapy were given. Palliative chemotherapy (paclitaxel 200 mg/m2, carboplatin AUC 6 mgmin/mL) was subsequently started. Conclusion: Although relatively rare, MSCC should be taken into consideration when a patient with history of CEPA presents with paraplegia. Prompt diagnosis and management are particularly important in preventing permanent neurological damage.","output":"P54-5 Metastatic spinal cord compression caused by recurrent carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The psychological impact of COVID-19 on Health Care Workers (HCWs) has been widely reported. Few studies have sought to examine HCWs personal models of COVID-19 utilising an established theoretical framework. We undertook a mixed methods study of beliefs about COVID-19 held by HCWs in the Mid-West and South of Ireland during the first and third waves of COVID-19. Template analysis was undertaken on the free text responses of 408 HCWs about their perceptions of the Cause of COVID-19 as assessed by the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ). Responses were re-examined in the same cohort for stability at 3 months follow-up (n = 100). This analytic template was subsequently examined in a new cohort (n = 253) of HCWs in the third wave. Female HCWs perceived greater emotional impact of COVID-19 than men (t = -4.31, df405, p < 0.01). Differences between occupational groups were evident in relation to Timeline (F4,401 = 3.47, p < 0.01), Treatment Control (F4,401 = 5.64, p < 0.001) and Concerns about COVID-19 (F4,401 = 3.68, p < 0.01). Administration staff believed that treatment would be significantly more helpful and that COVID-19 would last a shorter amount of time than medical/nursing staff and HSCP. However, administration staff were significantly more concerned than HSCP about COVID-19. Template analysis on 1059 responses to the Cause items of the B-IPQ identified ten higher order categories of perceived Cause of COVID-19. The top two Causes identified at both Waves were 'individual behavioural factors' and 'overseas travel'. This study has progressed our understanding of the models HCWs hold about COVID-19 over time, and has highlighted the utility of the template analysis approach in analysing free-text questionnaire data.

In addition to the routine laboratory parameters of the groups, their native thiol (NT), total thiol (TT) and disulphide levels were measured. Primarily, we compared COVID-19 patients to the healthy control group for inflammatory parameters, NT, TT and disulphide levels. Then, COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of the disease as mild to moderate and severe COVID-19, and the three groups were compared with each other. Predictive value of thiol parameters in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and in the determining its severity, and its correlation with presence and duration of symptoms were investigated. Severe COVID-19 patients had lower NT and TT levels compared with healthy controls and mild to moderate patients (P < 0.001 for both). The results of ROC analysis show that the greatest AUC was IL-6 and NT (AUC = 0.97, AUC = 0.96, respectively) between control and COVID-19 patients, while it was CRP and NT (AUC = 0.85, AUC = 0.83) between mild to moderate and severe patients.

Severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and there is still an ongoing debate on whether COVID-19 ARDS and its perfusion defect differs from ARDS induced by other causes. Beside pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1  [IL-1] or IL-6), several main pathological phenomena have been seen because of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction: hypercoagulation reflected by fibrin degradation products called D-dimers, micro- and macrothrombosis and pathological angiogenesis. Direct endothelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to occur and ACE-2 expression by EC is a matter of debate. Indeed, endothelial damage reported in severely ill patients with COVID-19 could be more likely secondary to infection of neighboring cells and/or a consequence of inflammation. Endotheliopathy could give rise to hypercoagulation by alteration in the levels of different factors such as von Willebrand factor. Other than thrombotic events, pathological angiogenesis is among the recent findings. Overexpression of different proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) or placental growth factors (PlGF) have been found in plasma or lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an emergency myelopoiesis associated to deregulated immunity and mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells, leading to features of acquired hematological malignancies or cardiovascular disease, which are discussed in this review. Altogether, this review will try to elucidate the pathophysiology of thrombotic complications, pathological angiogenesis and EC dysfunction, allowing better insight in new targets and antithrombotic protocols to better address vascular system dysfunction.

We developed an ordinary differential equation-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model with Bayesian underpinning to estimate the main parameter of R(0) determined by transmission coefficients, incubation period, and the recovery rate. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method was used to tackle the parameters of uncertainty resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19 given a small cohort of the cruise ship. The extended stratified SEIR model was also proposed to elucidate the heterogeneity of transmission route by the level of deck with passengers and crews. With the application of the overall model, R(0) was estimated as high as 5.70 (95% credible interval: 4.23C7.79). The entire epidemic period without containment measurements was approximately 47 days and reached the peak one month later after the index case. The partial containment measure reduced 63% (95% credible interval: 60C66%) infected passengers. With the deck-specific SEIR model, the heterogeneity of R(0) estimates by each deck was noted. The estimated R(0) figures were 5.18 for passengers (5C14 deck), mainly from the within-deck transmission, and 2.46 for crews (2C4 deck), mainly from the between-deck transmission. Modelling the dynamic of COVID-19 on the cruise ship not only provides an insight into timely evacuation and early isolation and quarantine but also elucidates the relative contributions of different transmission modes on the cruise ship though the deck-stratified SEIR model.

Rigorous effectiveness evaluations of large-scale implementation initiatives using quasi-experimental designs are needed to inform expansion efforts. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) initiative to increase MOUD use in nonaddiction clinics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement initiative used interrupted time series design to compare trends in MOUD receipt. Primary care, pain, and mental health clinics in the VA health care system (n = 35) located at 18 intervention facilities and nonintervention comparison clinics (n = 35) were matched on preimplementation MOUD prescribing trends, clinic size, and facility complexity. The cohort of patients with OUD who received care in intervention or comparison clinics in the year after September 1, 2018, were evaluated. The preimplementation period extended from September 1, 2017, through August 31, 2018, and the postimplementation period from September 1, 2018, through August 31, 2019. EXPOSURES: The multifaceted implementation intervention included education, external facilitation, and quarterly reports. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were the proportion of patients receiving MOUD and the number of patients per clinician prescribing MOUD. Segmented logistic regression evaluated monthly proportions of MOUD receipt 1 year before and after initiative launch, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Poisson regression models examined yearly changes in clinician prescribing over the same time frame. RESULTS: Overall, 7488 patients were seen in intervention clinics (mean [SD] age, 53.3 [14.2] years; 6858 [91.6%] male; 1476 [19.7%] Black, 417 [5.6%] Hispanic; 5162 [68.9%] White; 239 [3.2%] other race [including American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and multiple races]; and 194 [2.6%] unknown) and 7558 in comparison clinics (mean [SD] age, 53.4 [14.0] years; 6943 [91.9%] male; 1463 [19.4%] Black; 405 [5.4%] Hispanic; 5196 [68.9%] White; 244 [3.2%] other race; 250 [3.3%] unknown). During the preimplementation year, the proportion of patients receiving MOUD in intervention clinics increased monthly by 5.0% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07). Accounting for this preimplementation trend, the proportion of patients receiving MOUD increased monthly by an additional 2.3% (AOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04) during the implementation year. Comparison clinics increased by 2.6% monthly before implementation (AOR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04), with no changes detected after implementation. Although preimplementation-year trends in monthly MOUD receipt were similar in intervention and comparison clinics, greater increases were seen in intervention clinics after implementation (AOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08). Patients treated with MOUD per clinician in intervention clinics saw greater increases from before to after implementation compared with comparison clinics (incidence rate ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.28-1.77).

False news, conspiracy theories, and magical cures were shared with the general public at an alarming rate, which may lead to increased anxiety and stress levels and associated debilitating consequences. OBJECTIVES: To measure the level of COVID-19 information overload (COVIO) and assess the association between COVIO and sociodemographic characteristics among the general public. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between April and May 2020 using a modified Cancer Information Overload scale. The survey was developed and posted on four social media platforms. The data were only collected from those who consented to participate. COVIO score was classified into high vs. low using the asymmetrical distribution as a guide and conducted a binary logistic regression to examine the factors associated with COVIO. RESULTS: A total number of 584 respondents participated in this study. The mean COVIO score of the respondents was 19.4 ( 4.0). Sources and frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were found to be significant predictors of COVIO. Participants who received information via the broadcast media were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information via the social media (adjusted odds ratio ([aOR],14.599; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.608-132.559; p = 0.017). Also, participants who received COVID-19 information every minute (aOR, 3.892; 95% CI, 1.124-13.480; p = 0.032) were more likely to have high COVIO than those who received information every week. CONCLUSION: The source of information and the frequency of receiving COVID-19 information were significantly associated with COVIO.

It implies change attitude of managers, teachers and students to reformulate educational practices (sometimes with traditional tools), with innovative practices preserving a methodology that provides to the student criticality reflection, dialogue, bonding and interaction; elements that are part of a training aimed at transformation, empowerment and not just the transmission of knowledge. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic caused paradigm shifts perhaps not yet overcome by health science institutions , because when they perceived themselves within a reality that generated changes in the political, economic, cultural and social aspects at a global level, they had to reinvent and insert new ways of teaching in their work process; they had to discuss different educational approaches and, given the needs to readjust health teaching methods, they inserted remote technologies as essential tools to meet the real need for continuity of classes in non-face-to-face model.

To understand the significance of the vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology, computational approaches were applied to transcriptomic datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of such patients or healthy individuals. Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes modulated by vitamin D were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patients cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Network analysis of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes identified pathways in the immune system, NF-KB/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results provided computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D pathway in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Evidence of a dysregulated Vitamin D pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients lung cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Experts have recommended exercise for improved sleep, but often with the caveat that one should avoid nighttime exercise. The aim of this study was to challenge this recommendation in a sample who might be most prone to sleep impairment after nighttime exercise. The secondary aims were to assess whether or not post-treatment sleep was correlated with anxiolytic effects or downregulation of body temperature. METHODS: Twelve sedentary adults with insomnia completed two treatments (separated by 2-5 days) in counterbalanced order: (1) 30 min of moderate treadmill exercise (60-70% maximum heart rate) + 15 min of moderate resistance exercise and (2) a control treatment (reading). Each treatment was completed 2 h before bedtime and followed by a 10-min shower, a light snack, 8 h of polysomnographic recording, and a sleep questionnaire. State anxiety was assessed before and 30 min after each treatment and 10 min before bedtime. Body temperature was assessed from pre-exercise to wake time. RESULTS: No significant treatment differences in sleep were found, and Hedges g paired comparisons indicated small effect sizes; however, two participants had severely disturbed objective sleep following exercise. Significant correlations were found between change in state anxiety from pre-exercise to bedtime and TST (r = 0.69, p = 0.03).

We conducted a cross-sectional study of case interview data from March 10 to June 1, 2021 to estimate the prevalence of suspect reinfection cases;describe the interval between repeat positives  90 days;and, estimate bivariate prevalence odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for suspect reinfections and age, sex, race/ethnicity, reason for testing, symptomology, and comorbidities. Results From March 10 to June 1, 2021, we attempted 29,983 case interviews, including 1,901 (6.3%) suspect reinfection cases and 28,082 (93.7%) initial cases. Among suspect reinfection cases, the median interval between repeat positive tests was 117 days (interquartile range: 102, 141).

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a teleguided intervention on emotional disorders in patients with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study was performed during the social distancing period in the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil. Individuals with type 1 diabetes aged  18 years were selected to receive a teleguided multidisciplinary intervention or the usual care plus an educational website access. The proposed intervention aimed addressing aspects of mental health, diabetes care and lifestyle habits during the pandemic. The feasibility outcome included the assessment of recruitment capability and adherence to the proposed intervention. Moreover, we evaluated the presence of positive screening for emotional disorders (Self Report Questionnaire 20) after a 16-week intervention, patients perceptions of pandemic-related changes, diabetes-related emotional distress, eating disorders, and sleep disorders. Data were analyzed with the intent\\\\to\\\\treat principle. Fifty-eight individuals (mean age, 43.8  13.6 years) were included (intervention group, n = 29; control group, n = 29). At the end of the study, a total of 5 participants withdrew from the study in the intervention group compared to only 1 in the control group. Participants who dropout from the study had similar mean age, sex and income to those who remained in the study. The analysis of mental health disorders was not different between the groups at the follow up: a positive screening result was found in 48.3% and 34.5% of participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively (P = 0.29).

Membrane fractions prepared from a stably transfected hCD13-positive murine NIH/3T3 cell line were used to immunize BALB/c mice, with the intention that hCD13 would be the major immunogenic molecule recognized by the immune system. Spleen RNA from the immunized mice served to generate a combinatorial scFv phage display library. The library was adsorbed against non-transfected NIH/3T3 or Sf21 insect cells to eliminate nonrelevant binders. The supernatant was then used for panning with either hCD13-transfected Sf21 insect cells or a hCD13-expressing human leukemia-derived cell line. Therefore, the key concepts of the procedure were the presentation of hCD13 as the sole human antigen on murine NIH/3T3 cells and a screening strategy where hCD13 was the major common antigen of the material used for immunization and panning. Two different hCD13-reactive phages were isolated and the soluble scFvs were expressed in E. coli and purified. The two scFvs, anti-hCD13-1 and anti-hCD13-3, differed at four amino acid positions in their VH regions and both had high affinities for hCD13 as determined by surface plasmon resonance (K D=7 and 3310?10 M, respectively). Both efficiently recognized hCD13 on intact cells. Therefore, the procedure allowed the production of high affinity scFvs reacting with a desired antigen in its native conformation without requiring extensive purification of the antigen and should be useful for the preparation of scFvs against other conformation-sensitive cell-surface antigens.","output":"An improved procedure for the generation of recombinant single-chain Fv antibody fragments reacting with human CD13 on intact cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has focused our attention on airborne droplet transmission.

Transmission risks are evaluated based on SARS-CoV-2 viral deposition on a person standing 1 m or 2 m away from the cougher. Our results show that the travel distance for a 100 m droplet can be up to 6.6 m under a wind speed of 2 m/s. This can be further increased under dry conditions. We found that the travel distance of a small droplet is relatively insensitive to relative humidity. For a millimetric droplet, the projected distance can be more than 1 m, even in still air. Significantly greater droplets and viral deposition are found on a body 1 m away from a cougher, compared to 2 m.

OBJECTIVE To describe the effect of acute severe hypercapnia (PaCO2 >70 mm Hg) on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and cerebral oxygenation in newborn infants. STUDY DESIGN Observational study of full-term and preterm infants with acute severe hypercapnia (identified by arterial blood gas measurements), monitored with aEEG. Visual analysis of the aEEG was performed in all infants. In preterm infants <32 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), analysis of two-channel EEG was performed. Mean spontaneous activity transients (SAT) rate (SATs/min), interval between SATs (ISI in seconds) and the ISI percentage (ISP) were calculated for 10-min periods before, during and after hypercapnia. Mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) measured with near-infrared spectroscopy were also calculated for these periods. RESULTS Twenty-five infants (21 preterm, 4 full-term) comprising 32 episodes of acute severe hypercapnia were identified. Twenty-seven episodes were accompanied by a transient aEEG depression. Twenty-two episodes in 15 preterm infants <32 weeks PMA were quantitatively analysed. During hypercapnia, SAT rate decreased and ISI and ISP increased significantly. No significant change occurred in rScO2 or FTOE during hypercapnia. CONCLUSION Profound depression of brain activity due to severe hypercapnia is also seen in infants.

Today one of the most important challenges is predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 in the context of other inflammatory diseases such as traumatic injuries. Many diseases with inflammatory properties are usually polyphasic and the kinetics of inflammatory mediators in various inflammatory diseases might be different. To find the most appropriate evaluation time of immune mediators to accurately predict COVID-19 prognosis in the trauma environment, researchers must investigate and compare cellular and molecular alterations based on their kinetics after the start of COVID-19 symptoms and traumatic injuries. The current review aimed to investigate the similarities and differences of common inflammatory mediators (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, and serum amyloid A), cytokine/chemokine levels (IFNs, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, IL-10, and IL-4), and immune cell subtypes (neutrophil, monocyte, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg and CTL) based on the kinetics between patients with COVID-19 and trauma.

The study of ion-induced biodamage using the phenomenon-based MultiScale Approach to the physics of radiation damage with ions (MSA) has led to the prediction of nanoscale shock waves (SW) that are created by ions in the biological medium at the high linear energy transfer (LET). The high-LET regime corresponding to energy losses higher than 1 keV/nm is typical for ions heavier than carbon in biological media at the Bragg peak region. This paper reveals that the thermomechanical stress of the DNA molecule by the ion-induced SW becomes the dominant mechanism of complex DNA damage at the high-LET ion irradiation. Damage of the DNA molecule in water caused by the ion-induced SW is studied by means of reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Five projectile ions (C, O, Si, Ar, and Fe) at the Bragg peak energies are considered. Simulations reveal that Ar and, especially, Fe ions induce multiple bond breakages in a DNA segment containing 20 base pairs. The DNA damage produced in segments of such size leads to complex irreparable lesions in a cell. This makes the SW-induced thermomechanical stress the dominant mechanism of complex DNA damage at the high-LET ion irradiation. A detailed theory for evaluating the DNA damage caused by ions at high-LET is formulated and integrated into the MSA formalism. The theoretical analysis reveals that a single ion hitting a cell nucleus at high-LET is sufficient to produce highly complex, lethal damages to a cell by the SW-induced thermomechanical stress. A good agreement of the calculated cell survival probabilities with experimental data obtained for the cell irradiation with iron ions provides strong experimental evidence of the ion-induced SW effect.","output":"Lethal DNA damages caused by ion-induced shock waves in cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Despite the danger of infection during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan, many patients still need surgical treatment. Most elective surgeries were delayed because of the public health emergency. However, when patients have life-threatening emergencies or illnesses, surgeries are often needed as soon as possible. Moreover, due to hospital overcrowding during the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare professionals initially struggled to address the issue due to a lack of experience. This is especially true for day surgery centers with higher patient mobility. Methods. We remodeled pathways to separate patients and medical personnel to minimize the COVID-19 infection rate. Further, strategies for medical staff education and potential patient education, ward disinfection and maintenance, setup with 3 more screening stations, patient and companion management, medical staff management, and perioperative management were implemented before starting elective day surgery. Results. From February 11 to March 11 in 2020, 202 day surgeries were performed. These were all elective surgeries and included ultrasound-guided Mammotome biopsy, endoscopic polypectomy, hernia repair, pediatric surgeries, cholecystectomy, choledochoscopy, radical mastectomy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage, liver biopsy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, laparoscopic resection of colon cancer, colostomy apotheosis, and varicose vein surgery.

Serial serum samples were collected and tested for antibody response using four point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) (ALLTEST 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, Dynamiker 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test, ASK COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test, and Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test). Time-dependent detection sensitivity and timeliness of seroconversion were determined and compared between the four POC rapid tests. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the four tests for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after 3 weeks of symptom onset were 100% and 100%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the rapid tests used for detection of IgM and IgG separately and those used for detection of combined total antibody (mainly IgM/IgG). There was no significant difference between the four POC rapid tests in terms of time required for determining seroconversion of COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 with pneumonia demonstrated shorter seroconversion time than those without pneumonia.

An alternative, Nomon, allows potential selections to be arranged arbitrarily rather than requiring a grid (as desired for gaming, drawing, etc.) -- and provides an alternative probabilistic selection method. While past results suggest that Nomon may be faster and easier to use than row-column scanning, no work has yet quantified performance of the two methods over longer time periods or in tasks beyond writing. In this paper, we also develop and validate a webcam-based switch that allows a user without a motor impairment to approximate the response times of a motor-impaired single switch user; although the approximation is not a replacement for testing with single-switch users, it allows us to better initialize, calibrate, and evaluate our method. Over 10 sessions with the webcam switch, we found users typed faster and more easily with Nomon than with row-column scanning. The benefits of Nomon were even more pronounced in a picture-selection task. Evaluation and feedback from a motor-impaired switch user further supports the promise of Nomon.","output":"A Performance Evaluation of Nomon: A Flexible Interface for Noisy Single-Switch Users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Obese body habitus is a challenging issue to address in lumbar spine surgery. There is a lack of consensus on the long-term influence of BMI on patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction. This study aimed to examine the differences in patient-reported outcomes over the course of 12 and 24 months among BMI classifications of patients who underwent lumbar surgery. METHODS A search was performed using the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) Spine Registry from 2012 to 2018 to identify patients who underwent lumbar surgery and had either a 12- or 24-month follow-up. Patients were categorized based on their BMI as normal weight ( 25 kg/m2), overweight (25-30 kg/m2), obese (30-40 kg/m2), and morbidly obese (> 40 kg/m2). Outcomes included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the visual analog scale (VAS) for back pain (BP) and leg pain (LP), and patient satisfaction was measured at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS A total of 31,765 patients were included. At both the 12- and 24-month follow-ups, those who were obese and morbidly obese had worse ODI, VAS-BP, and VAS-LP scores (all p < 0.01) and more frequently rated their satisfaction as \\"I am the same or worse than before treatment\\" (all p < 0.01) compared with those who were normal weight. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the BMI cutoffs for predicting worsening disability and surgery dissatisfaction were 30.1 kg/m2 and 29.9 kg/m2 for the 12- and 24-month follow-ups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Higher BMI was associated with poorer patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction at both the 12- and 24-month follow-ups. BMI of 30 kg/m2 is the cutoff for predicting worse patient outcomes after lumbar surgery.","output":"Long-term impact of obesity on patient-reported outcomes and patient satisfaction after lumbar spine surgery: an observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trichoepitheliomas (TE) are benign skin tumours of the pilosebaceous apocrine unit with follicular differentiation.

The indoor place is considered to be a significant epidemic spreading risk origin, but existing widely-used epidemic spreading models are usually limited for indoor places since the dynamic physical distance changes between people are ignored, and the empirical features of the essential and non-essential travel are not differentiated. In this paper, we introduce a pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model that is capable of modeling indoor transmission risks of diseases during peoples social activities. Taking advantage of the before-and-after mobility data from the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, its found that people tend to spend more time in grocery stores once their travel frequencies are restricted to a low level. In other words, an increase in dwell time could balance the decrease in travel frequencies and satisfy peoples demands. Based on the pedestrian-based model and the empirical evidence, combined non-pharmaceutical interventions from different operational levels are evaluated. Numerical simulations show that restrictions on peoples travel frequency and open hours of indoor places may not be universally effective in reducing average infection risks for each pedestrian who visit the place. Entry limitations can be a widely effective alternative, whereas the decision-maker needs to balance the decrease in risky contacts and the increase in queue length outside the place that may impede people from fulfilling their travel needs. The results show that a good coordination among the decision-makers can contribute to the improvement of the performance of combined non-pharmaceutical interventions, and it also benefits the short-term and long-term interventions in the future.","output":"Modeling indoor-level non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic: a pedestrian dynamics-based microscopic simulation approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To obtain timely and detailed data on COVID-19 cases in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses 2 data sources: (1) aggregate counts for daily situational awareness and (2) person-level data for each case (case surveillance). The objective of this study was to describe the sensitivity of case ascertainment and the completeness of person-level data received by CDC through national COVID-19 case surveillance. METHODS We compared case and death counts from case surveillance data with aggregate counts received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020. We analyzed case surveillance data to describe geographic and temporal trends in data completeness for selected variables, including demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and outcomes. RESULTS As of November 18, 2020, national COVID-19 case surveillance data received by CDC during April 5-September 30, 2020, included 4 990 629 cases and 141 935 deaths, representing 72.7% of the volume of cases (n = 6 863 251) and 71.8% of the volume of deaths (n = 197 756) in aggregate counts. Nationally, completeness in case surveillance records was highest for age (99.9%) and sex (98.8%). Data on race/ethnicity were complete for 56.9% of cases; completeness varied by region.

Results will be shared with Tribal communities to inform surveillance efforts. Methods: A Mixed Studies Review process was deemed most appropriate for the search process and data collection. Seven databases were included in the search along with 3 databases that were hand searched. Google Scholar and Google power searching were also conducted. Covidence was utilized for abstract and full-text review. Out of 1,512 articles, 75 articles were included for review and data from each article was sorted out into the levels of the social ecological model. Results: After extracting significant cancer related risk and protective factors from the 75 relevant articles, cancer related themes were identified at the individual, relationship (family and non-family), community, institutional, and cultural levels of the social ecological model. It was observed that the risk and protective factor profile for substance use spanned all levels of the social ecological model, whereas physical health-diet indicators and sexual health indicators did not.

Nasal/nasopharyngeal samples were tested in duplicate using antigen-based rapid influenza testing and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses. Monthly proportion positive was calculated for each virus. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify associations between sociodemographic/clinical information and viral detection. Of 571 subjects, most (470, 82.3%) were  5 years of age and 53.1% were male. A respiratory virus was detected by PCR in 63.6% (N = 363).

In this study, we tested a multiple shRNA expression strategy for different shRNAs using repeated promoters in a lentiviral vector. Although highly effective in co-transfection experiments, a markedly reduced activity of each expressed shRNA was observed in transduced cells. We found that this reduced activity was due to recombination of the expression cassette repeat sequences during the transduction of the lentiviral vector, which resulted in deletions of one or multiple cassettes. To avoid recombination, we tested different promoters for multiple shRNA expression. We compared the activity of the human polymerase III promoters U6, H1, and 7SK and the polymerase II U1 promoter. Activities of these promoters were similar, irrespective of which shRNA was expressed. We showed that these four expression cassettes can be combined in a single lentiviral vector without causing recombination.

Two hundred thirty-eight patients were infected; 33 died. Forty-two percent were health care workers. The whole medical system in the country was put under stress. One major public hospital became the designated SARS hospital. Emergency cases were diverted to the remaining public hospitals, of which Singapore General Hospital was the main recipient. The increase in workload, new infection control procedures including mandatory wearing of the positive airway pressure respirator and personal protective equipment (PPE), and limiting the number of person-contacts with each patient were thought to affect resuscitation and airway management. Our aim is to study the effects of wearing of PPE and the restriction in number of resuscitation personnel on airway management during the SARS crisis. Methods: The emergency department has an ongoing airway registry that prospectively captures patient demographics, diagnosis, indications for intubation, persons and discipline of intubating physician, number of attempts, method of intubation, success rates, and complications. The data were divided into 3 periods: (1) before PPE was instituted from November 1, 2002, to March 31, 2003; (2) during SARS (when PPE use was mandatory) from April 1 to July 31, 2003; and (3) after SARs (when PPE use was nonmandatory but encouraged) from August 1 to December 31, 2003. Results: There was no change in patient demographics during the 3 periods, but there was a change in the patient diagnoses in period 2, with decreases in the proportion of respiratory and cardiac cases and increases in neurology and trauma cases. These changes reverted to the previous distribution in period 3. The alarming discovery was that whereas in period 1 (pre-SARS), resident medical officers attempted intubations 45% of the time, this figure went down to 35% in period 2 (SARS) and 23% in period 3 (post-SARS). Anesthetists performed 1.2%, 8%, and 0% of emergency intubations in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Attending emergency physicians performed 54%, 56%, and 77% of intubations in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The complication/peri-intubation event rates were 10.5%, 9.9%, and 9.4% in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The success rate for residents was 80.8%, 89%, and 86.2% in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Conclusion: The wearing of PPE and positive airway pressure respirator is thought to make intubation more difficult, as seen by the increase in proportion of intubations performed by anesthetists in period 2 and by attending emergency physicians in periods 2 and 3. The infection control policy that restricts the number of health care staff attending to each patient may have influenced the department's decision to allow only the most confident or experienced personnel to manage the airway. The exposure of junior residents in emergency airway management during SARS and the immediate post-SARS period was decreased.

Against the backdrop of research on the HIV pandemic, the paper departs from the assumption that decreased legitimacy of intimate arrangements and subjective worry about the likeliness of infection may reduce the frequency of multiple sexual contact and intimate well-being during the pandemic. Based on findings from a quantitative study which included measures of risk perception, frequency of contact with sexual partners and communities, concealment, as well as relationship quality in Austria and Germany, this paper examines sexual behaviour in association with relationship status and sexual identity. Analysing data from a convenience sample of 4,709 respondents, of whom 24 per cent identified as LGBQA+, 2 per cent as non-binary, and 6 per cent as consensually non-monogamous, bivariate analysis found significant differences in social distancing, frequency of contact with sexual communities and satisfaction with current sex life. Text analysis of the survey's open-ended responses indicates monogamisation due to declined legitimacy of less conventional intimate arrangements during the pandemic. Findings point to the importance of the sexual morality that defined pandemic experiences in times of HIV for understanding normative pressure on intimate life during COVID-19.","output":"The grip of pandemic mononormativity in Austria and Germany."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic has brought to everybodys attention the apparent need of remote monitoring, highlighting hitherto unseen challenges in healthcare. Today, mobile monitoring and real-time data collection, processing and decision-making, can drastically improve the cardiorespiratoryChaemodynamic health diagnosis and care, not only in the rural communities, but urban ones with limited healthcare access as well. Disparities in socioeconomic status and geographic variances resulting in regional inequity in access to healthcare delivery, and significant differences in mortality rates between rural and urban communities have been a growing concern. Evolution of wireless devices and smartphones has initiated a new era in medicine. Mobile health technologies have a promising role in equitable delivery of personalized medicine and are becoming essential components in the delivery of healthcare to patients with limited access to in-hospital services. Yet, the utility of portable health monitoring devices has been suboptimal due to the lack of user-friendly and computationally efficient physiological data collection and analysis platforms. We present a comprehensive review of the current cardiac, pulmonary, and haemodynamic telemonitoring technologies.

No cohorts have examined the association between sRAGE and progressive decline of lung function. There have also been no evaluation of assay compatibility, receiver operating characteristics, and little examination of the effect of genetic variability in non-white population. This manuscript addresses these deficiencies and introduces novel data from Pittsburgh COPD SCCOR and as well as novel work on airflow obstruction. A meta-analysis is used to quantify sRAGE associations with clinical phenotypes. METHODS: sRAGE was measured in four independent longitudinal cohorts on different analytic assays: COPDGene (n = 1443); SPIROMICS (n = 1623); ECLIPSE (n = 2349); Pittsburgh COPD SCCOR (n = 399). We constructed adjusted linear mixed models to determine associations of sRAGE with baseline and follow up forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV(1)) and emphysema by quantitative high-resolution CT lung density at the 15th percentile (adjusted for total lung capacity). RESULTS: Lower plasma or serum sRAGE values were associated with a COPD diagnosis (P < 0.001), reduced FEV(1) (P < 0.001), and emphysema severity (P < 0.001). In an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, one SD lower log(10)-transformed sRAGE was associated with 105  22 mL lower FEV(1) and 4.14  0.55 g/L lower adjusted lung density. After adjusting for covariates, lower sRAGE at baseline was associated with greater FEV(1) decline and emphysema progression only in the ECLIPSE cohort. Non-Hispanic white subjects carrying the rs2070600 minor allele (A) and non-Hispanic African Americans carrying the rs2071288 minor allele (A) had lower sRAGE measurements compare to those with the major allele, but their emphysema-sRAGE regression slopes were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Lower blood sRAGE is associated with more severe airflow obstruction and emphysema, but associations with progression are inconsistent in the cohorts analyzed. In these cohorts, genotype influenced sRAGE measurements and strengthened variance modelling. Thus, genotype should be included in sRAGE evaluations.

The role of household transmission in the population spread of SARS-CoV-2, and of host immunity in limiting transmission, is poorly understood. This paper describes a protocol for a prospective observational study of a cohort of households in Liverpool City Region, UK, which addresses the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between household members and how immunological response to the infection changes over time. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Households in the Liverpool City Region, in which members have not previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a nucleic acid amplification test, are followed up for an initial period of 12 weeks. Participants are asked to provide weekly self-throat and nasal swabs and record their activity and presence of symptoms. Incidence of infection and household secondary attack rates of COVID-19 are measured. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will be investigated against a range of demographic and behavioural variables. Blood and faecal samples are collected at several time points to evaluate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevalence and risk factors for faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2, respectively.

However, forecasting during the pandemic remained challenging and sometimes highly controversial. Here, we highlight this challenge by performing a comparative evaluation for the estimations obtained from three COVID-19 surge calculators under different social distancing approaches, taking Lebanon as a case study. Despite discrepancies in estimations, the three surge calculators used herein agree that there will be a relative shortage in the capacity of medical resources and a significant surge in PPE demand as the social distancing policy is removed.

Currently, the USA, India, Brazil, and other parts of the world are experiencing a secondary wave of COVID-19. However, the medical, mathematical, and pharmaceutical aspects of its transmission, incubation, and recovery processes are still unclear. The classical susceptible-infected-recovered model has limitations in describing the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to introduce a recursive, latent model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infection cases in the USA. In this article, a dynamic recursive and latent infection model (RLIM) based on the classical SEIR model is proposed to predict the number of COVID-19 infections. Given COVID-19 infection and recovery data for a certain period, the RLIM is able to fit current values and produce an optimal set of parameters with a minimum error rate according to actual reported numbers. With these optimal parameters assigned, the RLIM model then becomes able to produce predictions of infection numbers within a certain period. To locate the turning point of COVID-19 transmission, an initial value for the secondary infection rate is given to the RLIM algorithm for calculation. RLIM will then calculate the secondary infection rates of a continuous time series with an iterative search strategy to speed up the convergence of the prediction outcomes and minimize the maximum square errors. Compared with other forecast algorithms, RLIM is able to adapt the COVID-19 infection curve faster and more accurately and, more importantly, provides a way to identify the turning point in virus transmission by searching for the equilibrium between recoveries and new infections. Simulations of four US states show that with the secondary infection rate &#969; initially set to 0.5 within the selected latent period of 14 days, RLIM is able to minimize this value at 0.07 and reach an equilibrium condition. A successful forecast is generated using New York state's COVID-19 transmission, in which a turning point is predicted to emerge on January 31, 2021.

CONCLUSIONS: Although initial investigation suggested the church service as source of the outbreak, detailed analysis showed a more complex picture, most consistent with widespread regional circulation of the virus in the weeks before the outbreak, and multiple introductions into the nursing home before the visitor ban. The findings underscore the importance of careful outbreak investigations to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission to develop evidence-based mitigation measures.","output":"Unravelling the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during a nursing home outbreak: looking beyond the church super-spread event"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world continues to confront COVID-19, every governing body, conference, and association, and virtually every collegiate institution, continues to carefully monitor, evaluate, and consider both the current situation and their next steps","output":"Rethink management, operation of sports in light of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to explore how women entrepreneurs in Brazil are managing their businesses and gendered role expectations at home in the context of Covid-19.

Literature in this area is sparse. The present study has been done to explore the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of doctors regarding this pandemic and how it influences their depression, anxiety, and stress level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This online survey has been done for 10 days. Data were collected on background characteristics, knowledge, attitude, and behavior of the respondents in a semi-structured pro forma, and psychiatric morbidity was measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. A total of 152 complete responses have been received. The data were assessed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Out of 152 study participants, 34.9% were depressed and 39.5% and 32.9% were having anxiety and stress, respectively. Significant predictors for psychiatric morbidities were experience in health sector, duty hours, use of protective measures, and altruistic coping. Multivariable logistic regression showed most of the factors to be significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress level. DISCUSSION: Doctors who were working during COVID pandemic have a high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity. Age and having multiple comorbidities are significant predictive factors. Adequate protective measures should be warranted. Altruistic coping and a sense of greater goal are significant among the doctor community, in this pressing time. The doctors are pushing themselves to the best of their capacity and also protecting their patients' best interest.

These measures comprised, among others, social distancing, the temporary closure of shops and schools, and a ban of large public gatherings and meetings with people not living in the same household. OBJECTIVE: It is fair to assume that the issued NPIs have heavily affected social life and psychological functioning. We therefore aimed to examine possible effects of this lockdown in conjunction with daily new infections and the state of the national economy on peoples interests, motives, and other psychological states. METHODS: We derived 249 keywords from the Google Trends database, tapping into 27 empirically and rationally selected psychological domains. To overcome issues with reliability and specificity of individual indicator variables, broad factors were derived by means of time series factor analysis. All domains were subjected to a change point analysis and time series regression analysis with infection rates, NPIs, and the state of the economy as predictors. All keywords and analyses were preregistered prior to analysis. RESULTS: With the pandemic arriving in Germany, significant increases in peoples search interests were observed in virtually all domains. Although most of the changes were short-lasting, each had a distinguishable onset during the lockdown period. Regression analysis of the Google Trends data confirmed pronounced autoregressive effects for the investigated variables, while forecasting by means of the tested predictors (ie, daily new infections, NPIs, and the state of economy) was moderate at best. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that peoples interests, motives, and psychological states are heavily affected in times of crisis and lockdown. Specifically, disease- and virus-related domains (eg, pandemic disease, symptoms) peaked early, whereas personal health strategies (eg, masks, homeschooling) peaked later during the lockdown. Domains addressing social life and psychosocial functioning showed long-term increases in public interest. Renovation was the only domain to show a decrease in search interest with the onset of the lockdown. As changes in search behavior are consistent over multiple domains, a Google Trends analysis may provide information for policy makers on how to adapt and develop intervention, information, and prevention strategies, especially when NPIs are in effect.","output":"Interests, Motives, and Psychological Burdens in Times of Crisis and Lockdown: Google Trends Analysis to Inform Policy Makers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces HeBERT and HebEMO. HeBERT is a Transformer-based model for modern Hebrew text, which relies on a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers) architecture. BERT has been shown to outperform alternative architectures in sentiment analysis, and is suggested to be particularly appropriate for MRLs. Analyzing multiple BERT specifications, we find that while model complexity correlates with high performance on language tasks that aim to understand terms in a sentence, a more-parsimonious model better captures the sentiment of entire sentence. Either way, out BERT-based language model outperforms all existing Hebrew alternatives on all common language tasks. HebEMO is a tool that uses HeBERT to detect polarity and extract emotions from Hebrew UGC. HebEMO is trained on a unique Covid-19-related UGC dataset that we collected and annotated for this study. Data collection and annotation followed an active learning procedure that aimed to maximize predictability. We show that HebEMO yields a high F1-score of 0.96 for polarity classification. Emotion detection reaches F1-scores of 0.78-0.97 for various target emotions, with the exception of surprise, which the model failed to capture (F1 = 0.41).

This paper introduces a novel two-phase approach for classifying chest X-ray images. Deep Learning (DL) methods fail to cover these aspects since training and fine-tuning the model's parameters consume much time. In this approach, the first phase comes to train a deep CNN working as a feature extractor, and the second phase comes to use Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) for real-time detection. The main drawback of ELMs is to meet the need of a large number of hidden-layer nodes to gain a reliable and accurate detector in applying image processing since the detective performance remarkably depends on the setting of initial weights and biases. Therefore, this paper uses Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA) to improve results and increase the reliability of the network while maintaining real-time capability. The designed detector is to be benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k and COVIDetectioNet datasets, and the results are verified by comparing it with the classic DCNN, Genetic Algorithm optimized ELM (GA-ELM), Cuckoo Search optimized ELM (CS-ELM), and Whale Optimization Algorithm optimized ELM (WOA-ELM). The proposed approach outperforms other comparative benchmarks with 98.25 % and 99.11 % as ultimate accuracy on the COVID-Xray-5k and COVIDetectioNet datasets, respectively, and it led relative error to reduce as the amount of 1.75 % and 1.01 % as compared to a convolutional CNN.

We provide a detailed transcriptome atlas for BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), an important human pathogen, and the prototype PyV, simian virus 40 (SV40). We identify pervasive wraparound transcription in PyV, wherein transcription runs through the polyA site and circles the genome multiple times. Comparative analyses identify novel, conserved transcripts that increase PyV coding capacity. One of these conserved transcripts encodes superT, a T antigen containing two RB-binding LxCxE motifs. We find that superT-encoding transcripts are abundant in PyV-associated human cancers.

METHODS: Population-based cross-sectional study of all accredited nursing homes in Victoria (n=766), accommodating 48,824 permanent residents. We examined each home's facility structure, governance history, socio-economic status, proximity to high-risk industry, and proximity and size of local acute public hospital, stratified by location, size and organizational structure. RESULTS: Privately owned nursing homes tend to be larger and metropolitan-based, and publicly owned homes regionally based and smaller in size. The details reveal additional nuance, e.g. privately owned metropolitan-based medium-to-large-sized facilities tended to have more regulatory non-compliance, no board of governance, and fewer Chief Executive Officers with clinical background. In contrast, the smaller, publicly owned, remote facilities perform better on those same metrics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients undergoing acute care surgery. The triage admission protocol was based on rapid antigen tests, Liat(?) PCR and RT-PCT tests. Type of surgical procedure, patient characteristics, and efficacy indices of the centralized quarantine unit and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed before (Phase I: May 11 to July 2, 2021) and after (Phase II: July 3 to July 31, 2021) the system started. RESULTS: A total of 287 patients (105 in Phase I and 182 in Phase II) were enrolled. Nosocomial COVID-19 infection occur in 27 patients in phase I but zero in phase II. More patients received traumatological, orthopedic, and neurologic surgeries in phase II than in phase I. The patients surgical risk classification, median total hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, intraoperative blood loss, operation time, and the number of patients requiring postoperative ICU care were similar in both groups. The duration of ED stay and waiting time for acute care surgery were longer in Phase II (397 vs. 532 minutes, p < 0.0001).

This barrier includes lack of readily available sleep medicine expert contact, health care insurance navigation challenges and difficulties with continuity of care. Chronic pervasive gaps in sleep medicine care were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. While numerous models were previously proposed to bridge SRBD care gaps, sustained and quantifiable success has been elusive. METHODS: Deploying interactive technology and artificial intelligence, we designed and implemented a novel, user-friendly integrated medium named Ognomy - the Sleep Apnea App, to mitigate widespread SRBD care access gaps. Multi-faceted but unified open access was made widely available, allowing bidirectional patient-provider interaction through a Web App. Individuals or surrogates who suspect that they or dependents suffer from SRBD are able to readily establish secure access to Ognomy. Patients can independently download and interact with the application on-demand and around the clock. RESULTS: From April 2020 to date, more than seven thousand (7,726) Ognomy App downloads have been documented. Over a thousand (1,169) patient registrations have occurred on Ognomy. Five hundred seventy-four (49.1%) of Ognomy App registrants have since been provided hitherto difficult, cumbersome access to full care, by a board-certified Sleep Medicine provider. Four hundred eighty-nine (85.2%) of the 574 patients managed via Ognomys care provision chain proceeded to complete sleep diagnostic testing and follow up. CONCLUSION: Availability of a readily accessible and affordable multi-faceted platform for care of sleep-related breathing disorders will mitigate the burden of untreated SRBD in the United Sates and worldwide. Ognomy, a Sleep as a Software service, is a novel integrated tool, bridging chronic gaps in sleep apnea care. Measures that significantly alter the trajectory of Sleep Medicine care now and in the future, have the potential to systematically close existing SRBD care gaps worldwide.

Interactive visualization methods allow for multiple related facets such as numerous risk factors to be studied simultaneously, leading to data insights through exploring trends and patterns from complex big health care data. The technique presents a powerful tool that can be used in combination with statistical analysis for knowledge discovery, hypothesis generation and testing, and decision support. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this scoping review is to describe and summarize the evidence of interactive visualization applications, methods, and tools being used in population health and health services research (HSR) and their subdomains in the last 15 years, from January 1, 2005, to March 30, 2019. Our secondary objective is to describe the use cases, metrics, frameworks used, settings, target audience, goals, and co-design of applications. METHODS: We adapted standard scoping review guidelines with a peer-reviewed search strategy: 2 independent researchers at each stage of screening and abstraction, with a third independent researcher to arbitrate conflicts and validate findings. A comprehensive abstraction platform was built to capture the data from diverse bodies of literature, primarily from the computer science and health care sectors. After screening 11,310 articles, we present findings from 56 applications from interrelated areas of population health and HSR, as well as their subdomains such as epidemiologic surveillance, health resource planning, access, and use and costs among diverse clinical and demographic populations. RESULTS: In this companion review to our earlier systematic synthesis of the literature on visual analytics applications, we present findings in 6 major themes of interactive visualization applications developed for 8 major problem categories. We found a wide application of interactive visualization methods, the major ones being epidemiologic surveillance for infectious disease, resource planning, health service monitoring and quality, and studying medication use patterns. The data sources included mostly secondary administrative and electronic medical record data. In addition, at least two-thirds of the applications involved participatory co-design approaches while introducing a distinct category, embedded research, within co-design initiatives. These applications were in response to an identified need for data-driven insights into knowledge generation and decision support. We further discuss the opportunities stemming from the use of interactive visualization methods in studying global health; inequities, including social determinants of health; and other related areas. We also allude to the challenges in the uptake of these methods.

Herein, we would like to briefly emphasize the importance and potential critical role of PERT in the care of patients in which these two devastating illnesses are present together.","output":"Impact and role of pulmonary embolism response teams in venous thromboembolism associated with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interactions between chemokine receptors and their ligands may affect susceptibility to infectious diseases as well as their clinical manifestations. These interactions mediate both the traffic of inflammatory cells and virus-associated immune responses. In the context of viral infections, the human C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) receives great attention from the scientific community due to its role as an HIV-1 co-receptor. The genetic variant CCR5&#916;32 (32 base-pair deletion in CCR5 gene) impairs CCR5 expression on the cell surface and is associated with protection against HIV infection in homozygous individuals. Also, the genetic variant CCR5&#916;32 modifies the CCR5-mediated inflammatory responses in various conditions, such as inflammatory and infectious diseases. CCR5 antagonists mimic, at least in part, the natural effects of the CCR5&#916;32 in humans, which explains the growing interest in the potential benefits of using CCR5 modulators for the treatment of different diseases. Nevertheless, beyond HIV infection, understanding the effects of the CCR5&#916;32 variant in multiple viral infections is essential to shed light on the potential effects of the CCR5 modulators from a broader perspective. In this context, this review discusses the involvement of CCR5 and the effects of the CCR5&#916;32 in human infections caused by the following pathogens: West Nile virus, Influenza virus, Human papillomavirus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Poliovirus, Dengue virus, Human cytomegalovirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Enterovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Hantavirus. Subsequently, this review addresses the impacts of CCR5 gene editing and CCR5 modulation on health and viral diseases.

The available technique to identify the phylogenetic clades through high-throughput sequencing is costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive that hinders the viral genotyping in low-income countries. Here, we propose a rapid, simple and cost-effective amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS)-based multiplex reverse-transcriptase PCR assay to identify six distinct phylogenetic clades: S, L, V, G, GH, and GR. This approach is applied on 24 COVID-19 positive samples as confirmed by CDC approved real-time PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. Our multiplex PCR is designed in a mutually exclusive way to identify V-S and G-GH-GR clade variants separately. The pentaplex assay included all five variants and the quadruplex comprised of the triplex variants alongside either V or S clade mutations that created two separate subsets. The procedure was optimized in the primer concentration (0.2-0.6 M) and annealing temperature (56-60{degrees}C) of PCR using 3-5 ng/l cDNA template synthesized upon random- and oligo(dT)-primer based reverse transcription. The different primer concentration for the triplex and quadruplex adjusted to different strengths ensured an even amplification with a maximum resolution of all targeted amplicons. The targeted Sanger sequencing further confirmed the presence of the clade-featured mutations with another set of our designed primers.

We describe these bacteria, highlighted by studies using metagenomic approaches. In addition, these bacteria generate metabolites such as butyrate, desaminotyrosine, and secondary bile acid, suggested to prevent viral respiratory infections. Gut microbial metabolites transported via the circulation to the lungs could inhibit viral replication or improve the immune response against viruses.

Findings In this decision analytical model, the use of risk-based, age-based, and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Cphased vaccine allocation strategies was simulated. Risk-based strategies were associated with the largest estimated reductions in nonelective hospitalizations, death, and household transmissions compared with the CDC- and age-based strategies, with a similar proportion of Hispanic and Black patients being vaccinated early in the process compared with the CDC strategy. Meaning The study findings suggest that risk-based vaccine prioritization strategies could have the greatest effectiveness on reducing COVID-19Crelated deaths and household transmissions while ensuring equitable vaccine distribution. Importance Identifying the most efficient COVID-19 vaccine allocation strategy may substantially reduce hospitalizations and save lives while ensuring an equitable vaccine distribution. Objective To simulate the association of different vaccine allocation strategies with COVID-19Cassociated morbidity and mortality and their distribution across racial and ethnic groups. Design, Setting, and Participants We developed and internally validated the risk of COVID-19 infection and risk of hospitalization models on randomly split training and validation data sets. These were used in a computer simulation study of vaccine prioritization among adult health plan members who were drawn from an integrated health care delivery system. The study was conducted from January 3, 2021, to June 1, 2021, in Oakland, California, and the data were analyzed during the same period. Main Outcomes and Measures We simulated the association of different vaccine allocation strategies, including (1) random, (2) a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proxy, (3) age based, and (4) combinations of models for the risk of adverse outcomes (CRS) and COVID-19 infection (PROVID), with COVID-19-related hospitalizations between May 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, that were randomly permuted by month across 250 simulations and assessed vaccine allocation by race and ethnicity and the neighborhood deprivation index across time. Results The study included 3 202 679 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 48.2 [18.0] years;1 677 637 women [52.4%];1 525 042 men [47.6%];611 154 Asian [19.1%], 206 363 Black [6.4%], 642 344 Hispanic [20.1%], and 1 390 638 White individuals [43.4%]), of whom 36 137 (1.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. A risk-based strategy (CRS/PROVID) showed the largest avoidable hospitalization estimates (4954;95% CI, 3452-5878) followed by age-based (4362;95% CI, 2866-5175) and CDC proxy (4085;95% CI, 2805-5109) strategies. Random vaccination showed substantially lower reductions in adverse outcomes. Risk-based strategies also showed the largest number of avoidable COVID-19 deaths (joint CRS/PROVID) and household transmissions. Risk-based (PROVID) and CDC proxy strategies were estimated to vaccinate the highest percentage of Hispanic and Black patients in 8 months (joint CRS/PROVID: 642 570 [100%] Hispanic, 185 530 [90%] Black;PROVID: 642 570 [100%] Hispanic, 198 480 [96%] Black;CDC proxy: 605 770 [95%] Hispanic and 151 772 [74%] Black) compared with an age-based approach (438 423 [68%] Hispanic, 154 714 [75%] Black).

Despite a wide range of advised options for the treatment of COVID-19, a single strategy to tackle this pandemic remains elusive, thus far. That is why we are conducting a clinical trial to find out the efficacy of iodine complex to clear a viral load of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) along with a reduction in time taken to alleviate symptoms. METHOD: The proposed study is a placebo-controlled, add-on, randomized trial using parallel group designs. This is a closed-label and adaptive with sample size reassessment, multi-centered design with a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio and superiority framework. It will be conducted in Shaikh Zayed Post-Graduate Medical Complex, Ali Clinic, and Doctors Lounge, Lahore, Pakistan. This study will have three arms of mild to moderately symptomatic COVID-19 patients (50 patients in each) which will receive ionic-iodine polymer complex with 200 mg of elemental iodine: interventional arm A will have encapsulated, arm B will receive suspension syrup form, arm C will get throat spray, while arm X will be standard care with placebo. Data will be collected on self-constructed, close-ended questionnaires after obtaining written consent. Data will be analyzed using SAS version 9.4. COVID-19 patients will be monitored by RT-PCR and HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) chest. In addition to these, the duration of the symptomatic phase and mortality benefits will be analyzed in both groups. DISCUSSION: The study is designed to measure the superior efficacy of the iodine complex as an add-on in treating COVID-19-positive patients with mild to moderate symptoms. This combination is hypothesized to improve various parameters like rapid viral load reduction, clinical and radiological improvement, lower mortality, and reduction in hospitalization. The trial will aid in devising a better strategy to cope with COVID-19 in a relatively inexpensive and accessible way. The implications are global, and this could prove itself to be the most manageable intervention against COVID-19 especially for patients from limited-resource countries with deprived socioeconomic status.

This work focuses on the spread of COVID-19 between June and November 2020 in Greater Buenos Aires. Within this period of time there was no vaccine, basically only the early wild strain of SARS-CoV-2 was present, and the official restriction and distancing measures in this region remained more or less constant.

Work ability is impacted by many rheumatic diseases, including the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), however, methods to assess the real-time impacts are limited. This study aims to explore the impact of IIM flares and symptoms upon employment using frequently collected data via a smartphone-based app. Methods The Myositis Physical Activity Device Study recruited a UK-based adult IIM cohort who completed weekly employment and flare questions via a specially designed smartphone-based app throughout a 91 day period in 2019/20. Employment-related questions were assessed every week (see Table 1 for details). Flares were reported via a weekly question. Employment variables were compared between flare and non-flare weeks using descriptive statistics. The relationship between flares and work productivity was assessed using multi-level mixed effects logistic regression modelling, adjusted for age and sex. Results Data on 13 (69% female) employed participants was analysed. A median of 5 flares were reported per patient during the three month period (IQR 3, 9). Summary employment results are displayed in Table 1. Participants reported greater impact of IIM upon employment, lower productivity and fewer hours worked during a flare week, compared to a non-flare week. There was a significant association between flares and detrimental impact upon work productivity (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 1.12, p < 0.01). Flares were also significantly associated with an increased number of work hours missed due to IIM (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01, 1.08, p = 0.02) Conclusion Our study has demonstrated that IIM flares are significantly associated with detrimental impact upon employment ability.

Healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) in particular are a leading cause of complications during hospitalisation. Contamination of the healthcare environment is recognised as a source of infectious disease yet the significance of porous surfaces including healthcare textiles as fomites is not well understood. It is currently assumed there is little infection risk from textiles due to a lack of direct epidemiological evidence. Decontamination of healthcare textiles is achieved with heat and/or detergents by commercial or in-house laundering with the exception of healthcare worker uniforms which are laundered domestically in some countries. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for rigorous infection control including effective decontamination of potential fomites in the healthcare environment. This article aims to review the evidence for the role of textiles in the transmission of infection, outline current procedures for laundering healthcare textiles and review studies evaluating the decontamination efficacy of domestic and industrial laundering. METHODOLOGY: Pubmed, Google Scholar and Web of Science were searched for publications pertaining to the survival and transmission of microorganisms on textiles with a particular focus on the healthcare environment. RESULTS: A number of studies indicate that microorganisms survive on textiles for extended periods of time and can transfer on to skin and other surfaces suggesting it is biologically plausible that HCAIs and other infectious diseases can be transmitted directly through contact with contaminated textiles. Accordingly, there are a number of case studies that link small outbreaks with inadequate laundering or infection control processes surrounding healthcare laundry. Studies have also demonstrated the survival of potential pathogens during laundering of healthcare textiles, which may increase the risk of infection supporting the data published on specific outbreak case studies. CONCLUSIONS: There are no large-scale epidemiological studies demonstrating a direct link between HCAIs and contaminated textiles yet evidence of outbreaks from published case studies should not be disregarded. Adequate microbial decontamination of linen and infection control procedures during laundering are required to minimise the risk of infection from healthcare textiles. Domestic laundering of healthcare worker uniforms is a particular concern due to the lack of control and monitoring of decontamination, offering a route for potential pathogens to enter the clinical environment. Industrial laundering of healthcare worker uniforms provides greater assurances of adequate decontamination compared to domestic laundering, due to the ability to monitor laundering parameters; this is of particular importance during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimise any risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","output":"The role of textiles as fomites in the healthcare environment: a review of the infection control risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the classical rough set has been extended in many ways.

The one step in the binary relation means that the ordered pair of the starting and end points of the step belongs to the relation. Faced with some complex data sets, the one step information may be not feasible. Motivated by the notion of bisimulation in computer science, three types of bisimulation-based generalized fuzzy variable precision rough set (BGFVPRS) models are constructed. Different from many existed rough set models which are based on binary relations, the BGFVPRS models can distinguish objects by excavating the multi-step information of underlying relations.

Ancient Greek medical theory held that such illnesses are transmitted by airborne pathogenic emanations containing particulate matter (miasmata). Notable Roman and medieval scholars such as Varro, Ibn al-Khatib and Fracastoro developed these ideas, combining them with early germ theory and the concept of contagion. A widely held but vaguely defined belief in toxic miasmatic mists as a dominant causative agent in disease propagation was overtaken by the science of 19th century microbiology and epidemiology, especially in the study of cholera, which was proven to be mainly transmitted by contaminated water. Airborne disease transmission came to be viewed as burdened by a dubious historical reputation and difficult to demonstrate convincingly. A breakthrough came with the classic mid-20th century work of Wells, Riley and Mills who proved how expiratory aerosols (their droplet nuclei) could transport still-infectious tuberculosis bacteria through ventilation systems. The topic of aerosol transmission of pathogenic respiratory diseases assumed a new dimension with the mid-late 20th century Great Acceleration of an increasingly hypermobile human population repeatedly infected by different strains of zoonotic viruses, and has taken centre stage this century in response to outbreaks of new respiratory infections that include coronaviruses. From a geoscience perspective, the consequences of pandemic-status diseases such as COVID-19, produced by viral pathogens utilising aerosols to infect a human population currently approaching 8 billion, are far-reaching and unprecedented. The obvious and sudden impacts on for example waste plastic production, water and air quality and atmospheric chemistry are accelerating human awareness of current environmental challenges. As such, the anthropause lockdown enforced by COVID-19 may come to be seen as a harbinger of change great enough to be preserved in the Anthropocene stratal record.","output":"Aerosol transmission of human pathogens: From miasmata to modern viral pandemics and their preservation potential in the Anthropocene record"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"EndothelialCmesenchymal transition (EndoMT), a cellular differentiation process in which endothelial cells (ECs) lose their properties and differentiate into mesenchymal cells, has been observed not only during development but also in various pathological states in adults, including cancer progression and organ/tissue fibrosis. Transforming growth factor- (TGF-), an inflammation-related cytokine, has been shown to play central roles in the induction of EndoMT. TGF- induces EndoMT by regulating the expression of various transcription factors, signaling molecules, and cellular components that confer ECs with mesenchymal characteristics. However, TGF- by itself is not necessarily sufficient to induce EndoMT to promote the progression of EndoMT-related diseases to a refractory extent. In addition to TGF-, additional activation by other inflammatory factors is often required to stabilize the progression of EndoMT. Since recent lines of evidence indicate that inflammatory signaling molecules act as enhancers of EndoMT, we summarize the roles of inflammatory factors in the induction of EndoMT and related diseases. We hope that this review will help to develop therapeutic strategies for EndoMT-related diseases by targeting inflammation-mediated EndoMT.","output":"Emerging roles of inflammation-mediated endothelialCmesenchymal transition in health and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In natural environments, populations of microorganisms rapidly colonise surfaces forming biofilms. These sessile communities comprise a variety of species which contribute to biofouling and microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), especially on metals. Species heterogeneity in natural systems confers higher tolerance to adverse conditions such as biocide treatment compared with single species laboratory simulations. Effective chemical treatments to combat recalcitrant biofilms are often dangerous to apply; both to operators and the environment, and face international embargoes. Today, there is a drive to exchange current toxic and environmentally hazardous biocides with less harmful compounds. One effective method of achieving this goal is to generate multi-functional compounds capable of tackling corrosion and biofilm formation simultaneously, thus reducing the number of compounds in dosing procedures. In a previous study, a novel corrosion inhibitor demonstrated biocidal effects against three marine isolates during the early stages of biofilm formation. The compound; CTA-4OHcinn, holds great promise as a multi-functional inhibitor, however its effect on complex, multi-species biofilms remains unknown. Here we evaluate CTA-4OHcinn biocidal capacity against multi-species biofilms developed from oilfield samples. Mature biofilms were developed and treated with 10 mM CTA-4OHcinn for 4 h. The effects of the compound were assessed using mean probable number (MPN), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Results demonstrate that CTA-4OHcinn significantly reduces the viability of mature biofilms, supporting previous demonstrations on the secondary function of CTA-4OHcinn as a biocide. CLSM results further indicate that CTA-4OHcinn targets the cell membrane resulting in lysis. This finding complements the established corrosion inhibition function of CTA-4OHcinn, indicating the compound is a true multi-functional organic corrosion inhibitor.","output":"Efficiency of a Novel Multifunctional Corrosion Inhibitor Against Biofilms Developed on Carbon Steel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the impact of internationalization on the capital structure of firms in emerging markets before and after the financial crisis of 2008, with evidence from five countries in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru) We find that before the financial crisis, Latin American MNCs are characterized by lower debt levels than purely domestic firms However, after the financial crisis, we find that the MNCs are characterized by higher debt levels This finding suggests that after the financial crisis, the Latin American MNCs (like many firms) may be taking advantage of their access to low interest rates in the global capital markets","output":"Internationalization and the capital structure of firms in emerging markets: Evidence from Latin America before and after the financial crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of entire nations all over the world. In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person. Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet).

This study investigated whether delayed hepatic resection for CRLM affects long-term survival. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing hepatic resection for CRLM in a single centre (1987-2007) were grouped according to the timing of hepatectomy relative to index bowel surgery: less than 12 months (synchronous; group 1), 12-36 months (group 2) and more than 36 months (group 3).

DNA samples from the study populations were genotyped for 34 functional polymorphisms from 14 distinct candidate genes, which encode proteins related to viral cell entry, regulation of viral replication, innate immune modulators, regulatory cytokines, and effector cytokines. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Three core hospitals providing different services for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 under administrative control. A total of 230 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 were recruited from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. MAIN RESULTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Among the 14 genes, we found rs1131454 in OAS1 and rs1143627 in IL1B genes as independent genetic factors associated with disease severity (adjusted odds ratio = 7.1 and 4.6 in the dominant model, respectively). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of multiple phase pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 with unbiased multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis and identified a four-gene model with rs1131454 (OAS1), rs1143627 (IL1B), rs2074192 (ACE2), and rs11003125 (MBL). By combining these polygenetic factors with polyclinical factors, including age, sex, higher body mass index, and the presence of diabetes and hypertension, we proposed a composite risk model with a high area under the curve, sensitivity, and probability (0.917, 96.4%, and 74.3%, respectively) in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We successfully identified significant genetic factors in OAS1 and IL1B genes using a candidate gene approach study as valuable information for further mechanistic investigation and predictive model building.","output":"Identification of Aggravation-Predicting Gene Polymorphisms in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Using a Candidate Gene Approach Associated With Multiple Phase Pathogenesis: A Study in a Japanese City of 1 Million People"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A cytokine storm is an uncontrolled, excessive immune response that contributes to the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The neural circuitries involved in such function complete their maturation during early postnatal periods, when the brain is highly plastic and profoundly influenced by the environment. This phenomenon is considered as an evolutionary strategy, whereby metabolic functions are adjusted to environmental cues, such as food availability and maternal care. In this timeframe, adverse stimuli may program the body metabolism to maximize energy storage abilities to cope with hostile conditions. Consistently, the prevalence of obesity is higher among individuals who experienced early life stress (ELS). Oxytocin, a hypothalamic neurohormone, regulates the energy balance and modulates social, emotional, and eating behaviors, exerting both central and peripheral actions. Oxytocin closely cooperates with leptin in regulating energy homeostasis. Both oxytocin and leptin impact the neurodevelopment during critical periods and are affected by ELS and obesity. In this review article, we report evidence from the literature describing the effect of postnatal ELS (specifically, disorganized/inconstant maternal care) on the vulnerability to obesity with a focus on the role of oxytocin. We emphasize the existing research gaps and highlight promising directions worthy of exploration. Based on the available data, alterations in the oxytocin system may in part mediate the ELS-induced susceptibility to obesity.","output":"Early Life Stress, Brain Development, and Obesity Risk: Is Oxytocin the Missing Link?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article introduces South Korea's proactive approach in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic from the mental health perspective at various levels, including national-level policies, medical systems, infrastructures, and mental health professionals, as well as establishing connections and support for citizens.

Previously, we introduced two circadian hormones for trace deposition timing and recently demonstrated that messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers significantly improve time prediction accuracy. Here, we investigate the suitability of metabolites measured using a targeted metabolomics approach, for trace deposition timing. Analysis of 171 plasma metabolites collected around the clock at 2-h intervals for 36 h from 12 male participants under controlled laboratory conditions identified 56 metabolites showing statistically significant oscillations, with peak times falling into three day/night time categories: morning/noon, afternoon/evening and night/early morning. Time prediction modelling identified 10 independently contributing metabolite biomarkers, which together achieved prediction accuracies expressed as AUC of 0.81, 0.86 and 0.90 for these three time categories respectively. Combining metabolites with previously established hormone and mRNA biomarkers in time prediction modelling resulted in an improved prediction accuracy reaching AUCs of 0.85, 0.89 and 0.96 respectively. The additional impact of metabolite biomarkers, however, was rather minor as the previously established model with melatonin, cortisol and three mRNA biomarkers achieved AUC values of 0.88, 0.88 and 0.95 for the same three time categories respectively. Nevertheless, the selected metabolites could become practically useful in scenarios where RNA marker information is unavailable such as due to RNA degradation.

There is a paucity of studies on weaning outcomes and mortality after tracheostomy in COVID-19 in Indian scenario. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center, observational study of severe COVID-19 patients who underwent elective tracheostomy (n = 65) during critical care in a tertiary care institute in Central India from May 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021. Data were collected from Medical records, ICU charts, and follow-up visits by patient. A primary objective was to study the clinical characteristics, tracheostomy complications, weaning outcomes, and mortality at 28 and 60 days of ICU admission. We categorized the cohort into two groups (deceased and survivor) and studied association of clinical parameters with 28-day mortality. Cox Proportional regression analysis was applied to calculate the hazard ratio among the predictors of mortality with p value <0.05 as significant. RESULTS: Elective tracheostomy was done in 69 of 436 (15.8%) patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 65 were included. Tracheostomy was percutaneous in 45/65 (69%) and surgical in 20/65 (31%) with timing from intubation as early in 41/65 and late in 24/65 with most common indication as weaning failure followed by anticipated prolonged ventilation. Tracheostomy complications were present in 29/65 (45%) patients with no difference in complication rates between timing and type of tracheostomy. Downsizing, decannulation, and weaning were successful in 22%, 32 (49%), and 35/65 (54%) patients after tracheostomy. The 28-day mortality was 30/65 (46%). The fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO(2)) requirement in survivors was lower (0.4C0.6, p = 0.015) with a higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (118C200, p = 0.033). Early tracheostomy within 7 days of intubation was not associated with weaning or survival benefit. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that tracheostomy should be delayed to after 7 days of intubation, especially till FiO(2) reduces to 0.5 with improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) for better outcomes and avoiding a wasted procedure (CTRI/2021/07/034768). STUDY HIGHLIGHTS: Tracheostomy is integral in care of COVID-19 patients needing prolonged ventilation. There is no difference in complications in early/late or percutaneous dilatational/surgical technique. We observed successful weaning post-tracheostomy in 54% patients. Mortality at 28 days was 46%. Early tracheostomy within 7 days of intubation did not improve weaning or survival. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Karna ST, Trivedi S, Singh P, Khurana A, Gouroumourty R, Dodda B, et al.

Like other pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 infection can elicit production of the type I interferon (IFN) cytokines by the innate immune response. A rapid and robust type I and III IFN response can curb viral replication and improve clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To effectively replicate in the host, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved mechanisms for evasion of this innate immune response, which could also modulate COVID-19 pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss studies that have reported the identification and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that inhibit type I IFNs. We focus especially on the mechanisms of nsp1 and ORF6, which are the two most potent and best studied SARS-CoV-2 type I IFN inhibitors. We also discuss naturally occurring mutations in these SARS-CoV-2 IFN antagonists and the impact of these mutations in vitro and on clinical presentation. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and evolve, researchers will have the opportunity to study natural mutations in IFN antagonists and assess their role in disease. Additional studies that look more closely at previously identified antagonists and newly arising mutants may inform future therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.","output":"All hands on deck: SARS-CoV-2 proteins that block early anti-viral interferon responses()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The endoplasmic reticulum is a critical organelle for normal cell function and homeostasis.

ER stress and the UPR have recently been linked to inflammation in a variety of human pathologies including autoimmune diseases, infection, neurodegenerative disease, and metabolic disorders. In the cell, ER stress and inflammatory signaling share extensive regulators and effectors in a broad spectrum of biological processes. In spite of different etiologies, the two signaling pathways were shown to form a vicious cycle in exacerbating cellular dysfunction and causing apoptosis in many cells and tissues.

In this regard, RABGAP1L overexpression is sufficient to disrupt endosomal function during IAV infection and restricts an early post-attachment, but pre-fusion, stage of IAV cell entry.

We therefore initiated a systematic review to establish whether patients are satisfied with tele-delivery of psychiatric care, and to identify the predictors of a positive experience with telepsychiatry. METHODS: A preliminary search was performed using five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO), with a date restriction between 2010-2020 to reflect advances in technology over the past decade. RESULTS: Preliminary data shows that patient views on telepsychiatric services are largely positive. Factors that arose in literature potentially affecting this include location, cost, privacy, digital literacy and technological issues including audio/video quality. CONCLUSION: Our study so far shows that patient views on telepsychiatry are generally positive.

PEDV was first detected in the U.S. in May 2013 and spread rapidly across the country. Some serological assays for PEDV have been previously described, but few were readily available in the U.S. Several U.S. laboratories quickly developed indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assays for the detection of antibodies to PEDV in swine serum, indicating prior exposure. However, the IFA has several disadvantages, including low throughput and relatively subjective interpretation. Different serologic test formats have advantages and disadvantages, depending on the questions being asked, so a full repertoire of tests is useful. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and validate multiple improved serological assays for PEDV, including an indirect ELISA (iELISA); a highly specific monoclonal antibody-based blocking ELISA (bELISA); fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIA) that can be multiplexed to monitor exposure to multiple antigens and pathogens simultaneously; and a fluorescent focus neutralization assay (FFN) to measure functional virus neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: A recombinant North American nucleoprotein (NP) based iELISA was developed and validated along with a bELISA using newly developed PEDV-NP specific biotinylated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and an FMIA using magnetic beads coupled with expressed NA PEDV-NP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed using swine serum samples (iELISA n = 1486, bELISA n = 1186, FMIA n = 1420). The ROC analysis for the FMIA showed estimated sensitivity and specificity of 98.2 and 99.2 %, respectively. The iELISA and bELISA showed a sensitivity and specificity of 97.9 and 97.6 %; and 98.2 and 98.9 %, respectively. Inter-rater (kappa) agreement was calculated to be 0.941 between iELISA and IFA, 0.945 between bELISA and IFA and 0.932 between FMIA and IFA. Similar comparative kappa values were observed between the iELISA, bELISA and FMIA, which demonstrated a significant level of testing agreement among the three assays. No cross-reactivity with the closely related coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was noted with these assays. All three assays detected seroconversion of na?ve animals within 6C9 days post exposure. The FFN assay allows relative quantitation of functional neutralizing antibodies in serum, milk or colostrum samples. CONCLUSION: Well-validated iELISA, bELISA and FMIA assays for the detection of PEDV antibodies were developed and showed good correlation with IFA and each other. Each assay format has advantages that dictate how they will be used in the field. Newly developed mAbs to the PEDV-NP were used in the bELISA and for expediting FFN testing in the detection and quantitation of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, these PEDV mAbs are useful for immunohistochemistry, fluorescent antibody staining and other antigen-based tests. Measurement of neutralizing antibody responses using the FFN assay may provide a valuable tool for assessment of vaccine candidates or protective immunity.","output":"Development of an indirect ELISA, blocking ELISA, fluorescent microsphere immunoassay and fluorescent focus neutralization assay for serologic evaluation of exposure to North American strains of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study intended to observe mental symptoms among physicians in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the factors leading to such symptoms.

In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.","output":"Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne arthrogenic alphavirus that causes acute febrile illness in humans accompanied by joint pains and in many cases, persistent arthralgia lasting weeks to years. The re-emergence of CHIKV has resulted in numerous outbreaks in the eastern hemisphere, and threatens to expand in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, no effective treatment is currently available. The present study reports the use of resazurin in a cell-based high-throughput assay, and an image-based high-content assay to identify and characterize inhibitors of CHIKV-infection in vitro. CHIKV is a highly cytopathic virus that rapidly kills infected cells. Thus, cell viability of HuH-7 cells infected with CHIKV in the presence of compounds was determined by measuring metabolic reduction of resazurin to identify inhibitors of CHIKV-associated cell death. A kinase inhibitor library of 4,000 compounds was screened against CHIKV infection of HuH-7 cells using the resazurin reduction assay, and the cell toxicity was also measured in non-infected cells. Seventy-two compounds showing 50% inhibition property against CHIKV at 10 M were selected as primary hits. Four compounds having a benzofuran core scaffold (CND0335, CND0364, CND0366 and CND0415), one pyrrolopyridine (CND0545) and one thiazol-carboxamide (CND3514) inhibited CHIKV-associated cell death in a dose-dependent manner, with EC(50) values between 2.2 M and 7.1 M. Based on image analysis, these 6 hit compounds did not inhibit CHIKV replication in the host cell. However, CHIKV-infected cells manifested less prominent apoptotic blebs typical of CHIKV cytopathic effect compared with the control infection. Moreover, treatment with these compounds reduced viral titers in the medium of CHIKV-infected cells by up to 100-fold. In conclusion, this cell-based high-throughput screening assay using resazurin, combined with the image-based high content assay approach identified compounds against CHIKV having a novel antiviral activity - inhibition of virus-induced CPE - likely by targeting kinases involved in apoptosis.","output":"Identification of Novel Compounds Inhibiting Chikungunya Virus-Induced Cell Death by High Throughput Screening of a Kinase Inhibitor Library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support (CDS) tools built using adult data do not typically perform well for children. We explored how best to leverage adult data to improve the performance of such tools. This study assesses whether it is better to build CDS tools for children using data from children alone or to use combined data from both adults and children. METHODS: Retrospective cohort using data from 2017 to 2020. Participants include all individuals (adults and children) receiving an elective surgery at a large academic medical center that provides adult and pediatric services. We predicted need for mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Predictor variables included demographic, clinical, and service utilization factors known prior to surgery. We compared predictive models built using machine learning to regression-based methods that used a pediatric or combined adult-pediatric cohort. We compared model performance based on Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic. RESULTS: While we found that adults and children have different risk factors, machine learning methods are able to appropriately model the underlying heterogeneity of each population and produce equally accurate predictive models whether using data only from pediatric patients or combined data from both children and adults. Results from regression-based methods were improved by the use of pediatric-specific data.

The responsibilities of women, particularly mothers, are amplified during times of pressure. This study investigated the experiences of teaching-mothers in Pakistan during the Covid-19 pandemic to understand the challenges they faced as professionals and as mothers. The data were collected through in-depth interviews of 24 teaching-mothers. The study participants were identified through the snowball sampling technique. The data were collected until the point of data saturation and analysed through. The analysis indicates that teaching-mothers in Pakistan faced issues in terms of maintaining their work-life balance, managing space and resources for online teaching, and learning a new set of skills in order to teach online. These multiple challenges affected their mental health. The findings indicate a sharp division of gendered roles in Pakistan and their negative impact on the mental health of women during Covid-19.

Lockdown measures have provoked a disruption of daily life with a great impact over older adults' health and well-being. Nevertheless, eudaimonic well-being plays a protective role in confronting adverse circumstances, such as the COVID-19 situation. This study aims to assess the association between age and psychological well-being (personal growth and purpose in life). Young-old (60-70 years) and old-old (71-80 years) community-dwelling Spaniards (N = 878) completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics and their levels of health, COVID-19 stress-related, appraisal, and personal resources. Old-old did not evidence poorer psychological well-being than young-old. Age has only a negative impact on personal growth. The results also suggest that the nature of the COVID-19 impact (except for the loss of a loved one) may not be as relevant for the older adults' well-being as their appraisals and personal resources for managing COVID-related problems. In addition, these results suggest that some sociodemographic and health-related variables have an impact on older adults' well-being. Thus, perceived-health, family functioning, resilience, gratitude, and acceptance had significant associations with both personal growth and purpose in life.

To study the clinical, biochemical characteristics, treatment results and follow-up of patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome EAS (ACTH adrenocorticotropic hormone). Materials and methods. A retrospective, observational, single -center study of 130 patients with EAS. Demographic information of patients, medical history, results of laboratory and instrumental investigations at the pre- and postoperative stages and follow-up of EAS were analyzed. Results. The mean age at the diagnosis ranged from 12 to 74 years (Me 40 years [28;54]). The duration of the disease from the onset of symptoms to the verification of the diagnosis varied from 2 to 168 months (Me 17.5 months [7;46]). Eighty-one (62,3%) patients had bronchopulmonary NET, 9 thymic carcinoid, 7 pancreatic NET, 5 pheochromocytoma, 1 cecum NET, 1 appendix carcinoid tumor, 1 medullary thyroid cancer and 25 (19.2%) had an occult source of ACTH. The median follow-up period of patients was 27 months [9.75;61.0] with a maximum follow-up of 372 months. Currently, primary tumor was removed in 82 (63.1 %) patients, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed in 23 (18%) patients, in 16 of them there was an occult source of ACTH -producing NET and in 7 patients in order to control hypercortisolism after non successful surgical treatment.

PURPOSE The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of peripheral vasopressor administration in an attempt to minimize the placement and improve early removal of unnecessary central lines to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients who received vasopressors via peripheral infusion over 3 months, starting at the time of guideline implementation. RESULTS We identified 129 vasopressor orders among 79 patients that were administered peripherally. Among these orders, 3 events were documented as possible extravasation events. Forty-five patients (57%) did not require central line placement due to increasing vasopressor requirements. Standard utilization ratio data suggest minimal central line impact of the protocol implementation. December 2020 to February 2021 was associated with a large second peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in our region. Utilization of central lines was less than predicted in December 2020 to February 2021 in 2 of our 3 intensive care units (ICUs); however, the differences were statistically significant on only 3 occasions. In the third ICU, utilization was greater than predicted, but this unit housed a majority of the most critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Despite numerous guidelines promoting a bio-psycho-social (BPS) approach in the management of patients with LBP, many health care professionals (HCPs) still manage LBP patients mainly from a biomedical point of view. Objective: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing an interactive e-learning module on the management of LBP in HCPs. Methods: In total 22 HCPs evaluated the feasibility of the e-learning module with a questionnaire and open questions. Participants filled in the Back Pain Attitude Questionnaire (Back-PAQ) before and after completing the module to evaluate their attitudes and beliefs about LBP. Results: The module was structured and easy to complete (91%) and met the expectations of the participants (86%). A majority agreed that the module improved their knowledge (69%). Some participants (77%) identified specific topics that might be discussed in more detail in the module. HCPs knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about LBP significantly improved following module completion (t = -7.63, P < .001) with a very large effect size (ds = -1.63). Conclusion: The module seems promising to change knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of the participants.

In particular, it was thought that neurons were protected from direct attack by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) because they do not express major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules, at least at steady state. To date, most of our current knowledge on the specifics of neuron-CTL interaction is based on studies artificially inducing MHC I expression on neurons, loading them with exogenous peptide and applying CTL clones or lines often differentiated in culture. Thus, much remains to be uncovered regarding the modalities of the interaction between infected neurons and antiviral CD8 T cells in the course of a natural disease. Here, we used the model of neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic Borna disease virus (BDV), in which virus-specific CTL have been demonstrated as the main immune effectors triggering disease. We tested the pathogenic properties of brain-isolated CD8 T cells against pure neuronal cultures infected with BDV. We observed that BDV infection of cortical neurons triggered a significant up regulation of MHC I molecules, rendering them susceptible to recognition by antiviral CTL, freshly isolated from the brains of acutely infected rats. Using real-time imaging, we analyzed the spatio-temporal relationships between neurons and CTL. Brain-isolated CTL exhibited a reduced mobility and established stable contacts with BDV-infected neurons, in an antigen- and MHC-dependent manner. This interaction induced rapid morphological changes of the neurons, without immediate killing or impairment of electrical activity. Early signs of neuronal apoptosis were detected only hours after this initial contact. Thus, our results show that infected neurons can be recognized efficiently by brain-isolated antiviral CD8 T cells and uncover the unusual modalities of CTL-induced neuronal damage.","output":"Neurons are MHC Class I-Dependent Targets for CD8 T Cells upon Neurotropic Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urban development is often confronted with a lack of available space. Brownfield sites offer great potential for sustainable urban planning because of their often-central location and the benefits associated with their redevelopment. Although the interest in brownfield regeneration has led to a lot of research on this topic, there is not yet a comprehensive review of brownfield research. In this review, we analyze the research on brownfields and provide a picture of the published case studies. We focus primarily on brownfields research in the United States, Europe, and Peoples Republic of China. This exploratory research is based on an analysis of the published scientific literature available in the Web of Science database. Initially used in North America, the term brownfield quickly became popular in the rest of the world, particularly in Europe. However, with the exception of the United States, there is no specific legislation for these sites;their protection is often based indirectly on directives or laws related to soil pollution, biodiversity, or the environment. The perception of the potential use of brownfield sites varies considerably from one part of the world to another, and international collaborations among researchers from different parts of the world remain limited. Most of the described reuses of brownfield sites are forms of soft reuse (53%), and the type of reuse of a site depends more on the surrounding urbanization levels and the specific region than on the past use of a brownfield site. Despite the continued interest in the rehabilitation of these sites, especially due to the increasing demand for nature in the city following the COVID-19 crisis, many questions regarding the future of brownfield sites remain unanswered. The factors influencing their successful redevelopment are unclear, and further research is urgently needed to ensure a truly sustainable re-use of these sites. ? 2021 The Author(s).","output":"Brownfields over the years: from definition to sustainable reuse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A perplexing clinical aspect of COVID-19 is presentation of patients with pronounced hypoxemia without expected signs of respiratory distress or dyspnea, even when cyanotic.

STUDY DESIGN: The supernatant of these CPE positive cell cultures were grouped in 32 pools containing 2C26 supernatants per pool. Three WG-NGS runs were performed on these supernatant pools. Sequence reads were used to identify positive pools containing viral pathogens. Individual samples in the positive pools were confirmed by qRT-PCR, RT-PCR, PCR and Sanger sequencing from the CPE culture and original clinical specimens. RESULTS: WG-NGS was an effective way to expand pathogen identification in surveillance studies. This enabled the identification of a viral agent in 71.3% (231/324) of unidentified surveillance samples, including common respiratory pathogens (100/324; 30.9%): enterovirus (16/100; 16.0%), coxsackievirus (31/100; 31.0%), echovirus (22/100; 22.0%), human rhinovirus (3/100; 3%), enterovirus genus (2/100; 2.0%), influenza A (9/100; 9.0%), influenza B, (5/100; 5.0%), human parainfluenza (4/100; 4.0%), human adenovirus (3/100; 3.0%), human coronavirus (1/100; 1.0%), human metapneumovirus (2/100; 2.0%), and mumps virus (2/100; 2.0%), in addition to the non-respiratory pathogen herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (172/324; 53.1%) and HSV-1 co-infection with respiratory viruses (41/324; 12.7%).","output":"Retrospective use of next-generation sequencing reveals the presence of Enteroviruses in acute influenza-like illness respiratory samples collected in South/South-East Asia during 2010C2013"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, the Italian government adopted strict rules of lockdown and social distancing. The aim of our study was to assess admission rate for syncope leading to cardiac rhythm management (CRM) procedures in Campania, the third-most-populous region of Italy, during COVID-19 lockdown. Methods Data were sourced from 14 referral hospitals in Campania from 10th March to 4th May 2020 (lockdown period) and during the same period in 2019. Among consecutive patients hospitalized for CRM procedures during the two observational periods, we retrospectively evaluated those admitted for arrhythmogenic syncope. Admission rate and the type of hospital admission between the two observational periods were compared. Results Among 951 consecutive patients hospitalized for CRM procedures, 204 were admitted for arrhythmogenic syncope leading to CRM procedures. A significant increase in admission was shown in 2020 compared to 2019 (26.4% vs. 18.3%; P=0.003). Moreover, regarding the type of admission to hospitals, attendance at the emergency department (ED) significantly increased (83.5% vs. 56.1%; P<0.001); conversely, a significant decrease in urgent unplanned hospitalizations (6.2% vs. 35.5%; P<0.001) was observed during COVID-19 lockdown.

Patients and Methods We deployed the baseline questionnaire of a prospective online survey from November 20, 2020-February 8, 2021 to U.S.-based employees. The survey included questions on psychosocial and behavioral responses in addition to transmission prevention behaviors (e.g., mask wear). Select questions asked employees to report perceptions and behaviors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed descriptively and stratified by work from home (WFH) percentage. Results In total, 3,607 employees completed the survey from eight companies. Most participants (70.0%) averaged 90% of their time WFH during the pandemic. Employees reported increases in stress (54.0%), anxiety (57.4%), fatigue (51.6%), and feeling unsafe (50.4%) from before to during the pandemic, while feeling a lack of companionship (60.5%) and isolation from others (69.3%). Productivity was perceived to decrease, and non-work screen time and alcohol consumption to increase, for 43.0%, 50.7%, and 25.1% of employees, respectively, from before to during the pandemic. Adverse changes were worse among those with lower WFH percentages. Most employees reported wearing a mask (98.2%), washing hands regularly (95.7%), and physically distancing (93.6%) when at workplace.

For situations where a detention under mental health legislation is required to keep an individual safe, psychiatrists may consider whether to conduct an assessment in person or using video technology. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not stipulate that an assessment has to be conducted in person. Yet, the Code of Practice envisions that detention assessments would be conducted face to face in all circumstances. During the pandemic, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, a statutory body with a duty to promote best practice of the Act, has been asked whether it may be acceptable and indeed preferable for some assessments to be conducted via video technology. Where an assessment is needed to determine if a patient needs to be detained, and where there is a need for social distancing or the need for shielding, remote assessments may in some circumstances be preferable. In this article, we outline the modification of the Mental Welfare Commissions previous outright rejection of virtual assessments as the pandemic progressed and discuss the ethical and legal issues the possibility of remote assessments has exposed. We also discuss the limits and when a virtual assessment is not considered ethical. As the pandemic moves from a state of emergency into a new normal in psychiatric services during second, or subsequent, waves, the use and place (if any) of remote assessments for detention needs to be considered.","output":"Limits of remote working: the ethical challenges in conducting Mental Health Act assessments during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypertension has been identified as the most prevalent chronic disease, accounting for the majority of premature deaths in people with physical disability in South Korea.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate urological patient satisfaction with teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, prospective, cross-sectional, non-interventional study carried out by telephone survey during the period considered as the peak of the pandemic (March-April 2020). A quality survey composed of 11 questions on urological care provided by physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted, selecting a representative sample of patients attended by teleconsultation. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were contacted by telephone to answer a survey on the quality of teleconsultation. The distribution of patients surveyed among the specialized consultations was homogeneous with the number of consultations cited in the period; 18% of them required assistance from family members. Sixty percent of patients avoided going to a medical center during the pandemic. Of the surveyed patients, 42% had cancelled diagnostic tests, 59% had cancelled medical consultations, 3.5% had cancelled treatments and 1% had cancelled interventions. Ten percent reported a worsening of urological symptoms during confinement. According to physicians, consultations were effectively delivered in 72% of cases, with teleconsultation being carried out by their usual urologist in 81%. Teleconsultation overall satisfaction level was 9 (IQI8-10), and 61.5% of respondents consider teleconsultation as a ?health care option? after the healthcare crisis. CONCLUSION: Teleconsultation has been evaluated with a high level of satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering continuous care to urological patients during the healthcare crisis.

Some common 3D printed porous structures are strut based (e.g. octet truss), triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) (e.g. gyroid) or randomized (e.g. stochastic). When designed to be on the surface of bone interfacing implants, the surface porous region impacts short-term adhesion and friction, ultimately affecting implant stability prior to and during long-term osseointegration. In many orthopedic procedures, expulsion resistance is an essential design requirement, to prevent the risk of the implant migrating from the implantation site. While expulsion tests are universal, they are a poorly understood method to examine the bone-implant interface in determining the performance of an orthopedic implant. In this foundational study, we examine the expulsion behavior of metallic samples in synthetic Sawbone with systematically varied surface topography at increasing applied normal forces. The applied normal force and size of the sample were shown to have the strongest influence on expulsion force followed by surface structure. Compared to a polished sample control, certain 3D printed surface structures are up to 10x more expulsion resistant and should be considered in implants where prevention of implant migration before and during osseointegration is critical. Nonlinear relationships were discovered that reveal \\"crossover\\" in expulsion resistance as a function of applied load revealing that the ranking of the relative expulsion resistance of different samples can depend on the normal force selected.

In ECT/RFA, however, the direct current circuit was switched off after 10 min of pretreatment and only RFA was performed as described above. Ablation sizes were measured in three dimensions. RESULTS The size of ablations (transverse diameter A and B) produced by BETA and ECT/RFA was significantly larger compared with standard RFA (P < 0/001). BETA also created larger ablations compared with ECT/RFA (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION BETA could improve the efficacy of the Cool-Tip RF system (Covidien) to achieve larger ablations. The increased tissue hydration improved delivery of electrical energy to the tissues and delayed the process of desiccation, thus allowing the ablation process to continue for longer periods of time to produce larger ablations. BETA could be used to treat larger liver tumours more effectively than standard RFA.","output":"Bimodal electric tissue ablation (BETA) compared with the Cool-Tip RFA system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As outbreak of COVID-19 infection, on April 3, 2020, it is stipulated that the number of inpatient companions is limited to one in Taiwan. All companions are required to register their real personal data with 14 days of travel history, occupation, contact history, and cluster history. We would like to evaluate the impact of the new regulations to the accompanying and visiting culture in Taiwan, via analyzing the appearance and characteristics of inpatient companions in this period. METHODS: Using intelligent technology, we designed a novel system in managing the inpatient companions (InPatients Companions Management System [IPCMS]), and the IPCMS was used to collect data about characteristics of inpatients and companions between April 27 and May 3, 2020. The database is built using MySQL software. Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS version 20.0 statistical software were used for data analysis, including the basic data of the companions, differential analysis of companions' gender, person-days and cumulative time, differential analysis of accompaniment-patient relationship, and frequency of accompaniment and cumulative hours. RESULTS: During study period, daily inpatient admissions ranged from 2242 to 2514, the number of companions per day ranged from 2048 to 2293, and the number of companions for one inpatient is 1 to 9 per day, with an average of 1.20 to 1.26. The companions were mostly family members, and most of them were the inpatients' children (32.9%), and spouse (26.13%). More females than males were noted in all categories of companionship with statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The data obtained in this study could be an important basis for the transformation and reform of the companions culture in Taiwan's hospitals and will also provide a glimpse into the attitudes and culture of companions who have long been ignorant and neglected. The experience gained in our IPCMS could also serve as a reference for other hospitals in Taiwan and worldwide.","output":"Visiting in disguise: Analysis of inpatient companions in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid development and deployment of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 have been a key component of the public health response to the pandemic Out of necessity, academic and other clinical laboratories developed laboratory testing innovations for COVID-19 to meet clinical testing demands In addition to constraints on local testing supplies and equipment, a rapidly changing regulatory framework created challenges for translational scientists Illustrative examples of approaches used to develop laboratory tests during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate effective team science approaches to this challenging clinical care and public health emergency These experiences and the associated lessons learned are relevant to the development of public health response plans for future pandemics","output":"Modifying laboratory testing via home brew during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The WHO has highlighted the technical challenges of assessing immunity status, cautioning against immunity passports.

A novel method-colonoscopy-assisted transanal minimally invasive surgery via glove port (CA-TAMIS-GP)-for resecting early rectal tumor was developed and compared with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed CA-TAMIS-GP surgery on 26 patients from January 2014 to February 2016. For better analysis, we retrospectively collected data from 31 patients who underwent ESD between October 2012 and December 2013; overall, 57 patients diagnosed with early rectal tumor were included in this study. Perioperative conditions and long-term outcomes of both groups were compared. RESULTS All lesions were dissected completely and successfully without conversion to open surgery or major complications. On histopathologic examination, all specimens in this study had negative margins. All patients had uneventful postoperative recoveries, except 3 patients of CA-TAMIS-GP with minor hematochezia, which resolved spontaneously; 7 ESD patients had late-onset bleeding and 3 needed colonoscopic hemostasis; 2 patients in each group had mild fever. The CA-TAMIS-GP group had a shorter operation time, less hemorrhage, and a lower average consumable cost than the ESD group (P < 0.05); moreover, the CA-TAMIS-GP group had no recurrence or long-term complications during a follow-up of 10-32 months, whereas3 patients in the ESD group developed local recurrence during a follow-up of 24-36 months.

Effective and rapid diagnosis of AMI is essential to following treatment in clinical practice while the existed biomarkers have inherent limitations. Consequently, exploration of novel biomarkers is needed. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) emerges as the upcoming biomarkers adopted in clinical use, and we aim at investigating the diagnostic power of lncRNA TTTY15 and HULC in AMI patients. METHOD: We measured lncRNA level in 80 AMI patients and 36 healthy volunteers in discovering cohort and 50 AMI patients and 20 healthy volunteers in verification cohort with quantitative RT-PCR method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was administered to detect the diagnostic power of selected lncRNAs. Regression and correlation analyses were performed to explore the related factors. RESULTS: ROC analysis reveals the superiority of TTTY15 and HULC as biomarkers against conventional AMI biomarkers CKMB (AUC of TTTY15: 0.915 versus CKMB: 0.768 versus TnT: 0.869); AUC of HULC: 0.905 versus CKMB: 0.768 versus TnT: 0.869). Regression and correlation analysis indicates that TTTY15 and HULC may be one of the contributing factors to AMI and related to accepted risk factors.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked widespread disruption to clinical nurses' work. It is important to understand clinical nurses' processes of coping during disasters to support the nursing workforce during events such as global pandemics. DESIGN: We employed the Corbin and Strauss variant of grounded theory methodology, informed by symbolic interactionism, and applied the EQUATOR guidelines for qualitative research publication (COREQ). METHODS: Data collection entailed semi-structured interviews with experienced clinical nurses (n =20) across diverse settings. We analysed data by identifying key points in the nurses' coping processes inductively building concepts around these points. RESULTS: The predictor of nurses' outcomes in this grounded theory was their confidence in their ability to cope during the pandemic. When nurses lacked confidence, they experienced working in the context of acute COVID-a state of chaos and anxiety, with negative consequences for nurses. However, when nurses were confident in their abilities to cope with the pandemic, they experienced working in the context of chronic COVID, a calmer state of acceptance. There were many workplace factors that influenced nurses' confidence, including adequacy of personal protective equipment, clear information and guidance, supportive leadership, teamwork and adequate staffing. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding clinical nurses' experience of coping during COVID-19 is essential to maintain the nursing workforce during similar disasters. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurse leaders can target areas that support nurses' confidence, such as adequate PPE and staffing. In turn, increased confidence enables clinical nurses to cope during disasters such as a global pandemic.","output":"A grounded theory of clinical nurses' process of coping during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning on graphs has been extensively studied in both academic and industry.

The aim was to identify factors influencing clinical outcome in elderly patients with anterior circulation AIS treated with MT (intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)). In a retrospective, monocentric study, analysis of prospectively collected data of 138 patients (80 years) was performed. IVT was an independent negative predictor (OR 0.356; 95% CI: 0.134-0.942) and female sex an independent positive predictor (OR 4.179, 95% CI: 1.300-13.438) of 3-month good clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale 0-2). Female sex was also an independent negative predictor of 3-month mortality (OR 0.244, 95% CI: 0.100-0.599). Other independent negative predictors of 3-month good clinical outcome were older age, lower pre-stroke self-sufficiency, more severe neurological deficit and longer procedural intervals. Mortality was also independently predicted by longer procedural interval and by the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (p < 0.05 in all cases).

The purpose of this study is to describe the time taken by participants to present to general practitioner-led (GP) respiratory clinics for assessment following the development of symptoms, and to explore associations between demographic and geographic characteristics and the time to presentation. A total of 314,148 participants, who were assessed in GP respiratory clinics between 1 February and 31 August 2021, were included in the analysis. The median age of participants at presentation was 33 years (interquartile range, IQR: 15-49). The median time from development of symptoms to presentation for assessment at GP respiratory clinics was 2 days (IQR: 1-3). Participants were more likely to present within one day of symptom onset if they were aged between 15 and 64 years (43.4%), lived in urban areas (40.9%) or were non-Indigenous (40.2%). Participants in New South Wales and Victoria had twice the odds (OR 2.01; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.95, 2.08) of presenting at a GP respiratory clinic within one day of symptom onset in August 2021, when there was a COVID-19 outbreak in those states, than they did in March 2021, when there was no COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. The number of days from symptom onset to presentation at a GP respiratory clinic was strongly associated with the presence of a COVID-19 outbreak. Participant age, location of the clinic, and Indigenous status of participants were also associated with the time to presentation.

PURPOSE: To describe the implementation of an IV room technology-assisted workflow (TAWF) system integrated within a health system's electronic medical record (EMR) and compare the TAWF system's impact in improving workflow at multiple ambulatory infusion pharmacies. SUMMARY: IV room TAWFs help to standardize intravenous admixture operations while incorporating patient safety measures such as ingredient barcode scanning and image capture. The 4 oncology infusion center pharmacies of a large health system implemented a TAWF system integrated within the health system's EMR software, transitioning to the new TAWF system from an external TAWF system operating outside of the EMR. Considerable planning was required to determine the hardware and workflow processes needed for the new integrated TAWF system to function within pharmacy IV rooms. Several operational challenges were encountered during the initial implementation phase of the project. Frequent occurrence of system malfunctions during the product imaging step was the largest problem, which was overcome by special hardware and a software upgrade. The project also involved an evaluation of the integrated TAWF system after implementation to ensure the pharmacies maintained operational efficiency and patient safety. The evaluation showed that after an initial transition period, the new technology was able to maintain IV admixture efficiency and safety. CONCLUSION: This project and subsequent evaluation showed the operational feasibility, efficiency, and safety of a TAWF integrated within the health system's EMR software.","output":"Implementation and evaluation of an IV room technology-assisted workflow system integrated within the electronic medical record at oncology infusion center pharmacies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An estimated 12 million girls aged 15-19 years, and 777,000 girls younger than 15 give birth globally each year.

Around the country, the spread between economically and culturally thriving places and those that are struggling has been increasing. \\"Superstar\\" cities like New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta continue to attract talent and grow, while the economies of other cities and rural areas are left behind. Troublingly, escalating geographic inequality in the United States has arrived hand in hand with serious economic, social, and political problems. Areas that are left behind have not only failed to keep up with their thriving peers;in many ways, they have stagnated and seen opportunities evaporate. At the same time, superstar cities are running up against extreme housing affordability problems, rendering middleclass life all but unsustainable. To make matters worse, the widening gulf between dynamic and stagnant places increasingly feeds into a democratic crisis of unrepresentative government at the federal level. The dominant explanations for widening geographic inequality focus largely on inexorable economic trends. Forces like \\"agglomeration effects\\" and globalization have reshaped the economy, benefitting some areas and harming others. We think these explanations leave out a crucial factor: the effects of specific regulatory choices on economic geography. The Progressive Era and New Deal regulatory order in the United States promoted geographic dispersion of economic activity. The unraveling of this regulatory order around 1980 coincided with the reversal in geographic convergence and the beginning of an era of growing divergence. More specifically, regulatory policies in the areas of transportation, communications, trade, and antitrust helped construct an era of geographic convergence in the mid-twentieth century, and deregulation in those same areas contributed to the rise of geographic inequality over the last generation. Though the COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented awareness of and interest in remote work--raising the possibility of greater economic dispersion--the extent to which this potential can be realized will likely also depend upon regulatory choices. To combat geographic inequality and its attendant downsides, we make the case for reincorporating geographic factors into federal regulatory policymaking in transportation, communications, trade, antitrust, and other domains.

Both the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and the Royal College of Psychiatrists updated their positions in line with that review, and Public Health England published a 152-page report called Dependence and withdrawal associated with some prescribed medicines: an evidence review. The report made several recommendations relevant to general practice. METHOD: In order to facilitate implementation of these recommendations, an online survey was designed to explore United Kingdom general practitioner (GP) experiences, opinions, knowledge and needs in relation to depression, ADs and withdrawal. A total of 66 GPs had completed the survey when COVID-19 occurred. RESULTS: In keeping with previous findings, this small sample of GPs had a predominantly psycho-social perspective on the causes of, and treatments for, depression. They broadly considered ADs effective for moderate/severe depression and ineffective for minimal/mild depression, for which they preferred psychological therapies and social prescribing. There was a marked lack of consistency in GPs knowledge about the incidence and duration of withdrawal effects. Only a minority (29%) felt their knowledge about withdrawal was adequate and fewer (17%) believed this about their Ability to distinguish between withdrawal effects and return of the original problem (e.g. depression). Two-thirds (68%) would like more training on these matters. CONCLUSION: It is hoped that even this small sample will be helpful when designing, and seeking funding for, GP training programmes, and when implementing the PHE recommendations for support services, based in the primary care system, for the millions of people contemplating or initiating withdrawal from ADs every year in the UK.","output":"A survey of UK general practitioners about depression, antidepressants and withdrawal: implementing the 2019 Public Health England report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DNAzymes (catalytic DNA) have gained significant diagnostic and therapeutic applications with increasing research output over the years.

Therefore, in the present study, research articles on DNAzymes from 1995 to 2019 were extracted from Web of Science (SCI-Expanded) after which, 1037 articles were imported into Rstudio (version 3.6.2) and analysed accordingly. The highest number of articles was published in 2019 (n = 138), while the least was in 1995 (n = 1). The articles were published across 216 journals by 2344 authors with 2337 multi-author and 7 single authors. The most prolific authors were Li Y (n = 47), Liu J (n = 46), Wang L (n = 33), Willner I (n = 33) and Zhang L (n = 33). The top three most productive countries were China (n = 2018), USA (n = 447) and Canada (n = 251). The most productive institutions were Hunan University, China (n = 141), University of Illinois, USA (n = 139) and Fuzhou University, China (n = 101). Despite the increasing interest in this field, international collaborations between institutions were very low which requires immediate attention to mitigate challenges such as limited funding, access to facilities, and existing knowledge gap.","output":"Systematic mapping of DNAzymes research from 1995 to 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The spread of COVID-19 and the associated stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of gyms and fitness centers has drastically influenced health behaviors leading to widespread reductions in physical activity (PA). The recent Call to Action from the American College of Sports Medicine has promoted \\"innovative strategies to promote PA during the COVID-19 pandemic\\". We aimed to identify individual-level factors that protected against declines in PA levels amid the COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS We utilized the Pennington Biomedical COVID-19 Health Behaviors Survey for our analyses and used mixed-effect linear and generalized linear models to estimate the effects of individual-level factors on changes in PA levels during the COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS Participants (n=4,376) provided information on PA behaviors before and during the COVID-19 shutdown. Overall, PA levels declined by a mean (SD) of 112 (1,460) MET minutes/week during the COVID-19 shutdown; however, changes in PA were heterogeneous, with 55% of the participants reporting increases in or maintenance of PA during that time. Several social and demographic factors were significantly related to declines in PA, including high pre-pandemic PA levels, living alone (difference=118 MET minutes/week), low household income (difference between the highest and lowest income group=363 MET minutes/week), COVID-19-related changes in income (difference=110 MET minutes/week), and loss of employment (difference=168 MET minutes/week). Substitution of pre-pandemic gym attendance with the purchase and use of home exercise equipment or exercise through virtual fitness platforms promoted increases in PA during the COVID-19 shutdown. CONCLUSIONS While promoting PA through the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider demographic factors, which greatly influence health behaviors and implementation of, and access to, replacement behaviors. Promotion of such strategies could help maintain PA levels during potential future stay-at-home orders.","output":"Factors Protecting against a Decline in Physical Activity during the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canthoplasty as a cosmetic procedure appears to be on the rise in the West.

Therefore, the regulation of cellular levels of 2-5A is a key point of control in antiviral innate immunity. Cellular 2-5A levels are determined by IFN-inducible 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) and by enzymes that degrade 2-5A. Importantly, many coronaviruses (CoVs) and rotaviruses encode 2-5A-degrading enzymes, thereby antagonizing RNase L and its antiviral effects. A-kinase-anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7), a mammalian counterpart, could possibly limit tissue damage from excessive or prolonged RNase L activation during viral infections or from self-double-stranded RNAs that activate OAS. We show that these enzymes, members of the two-histidine phosphoesterase (2H-PE) superfamily, constitute a subfamily referred here as 2,5-PEs. 2,5-PEs from the mouse CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (NS2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (NS4b), group A rotavirus (VP3), and mouse (AKAP7) were investigated for their evolutionary relationships and activities. While there was no activity against 3,5-oligoribonucleotides, they all cleaved 2,5-oligoadenylates efficiently but with variable activity against other 2,5-oligonucleotides. The 2,5-PEs are shown to be metal ion-independent enzymes that cleave trimer 2-5A (2,5-p(3)A(3)) producing mono- or diadenylates with 2,3-cyclic phosphate termini. Our results suggest that the elimination of 2-5A might be the sole function of viral 2,5-PEs, thereby promoting viral escape from innate immunity by preventing or limiting the activation of RNase L.","output":"Specificity and Mechanism of Coronavirus, Rotavirus, and Mammalian Two-Histidine Phosphoesterases That Antagonize Antiviral Innate Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conditions affecting the brachial plexus and its branches can cause lameness and/or neurological deficits.

Although its aetiology is still unclear, it is well-known that allergen exposure and virus infections can temporarily induce or aggravate airway hyperresponsiveness. Among these environmental factors, virus infections appear to be clinically most relevant, since recent epidemiological studies have shown that most asthma exacerbations in children are associated with positive nasopharyngeal viral identification. The pathogenesis of virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness has been investigated by experimental virus infections in animals and in man. Intranasal inoculation and/or inhalation of live attenuated influenza virus, or certain strains of rhinovirus, have been shown to induce airway hyperresponsiveness to various bronchoconstrictor stimuli in man. This indicates that experimental virus-infection, like allergen challenge, is an appropriate investigational model of asthma. The mechanisms of virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness are still unclear, but may, in part, be similar to those involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. Currently investigated hypothesis include: epithelial damage or dysfunction, immunological responses, inflammatory mediator release, cholinergic and/or noncholinergic reflexes, and impaired beta-adrenoceptor function. Careful experimental studies, using modern laboratory techniques, are needed to unravel the role of viruses in the development of airway hyperresponsiveness.

Descriptive analyses examined associations as well as within- and between-gender differences of the measured variables. Gender-specific serial indirect effects analyses aimed to explain the impact of TRD on HRQoL through psychological processes, notably anxiety, depressive symptoms, and somatization symptoms. Results: Both female and male patients yielded lower mental than physical HRQoL and negative associations between the measured psychological variables and HRQoL. Compared to male patients, female patients reported higher levels of tinnitus-related- and wider psychological distress, other somatization symptoms (e.g., headaches), and impairments in mental and physical HRQoL. For each gender, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and somatization symptoms fully mediated the effect of TRD on mental and physical HRQoL. A double-dissociation revealed an interaction of somatization symptoms and depression on the TRD-HRQoL association in women, and of somatization symptoms and anxiety in men.

Radiolabeling of Affibody molecules with the positron-emitting nuclide 68Ga would permit the use of positron emission tomography (PET), providing better resolution, sensitivity, and quantification accuracy than single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The synthetic anti-HER2 ZHER2:S1 Affibody molecule was conjugated with DOTA at the N-terminus, in the middle of helix 3, or at the C-terminus. The biodistribution of 68Ga- and 111In-labeled Affibody molecules was directly compared in NMRI nu/nu mice bearing SKOV3 xenografts. The position of the chelator strongly influenced the biodistribution of the tracers, and the influence was more pronounced for 68Ga-labeled Affibody molecules than for the 111In-labeled counterparts. The best 68Ga-labeled variant was 68Ga-[DOTA-A1]-ZHER2:S1 which provided a tumor uptake of 13  1 %ID/g and a tumor to blood ratio of 39  12 at 2 hours after injection. 111In-[DOTA-A1]-ZHER2:S1 and 111In-[DOTA-K58]-ZHER2:S1 were equally good at this time point, providing a tumor uptake of 15 to 16 %ID/g and a tumor to blood ratio in the range of 60 to 80.

Despite international recommendations, countries should consider their context-specific situation and define local research priorities. We aimed to exercise a priority-setting activity to identify the knowledge gaps and suggest research priorities in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. METHODS: First, we tried to identify the contextual knowledge gaps based on an online survey, performing key informant interviews (i.e. health professionals, policy-makers and managers) and media analysis. We also performed a literature review and considered international research priorities for COVID-19. Subsequently, we prepared a list of research questions and challenges to respond to the COVID-19 crisis in Iran using a systems approach. Then we mapped approved COVID-19 research projects in the country to research questions. Finally, we compared the identified research questions (not challenges) with the prioritized research from international organizations and then prioritized them for Iran. RESULTS: We found risk factors and epidemiological dissemination patterns of the virus and its consequences in an epidemiology domain, implementation of clinical and hygiene in a clinical management domain, genetic studies for targeting prevention and treatment in a candidate treatment and vaccine research and development (R&D) knowledge domain, examination of the manifestations of ethics in society instead of ethics in research in an ethics domain, care, access and health system and public health and participation in response to public health and clinical research as two sub-domains of a social sciences domain, and finally, no new questions in either the virology, transmission, diagnosis or animal and environmental domain.

Co\\\\infection rates were 14.79% in children and 8.47% in adults. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza infections occurred more often in younger children. Influenza and HRV occurred more often in older children. Influenza and coronavirus were mostly isolated in winter and spring, RSV in fall and winter and HRV in fall and spring. Children with HRV were more likely to have history of asthma. Adults with the same virus as their child often accompanied  2\\\\year\\\\old\\\\positive children and were more likely to be symptomatic compared to adults with different viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses, while presenting the same suite of symptoms, possess distinct seasonal cycles and affect individuals differently based on a number of identifiable factors, including age and history of asthma.","output":"Respiratory viruses in pediatric emergency department patients and their family members"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with psychiatric illness feel the brunt of the intersection of many of our society's and our health care system's disparities, and the vulnerability of this population during the Covid\\\\19 pandemic cannot be overstated.

The substrate recognition mechanism has been fully elucidated for mammalian DPP IV by crystal structure analyses but not for bacterial orthologues. Here, we report the crystal structures of a bacterial DPP IV (PmDAP IV) in its free form and in complexes with two kinds of dipeptides as well as with a non-peptidyl inhibitor at 1.90 to 2.47 ? resolution. Acyl-enzyme intermediates were observed for the dipeptide complexes of PmDAP IV, whereas tetrahedral intermediates were reported for the oligopeptide complexes of mammalian DPP IVs. This variation reflects the different structural environments of the active site Arg residues, which are involved in the recognition of a substrate carbonyl group, of mammalian and bacterial enzymes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that PmDAP IV is a closer relative of dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8 and DPP9, DPP IV-family enzymes) than DPP IV. These results provide new insights into the substrate recognition mechanism of bacterial DAP IVs and may assist in the development of selective inhibitors for DAP IVs from pathogenic asaccharolytic bacteria, which utilise proteins or peptides as an energy source.","output":"Crystal structures of a bacterial dipeptidyl peptidase IV reveal a novel substrate recognition mechanism distinct from that of mammalian orthologues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the seven known coronaviruses infecting humans; HKU1, 229E, NL63, OC43, acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, the last three of which can cause severe symptoms in patients.

The hallmark of its pathology is the demyelinated plaque with reactive glial scar formation. However, a detailed analysis of the patterns of demyelination, oligodendroglia cell pathology and the reaction of other tissue components suggests that the pathogenesis of myelin destruction in this disease may be heterogeneous. In this review we present a new classification scheme of lesional activity on the basis of the molecular composition of myelin degradation products in macrophages. When these criteria are used, different patterns of demyelination can be distinguished, including demyelination with relative preservation of oligodendrocytes, myelin destruction with concomitant and complete destruction of oligodendrocytes or primary destruction or disturbance of myelinating cells with secondary demyelination. Furthermore, in some cases a primary selective demyelination may be followed by secondary oligodendrocyte loss in the established lesions. Finally, some extraordinarily severe conditions may result in destructive lesions with loss of myelin, oligodendrocytes, axons and astro\\\\cytes. This heterogeneity of plaque pathology is discussed in the context of recent experimental models of inflammatory demyelination, which show that different immunological pathways may lead to the formation of demyelinated plaques that reveal the diverse structural aspects described above.

Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda. RESULTS: Application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis CClike virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs. PCR assays for each specific virus combined with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, one TTSuV-2 variant as well as PPV4 in the serum samples and thereby confirming the findings from the 454 sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Using a viral metagenomic approach we have made an initial analysis of viruses present in bushpig sera and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in a wild African Suid.

However, acute febrile hepatitis as an initial or predominant manifestation of COVID-19 has been rarely reported. Case presentation: A 34-year-old man without underlying medical conditions presented with fever of unknown origin for two weeks in the absence of respiratory symptoms or other complaints. Laboratory testing revealed isolated acute hepatitis, for which an extensive microbiological work-up did not reveal identification of the causal agent. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab was negative on two occasions and initial serology for SARS-CoV-2 (at 15 days from symptoms onset) was also negative. However, repeated SARS-CoV-2 serological testing at 30 days demonstrated seroconversion leading to the diagnosis of COVID-19-related hepatitis.

In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome occurred in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) of China. We aimed to evaluate competency in RID prevention procedures in terms of hospital performance and physician behavior. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 10 tertiary general public hospitals in 3 cities of IMAR. In each hospital, we chose the respiratory and earCnoseCthroat outpatient departments (OPDs) and the emergency department (ED) to invite patients with symptoms of cough to join the study before they consulted a physician. After their consultation, we asked the patients to complete a checklist to score the performance of the departments and the behavior of their physicians in terms of RID prevention practices according to international professional guidelines. RESULTS: From 711 respondents, in the domain of hospital performance, display of posters on directive to wash hands after coughing/sneezing had an average score of 0.452 (range 0C1), while other cough etiquette items had scores averaging between 0.33 and 0.39. The average score for air ventilation was 0.66. For physicians performance, informing patients the location of handwashing facilities scored the highest (0.62), while low scores were seen for offering a mask to coughing patients (0.14) and encouraging coughing patients to distance themselves from others (0.17). Most RID prevention procedures received low scores in EDs in both hospital performance and physician behavior domains. CONCLUSION: Hospitals in IMAR should improve their performance in RID prevention procedures, especially in giving information to RID patients through the display of posters. The practice of physicians in preventing respiratory infection spread was suboptimum.

How these factors relate to each other would have important implications in managing the spread of the disease and its mental health consequences. To this end, we modeled their interrelationships using a structural equation model. Older adults (N = 421), aged 60 and above completed various questionnaires-COVID-19 Fear Inventory, Short form of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, COVID-19 Risky and Protective Behaviours, Resilience Appraisals Scale, and Compassion Scale during a COVID-19 lockdown. The relationships between these variables were assessed within a structural equation model. The findings showed that older adults who are more compassionate engage in protective behaviors more frequently. Additionally, frequent practice of protective behaviors and greater resilience predicted lower anxiety among older adults. Greater fear predicted higher anxiety levels but did not significantly influence an individual's engagement in protective behaviors. Mental health services are crucial in fostering resilience and supporting older adults psychologically.

It is more important now than ever to evaluate SSAs vulnerability to COVID-19, a global pandemic becoming endemic to the region after it perhaps gets eliminated from the other world regions.Method: The International Health Regulations (IHR [2005]) and Global Health Security Index (GHSI) scores for SSA before COVID-19 reached the region were obtained and evaluated to assess its health security preparedness. The number of cases, deaths and stringency measures of the first year of the virus in the region were used to ascertain the possibility of the virus becoming endemic to SSA. By this, COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths of the region were obtained from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The stringency measures put in place by each country were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT).

Cannabis users experienced 30% job loss and increased loneliness [P < 0.001, Bayes factor (BF)10 > 100], while contact with partners (P = 0.005, BF10 = 8.21) and families improved (P < 0.001, BF10 = 19.73), with no differences between cannabis users and control. Generally, mental health problems (all Ps > 0.277, all BF10 < 0.139) did not change, but individual differences were significant and severity of cannabis use pre-lockdown, COVID-19-related worries, change in anxiety, expansion motives, social motives and family contact all uniquely related to variance in change in cannabis use or CUD. CONCLUSIONS: While cannabis use among daily cannabis users in the Netherlands increased at the group level during the period of COVID-19 lockdown, the effect of the first months of lockdown on cannabis use disorder severity and mental wellbeing varied significantly among individual daily cannabis users.","output":"For better or for worse?

Coefficients and covariance matrices for the temperature term were then synthesised using random effects meta-analysis to yield pooled estimates of the exposure-lag response with effects presented as the relative risk (RR) and cumulative RR (RR(cum)). The cumulative exposure response curve was non-linear, with peak risk at 15.1 C and declining risk at progressively lower and higher temperatures. The lowest RR(cum) at 0.2 C is 0.72 [0.56,0.91] times that of the highest risk. Due to this non-linearity, the shape of the lag response curve necessarily varied by temperature.

All vaccine doses were received post-transplant, only mRNA vaccines were used for V3 and V4 dosing. All participants had serological testing performed post-V2 and at least once prior to their 1st dose of vaccine. Results586/724 (80.9%) patients were infection-naive post-V3; 141/2586 (24.1%) remained seronegative at 31 (21-51) days post-V3.

The impact of plastic or self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs) on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue sampling is unclear. This study aimed to assess, using strict pathological criteria, whether stents impair fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or fine-needle biopsy (FNB). METHODS All patients with a solid mass in the head of the pancreas who underwent EUS-guided tissue sampling between 2010 and 2016 at our unit were included. Factors with possible impact on diagnostic performance were analyzed using logistic regression. Analysis was performed using both strict (malignant only) and less strict (suspicious for malignancy) cutoffs. RESULTS Of 631 individuals undergoing 698 procedures, 535 (84.8 %) had a final diagnosis of malignancy, 141 had SEMS, 149 had plastic stents, and 341 had no stent. Using strict criteria, SEMS were associated with an increased occurrence of incorrect diagnosis of EUS tissue sampling, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.96 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.24 - 3.10). Increasing tumor size (OR 0.72, 95 %CI 0.59 - 0.87), increasing number of passes (OR 0.84, 95 %CI 0.72 - 0.99), and fork-tip biopsy needle (OR 0.52, 95 %CI 0.31 - 0.86) were independently associated with a decrease in incorrect diagnosis. Repeat tissue sampling was more common with SEMSs (10.2 %) than with plastic stents (2.9 %) or no stents (4.5 %) (P < 0.02). CONCLUSION SEMS use had a negative impact on tissue diagnosis in pancreatic head masses, whereas use of a fork-tip biopsy needle and increasing number of passes were independently associated with improved accuracy.","output":"Impact of metal and plastic stents on endoscopic ultrasound-guided aspiration cytology and core histology of head of pancreas masses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic are unknown. We evaluated data from the Veterans Affair Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS) data to determine rates of STI and PrEP linkage in our Veterans. METHODS: We extracted patient-level data on demographics, STI testing (chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis), International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes and refills of TDF-FTC and TAF-FTC. We compared the ratio of positive STI tests in 2018, 2019 and 2020 using chi-square tests. Individuals eligible for PrEP were defined as patients with a newly positive STI result or an ICD diagnosis of: high risk sexual behavior; an STI mentioned above; or gender identity disorder. We excluded anyone with a positive HIV test or a creatinine >1.8. We identified patients initiated on PrEP through pharmacy refill data to define initiation of care. Finally, we used chi-square tests to compare differences of initiation of PrEP between years and demographics. RESULTS: The STI positivity rate significantly increased (p< 0.01) from 44.2% (2018) and 42.9% (2019) to 61.6% (2020) [Table 1]. The median ages of those who had a positive STI test were 50 (2018), 44 (2019) and 44 (2020). In 2020, 17% of patients eligible for PrEP filled PrEP. Engagement was similar (p=0.33) in 2019 and 2018, where 14% and 11.6% of patients eligible for PrEP received a prescription (p-value=0.33) [Figure 1]. The median age of those refilling PrEP were: 44 (2018); 43 (2019) and 41 (2020)). In 2020, we observed a statistically significant difference (p< 0.01) in initiation of PrEP in care among Black patients with 11.7% of eligible patients filling PrEP as compared to white patients (26.2%) and other races (23.3%) [Figure 2].

This Article argues that these interactions create a nuanced and salient courtroom culture that separates courtroom insiders from courtroom outsiders. The authors use the Cook County courts, specifically the George N. Leighton Courthouse at 2650 N California Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, to investigate courtroom culture and construct a thematic portrait of one of the largest criminal court systems in the United States. Using this newly constructed data source of rich ethnographic observations, this Article draws out a series of themes that illuminate two types of failures that characterize courtroom culture in Cook County: micro-level failures and structural-level failures. While micro-level failures may fall into the category of \\"mistakes,\\" when aggregated they impede the effective functioning of the criminal legal system. Structural-level failures, by contrast, threaten the fair and efficient operation of courts even in the absence of individual errors. This Article uses examples of real court interactions gathered through observational research to illustrate both categories of failures in the Cook County criminal courts. This Article then situates these observations in the context of legal cynicism theory to explain the impact of courtroom culture on those most directly impacted by the system. This Article concludes with recommendations for courtroom culture reform, looking for positive examples in our data and considering new possibilities for courts in the era of COVID-19.

Their release in the environment is of great concern since their consumption is a major factor for antibiotic resistance, one of the most important threats to human health. Their occurrence and fate in agricultural systems have been extensively investigated in recent years. Yet whilst their biotic and abiotic degradation pathways have been thoroughly researched, their biotransformation pathways in plants are less understood, such as in case of trimethoprim. Although trimethoprim has been reported in the environment, its fate in higher plants still remains unknown. A bench-scale experiment was performed and 30 trimethoprim metabolites were identified in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), of which 5 belong to phase I and 25 to phase II. Data mining yielded a list of 1018 ions as possible metabolite candidates, which was filtered to a final list of 87 candidates. Molecular structures were assigned for 19 compounds, including 14 TMP metabolites reported for the first time. Alongside well-known biotransformation pathways in plants, additional novel pathways were suggested, namely, conjugation with sesquiterpene lactones, and abscisic acid as a part of phase II of plant metabolism. The results obtained offer insight into the variety of phase II conjugates and may serve as a guideline for studying the metabolization of other chemicals that share a similar molecular structure or functional groups with trimethoprim. Finally, the toxicity and potential contribution of the identified metabolites to the selective pressure on antibiotic resistance genes and bacterial communities via residual antimicrobial activity were evaluated.

DESIGN: A multicenter cross-sectional design. PARTICIPANTS: In total 2249 undergraduate nursing students participated. METHODS: The study was conducted in 7 universities in participating countries (Greece, Albania, Cyprus, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, and Kosovo) through a web survey. Data was collected during December 2020-January 2021 in all countries. RESULTS: Forty three point 8% of students agreed to accept a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, while the acceptance was higher among Italian students. The factors for intention to get vaccinated were male gender (p = 0.008), no working experience in healthcare facilities during the pandemic (p = 0.001), vaccination for influenza in 2019 and 2020 (p < 0.001), trust in doctors (p < 0.001), governments and experts (p = 0.012), high level of knowledge (p < 0.001) and fear of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding of factors that influence students' decision to accept COVID-19 vaccination could increase the acceptance rate contributing to a management of the pandemic.","output":"Factors influencing nursing students' intention to accept COVID-19 vaccination: A pooled analysis of seven European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During public health emergencies, people with opioid use disorder (PWOUD) may be particularly impacted. Emergent disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupt already-strained harm reduction efforts and treatment availability. This study aims to answer three research questions. How do public health emergencies impact PWOUD? How can health systems respond to novel public health emergencies to serve PWOUD? How can the results of this scoping review be contextualized to the province of Alberta to inform local stakeholder responses to the pandemic? METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using the 6-stage Arksey and OMalley framework to analyse early-pandemic and pre-pandemic disaster literature. The results of the scoping review were contextualized to the local pandemic response, through a Nominal Group Technique (NGT) process with frontline providers and stakeholders in Alberta, Canada. RESULTS: Sixty one scientific journal articles and 72 grey literature resources were included after full-text screening. Forty sources pertained to early COVID-19 responses, and 21 focused on OUD treatment during other disasters. PWOUD may be more impacted than the general population by common COVID-19 stressors including loss of income, isolation, lack of rewarding activities, housing instability, as well as fear and anxiety. They may also face unique challenges including threats to drug supplies, stigma, difficulty accessing clean substance use supplies, and closure of substance use treatment centres. All of these impacts put PWOUD at risk of negative outcomes including fatal overdose. Two NGT groups were held. One group (n = 7) represented voices from urban services, and the other (n = 4) Indigenous contexts. Stakeholders suggested that simultaneous attention to multiple crises, with adequate resources to allow attention to both social and health systems issues, can prepare a system to serve PWOUD during disasters. CONCLUSION: This scoping review and NGT study uncovers how disasters impact PWOUD and offers suggestions for better serving PWOUD.

We herein evaluated if previous exposure to antihypertensive, hypoglycaemic, and lipid-lowering drugs increases the risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on three cohorts of COVID-19 adult patients between March 2020 and May 2020 at the Vall dHebron University Hospital. Information relating to the patient lifestyle, comorbidities, and chronic exposures was retrieved from primary healthcare electronic records. Three cohorts were examined, namely patients who had died or required intensive care treatment (ICU/Death [ICU-D] Cohort), patients who required hospitalisation (Hospitalisation [HOSP] Cohort), and patients who only attended the emergency department (Emergencies [EM] Cohort). Descriptive statistics and a multivariate logistic regression model were used to investigate associations with drug exposure, where EM was employed as the reference cohort. Results: We included 1,778 patients: 417 (23.5%) from the ICU-D Cohort, 1,052 (59.2%) from the HOSP Cohort, and 309 (17.4%) from the EM Cohort. After multiple imputations and data adjustment by potential confounders, no statistically significant association was observed between the COVID-19 severity and the use of antihypertensives, hypoglycaemic agents, or lipid-lowering agents, with the exception of calcium channel blockers (CCB) (ICU-D Cohort: OR 2.23;CI 95% [1.03C4.83];P = 0.042).

The effects of protracted social isolation, and media related misinformation's about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulting in increased fear/stress related to the insufficiently known illness. The aim was to assess the influence of the COVID-19 health crisis on patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 29 adult CIDP patients was performed. The Medical Research Council scale was used to evaluate muscle strength. The degree of functional disability was measured using the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment disability scale. The overall quality of life (QoL) was self-estimated on a 0-100 numeric rating scale. We also used a specifically designed 22-question-survey about COVID-19. RESULTS: Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, 62% of CIDP patients were concerned. The daily activities of 55% of patients were negatively influenced by the pandemic. During the COVID-19 outbreak, 21% of patients reported their CIDP got worse. In 39% of CIDP patients, the influence of the pandemic on CIDP therapy was reported (reducing the dose or time interval or even discontinuation). The mean value of the self-estimated QoL was 64  19. Independent predictors of worse QoL were age of patients (beta = -0.35, p < 0.05) and fear of the COVID-19 (beta = -0.34, p < 0.05).

While millions of individuals have become infected, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggest this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes, but rarely are researchers able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these to previous years of data on the same individuals.ObjectivesWe seek to answer two overarching questions by combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students participating in a longitudinal study for the past two years. First, have behaviors and mental health changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to previous time periods within the same participants? Second, did behavior and mental health changes track the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media?MethodsBehaviors were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs). Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term (the term in which the coronavirus pandemic started), as compared to prevous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models.ResultsDuring the initial COVID-19 impacted academic term (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001), relative to the previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and week of academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term, were strongly associated with increased coronavirus-related news. When mental health metrics (e.g., depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P<.05) were significantly associated with coronavirus-related news.ConclusionsCompared with prior academic terms, individuals in Winter 2020 were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, are associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods that could reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.","output":"Mental Health and Behavior During the Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study in College Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted Australian universities and their libraries but has been felt most strongly by students and staff who are already marginalised.

Those factors' relevance and their impact on sexual function in this population have not yet been established. AIM: To evaluate the impact of the pandemic on sexual function in healthcare professionals and medical students at a reference center in the treatment of COVID-19 in Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis with online questionnaires about sexual function was sent to health professionals and medical students from the HC-FMUSP medical complex. The questionnaire evaluated Total Sexual and Masturbatory Frequency prior and during the pandemic, libido and sexual satisfaction changes with a detailed inquire about demographics and personal factors. An objective assessment of sexual function was also made using the validated sexual quotient questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in intercourse frequency, libido, and overall sexual satisfaction, in a sample of healthcare professionals particularly vulnerable to the pandemic effects. RESULTS: A total of 1,314 responses were available with a mean age of 37 years. Worsening of sexual satisfaction was reported by 44.5% of the participants, with the following associated factors: Lower libido, missing Nightlife, Higher Masturbatory Frequency, and isolation from the partner. Remaning sexualy actively and having higher sexual frequency appear to decrease the chance of worsening sexual function. Worsening of Libido was reported by 37% and had several associated factors, including missing of Nightlife, older age, isolation from the partner among others. Being male and sexually active was associated with a smaller chance of reporting lower libido. CONCLUSION: We were able to observe a sharp drop in Libido and General Sexual Satisfaction. Although an increase in pornography consumption and masturbatory frequency did occur, these factors were not associated with greater sexual satisfaction. The impact of COVID-19 on this population's sexual health is not to be underestimated and should be further studied in the follow-up of the pandemic.

However, in the course of applying the MDIPA to characterize large numbers of whole blood samples, we observed several instances of unusual aberrant staining patterns, most notably CD19 expression on non-B cells, which can potentially confound data analysis and lead to erroneous interpretation of results when using this assay. Here, we report that this complex phenomenon is mediated by donor-specific plasma factors that mediate non-specific interactions between specific antibodies in the MDIPA panel. Our findings additionally suggest specific strategies that can be used to mitigate the issue, including the use of PBMCs or lysed/washed whole blood to remove endogenous plasma prior to staining, or blocking specific antibodies in the MDIPA panel.","output":"Donor-Specific Plasma Factors Contribute to Aberrant Staining Artifacts with a Commercial Lyophilized Mass Cytometry Antibody Panel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations in hospitalized children with SARS-CoV-2 have not been studied systematically.

METHODS: Study was designed as a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial performed by Emergency Medical Services in Poland. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation in prehospital setting were included.

COVID-19 restrictions have exacerbated safety concerns, stressed the health care system, and put patients at high risk after discharge. Here we describe pilot results from the Joint Stroke Transitional Technology-Enhanced Program (JSTTEP) designed to reduce post-stroke complications, avoid hospital readmission, and enhance recovery. Methods: JSTTEP is a novel, interprofessional program for patients discharged from the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Stroke Center. In the first weeks after hospital discharge, stroke patients complete a series of multidisciplinary telemedicine visits to (1) reduce the risks of adverse events in the transition from hospital to home, and (2) develop a plan to facilitate a full recovery. The first joint visit is with stroke neurology and physical therapy for risk mitigation, and the second is with physiatry and occupational therapy for a recovery plan. Patients and caregivers participate in an interactive, online group education session covering topics about vascular risk factor modification, nutrition, exercise, fall prevention, and self-management skills. Results: In the first 4 months of the program, 50 patients were enrolled. Average age was 61 years;26/50 (52%) were women, 23/50 (46%) were African American, and mean baseline NIHSS was 5.4. Of those 45/50 (90%) completed their visit, with 4/50 (8%) requiring conversion from video to phone visit. Unexpected 30-day hospital readmission rate was 3/50 (6%), one of whom was readmitted due to neurological issues identified during the JSTTEP appointment.

ResultsFrom 26/4/2020-7/8/2021, 27,869 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive episodes occurred in 27,692 participants (median 42 years (IQR 22-58)); 13,427 (48%) self-reported symptoms (\\"symptomatic positive episodes\\"). The comparator group comprised 3,806,692 test-negative visits (457,215 participants); 130,612 (3%) self-reported symptoms (\\"symptomatic negative visit\\"). Reporting of any symptoms in positive episodes varied over calendar time, reflecting changes in prevalence of variants, incidental changes (e.g. seasonal pathogens, schools re-opening) and vaccination roll-out. There was a small increase in sore throat reporting in symptomatic positive episodes and negative visits from April-2021. After May-2021 when Delta emerged there were substantial increases in headache and fever in positives, but not in negatives. Although specific symptom reporting in symptomatic positive episodes vs. negative visits varied by age, sex, and ethnicity, only small improvements in symptom-based infection detection were obtained; e.g. adding fatigue/weakness or all eight symptoms to the classic four symptoms (cough, fever, loss of taste/smell) increased sensitivity from 74% to 81% to 90% but tests per positive from 4.6 to 5.3 to 8.7.

The biotin and streptavidin were used as model enzymes. In the presence of target streptavidin (SA), the streptavidin hybridized with G3MB-b (biotin-linked-G-triplex molecular beacon) perfectly and formed larger steric hindrance, which hindered the hydrolysis of probes by exonuclease III (Exo III). In the absence of target streptavidin, the exonuclease III successively cleaved the stem of G3MB-b and released the G-rich sequences which self-assembled into a G-triplex and subsequently activated the fluorescence signal of thioflavin T. Compared with the traditional G-quadruplex molecular beacon (G4MB), the G3MB only needed a lower dosage of exonuclease III and a shorter reaction time to reach the optimal detection performance, because the concise sequence of G-triplex was good for the molecular beacon design. Moreover, fluorescence experiment results exhibited that the G3MB-b had good sensitivity and specificity for streptavidin detection.

METHODS: We re-sequenced the locus using both Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RS II sequencing technologies and we mapped RNA-seq data from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) to this finalized chIFITM locus. Using SureSelect probes capture probes designed to the finalized chIFITM locus, we sequenced the locus of a different chicken breed, namely a White Leghorn, and a turkey. RESULTS: We confirmed the Gallus Gallus v5 consensus except for two insertions of 5 and 1 base pair within the chIFITM3 and B4GALNT4 genes, respectively, and a single base pair deletion within the B4GALNT4 gene. The pull down revealed a single amino acid substitution of A63V in the CIL domain of IFITM2 compared to Red Jungle fowl and 13, 13 and 11 differences between IFITM1, 2 and 3 of chickens and turkeys, respectively. RNA-seq shows chIFITM2 and chIFITM3 expression in numerous tissue types of different chicken breeds and avian cell lines, while the expression of the putative chIFITM1 is limited to the testis, caecum and ileum tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Locus resequencing using these capture probes and RNA-seq based expression analysis will allow the further characterization of genetic diversity within Galliformes.

We show that mask mandates are associated with a statistically significant decrease in new cases (-3.55 per 100K), deaths (-0.13 per 100K), and the proportion of hospital admissions (-2.38 percentage points) up to 40 days after the introduction of mask mandates both at the state and county level. These effects are large, corresponding to 14% of the highest recorded number of cases, 13% of deaths, and 7% of admission proportion. We also find that mask mandates are linked to a 23.4 percentage point increase in mask adherence in four diverse states. Given the recent lifting of mandates, we estimate that the ending of mask mandates in these states is associated with a decrease of -3.19 percentage points in mask adherence and 12 per 100K (13% of the highest recorded number) of daily new cases with no significant effect on hospitalizations and deaths. Lastly, using a large novel survey dataset of 847 thousand responses in 69 countries, we introduce the novel results that community mask adherence and community attitudes towards masks are associated with a reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results have policy implications for reinforcing the need to maintain and encourage mask-wearing by the public, especially in light of some states starting to remove their mask mandates.","output":"Association between COVID-19 outcomes and mask mandates, adherence, and attitudes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aims to empirically estimate the nexus of green bond financing with renewable energy index OECD countries.

This asymmetrical role of green bonds is confirmed on renewable energy indicators over the sample period. OECD countries injected 31% role of green bond financing on renewable energy index constructs, and it raised 9.4% of per unit energy efficiency in renewable energy systems; by this, the study findings warrant maximum support through public office, energy ministries, and departments for energy efficiency optimization. The study presents multiple policy implications to enhance renewable energy generation for energy efficiency through different alternative sources. Despite growing literature, the empirical discussion on this topicality is still shattered and less studied, which is extended and contributed by recent research.

Neurological and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 have been reported, but there are limited data on incidence rates and relative risks. Methods. Using retrospective cohort studies and time-to-event analysis, we estimated the incidence of ICD-10 diagnoses in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; Parkinsonism; Guillain-Barre syndrome; nerve/nerve root/plexus disorders; myoneural/muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders; substance misuse; and insomnia. Data were obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (over 81 million patients). We compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory infections using a Cox model. We investigated the effect on incidence estimates of COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalization and encephalopathy (including delirium and related disorders). Findings. 236,379 patients survived a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Among them, the estimated incidence of neurological or psychiatric sequelae at 6 months was 33.6%, with 12.8% receiving their first such diagnosis. Most diagnostic categories were commoner after COVID-19 than after influenza or other respiratory infections (hazard ratios from 1.21 to 5.28), including stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, dementia, and psychotic disorders. Findings were equivocal for Parkinsonism and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Amongst COVID-19 cases, incidences and hazard ratios for most disorders were higher in patients who had been hospitalized, and markedly so in those who had experienced encephalopathy. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, including comparisons against an additional four index health events. Interpretation. The study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity following COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, those who had severe COVID-19.

This study was conducted to explore the extent of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experiences among nurses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan. METHOD: This study used a cross-sectional study design with a convenience sampling approach. A sample of 259 participants completed the study questionnaires, including a socio-demographic questionnaire and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, between May and July 2020. RESULT: The prevalence of PTSD among the study participants was 37.1%. The majority of study participants who exhibited PTSD symptoms presented the lowest level of PTSD (17%). The results indicated significant differences in overall COVID-19-related PTSD according to the participant's age (F = 14.750, P = .000), gender (F = 30.340, P = .000), level of education (F = 51.983, P =.000), years of experience (F = 52.33, P = .000), place of work (F = 19.593, P = .000), and working position (F = 11.597, P = .000), as determined by one-way ANOVA. CONCLUSION: Nurses must be qualified and accredited to cope with reported PTSD cases and their consequences in relation to COVID-19 outbreaks.

Despite this, a safe and effective PEDV vaccine against highly virulent strains is unavailable, making PEDV prevention and control challenging. Lactogenic immunity induced via the gut-mammary gland-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, remains the most promising and effective way to protect suckling piglets from PEDV. Therefore, a successful PEDV vaccine must induce protective maternal IgA antibodies that passively transfer into colostrum and milk. Identifying variables that influence lymphocyte migration and IgA secretion during gestation and lactation is imperative for designing maternal immunization strategies that generate the highest amount of lactogenic immune protection against PEDV in suckling piglets. Because pregnancy-associated immune alterations influence viral pathogenesis and adaptive immune responses in many different species, a better understanding of host immune responses to PEDV in pregnant swine may translate into improved maternal immunization strategies against enteric pathogens for multiple species.

Here, we characterized that porcine torovirus (PToV, family Tobaniviridae, order Nidovirales) 3CLpro autocatalytically release itself from the viral precursor protein by self-cleavage. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested that PToV 3CLpro, as a serine protease, employed His53 and Ser160 as the active-site residues. Interestingly, unlike most nidovirus 3CLpro, the P1 residue plays a less essential role in N-terminal self-cleavage of PToV 3CLpro Substituting either P1 or P4 residue of substrate alone has little discernible effect on N-terminal cleavage. Notably, replacement of the two residues together completely blocks N-terminal cleavage, suggesting that N-terminal self-cleavage of PToV 3CLpro is synergistically affected by both P1 and P4 residues. Using a cyclized luciferase-based biosensor, we systematically scanned the polyproteins for cleavage sites, and identified (FXXQ&#8595;A/S) as the main consensus sequences. Subsequent homology modeling and biochemical experiments suggested that the protease formed putative pockets S1 and S4 between the substrate. Indeed, mutants of both predicted S1 (D159A, H174A) and S4 (P62G/L185G) pockets completely lost the ability of cleavage activity of PToV 3CLpro In conclusion, the characterization of self-processing activities and substrate specificities of PToV 3CLpro will offer helpful information for the mechanism of nidovirus 3C-like proteinase's substrate specificities and the rational development of the anti-nidovirus drugs.IMPORTANCECurrently, the active-site residues and substrate specificities of 3C-like protease (3CLpro) differ among nidoviruses, and the detailed catalytic mechanism remains largely unknown.

Unlike coronaviruses and arteriviruses, PToV 3CLpro employed His53 and Ser160 as the active-site residues that recognize a Glutamine (Gln) at the P1 position. Surprisingly, mutations of P1-Gln impaired the C-terminal self-processing but did not affect N-terminal self-processing. The \\"noncanonical\\" substrate specificity for its N-terminal self-processing was attributed to the Phenylalanine (Phe) residue at the P4 position in the N-terminal site. Furthermore, a double glycine (neutral) substitution at the putative P4-Phe-binding residues (P62G/L185G) abolished the cleavage activity of PToV 3CLpro suggested the potential hydrophobic force between the PToV 3CLpro and P4-Phe side chains.","output":"Characterization of Self-processing Activities and Substrate Specificities of Porcine Torovirus 3C-like Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Experience in treating human coronavirus (HCoV) infections might help to identify effective compounds against novel coronaviruses.

The P272L mutation in SARS-Cov-2 S-protein is known to be highly relevant to the viral escape associated with the second pandemic wave in Europe. Epitope-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition is a key factor in determining the T-cell immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 epitope. Although several data-driven methods for predicting epitope-specific TCR recognition have been proposed, they remain challenging owing to the enormous diversity of TCRs and the lack of available training data. Self-supervised transfer learning has recently been demonstrated to be powerful for extracting useful information from unlabeled protein sequences and increasing the predictive performance of the fine-tuned models in downstream tasks. Here, we present a predictive model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), employing self-supervised transfer learning, to predict SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitope-specific TCR recognition. The fine-tuned model showed notably high predictive performance for independent evaluation using the SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCR CDR3{beta} sequence datasets. In particular, we found the proline at position 4 corresponding to the P272L mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein269-277 epitope (YLQPRTFLL) may contribute substantially to TCR recognition of the epitope through interpreting the output attention weights of our model.

If surveillance fails to address the needs of practitioners and policy-makers, it is likely that there will be loss of confidence. Current surveillance systems are reasonably effective at detecting significant events that are localised in time and space. It is more difficult to detect diffuse and progressive events with a slow increase over time or sporadic and widespread events without obvious links to time, place or person. Detection of these events relies on good data collection, comparative background data and sophisticated analytical tools. To improve surveillance systems, we need methods with the appropriate sensitivity and specificity for the outputs desired. Targeted surveillance should enable better ascertainment of those cases which must be considered and those which can be dismissed. New methods, such as mathematical modelling and geographical information systems, support conventional surveillance in moving events into the known and predictable category. It is important to integrate surveillance across local, regional and international levels and to base surveillance on local public health structures. The purpose and value of data aggregation at each level and the amount of detail needed at each level must be carefully evaluated. The key to all these improvements is developing the workforce. Surveillance needs individuals with a broad range of skills: clinical, epidemiological, anthropological, and mathematical; in particular, people who can think laterally.

We went from busy lives spent largely away from home to spending most of our time at home while daily facing deepening national crises. With the violent, needless death of George Floyd, the simmering tensions around race in America boiled over, sending thousands into the streets to protest racial injustices. The world of science education has largely avoided discussing racism in our classes, but we can no longer ignore it. The events of the spring and summer have highlighted our need to integrate conversations and reflections on justice into science education. In this work, we argue that service learning can build this understanding from both theory and experience. Using a critical online service-learning framework, we have developed a service-learning course that incorporates dialogic communication, cross-contextual reflections, and positioning oneself as an ally. This perspective allows science and the community to prioritize relationships and humanity and reflect on our roles as professionals using the online interacting space. This course, taught at the beginning of the pandemic, focuses on critical online service learning for those studying public health. We discuss the challenges we faced moving critical service-learning pedagogy online and the compounding issues brought on by the pandemic itself.","output":"Critical Online Service-Learning Pedagogy: Justice in Science Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to assess the perceived impact of the lockdown, imposed to control the spreading of COVID-19, on the adherence of Italian celiac disease (CD) subjects to the gluten-free diet by a web-based survey. A total of 1983 responses were analyzed, 1614 (81.4%) by CD adults and 369 (18.6%) by parents/caregivers of CD children/adolescents. The compliance with the GFD was unchanged for 69% of the adults and 70% of the children, and improved for 29% of both. The factors increasing the probability to report stricter compliance were the presence of CD symptoms in the last year before the lockdown (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-2.26), a partial usual adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.2-3.06), and having tried recipes with naturally gluten-free ingredients more than usual (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.96) for adults; the presence of CD symptoms in the last year (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.21-3.47), still positive CD antibodies (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14-3.13), and other family members with CD (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.3-3.85) for children/adolescents.

Less is known however regarding dispositional traits that may protect against negative psychological outcomes. This study examined the prospective association between COVID-19 stressors and psychological symptoms, and whether self-compassion (referring to a dispositional tendency of relating to oneself kindly) would moderate this association. A convenience sample of 212 university students and working adults (60.4% female;Mage = 20.92 years) based in Singapore completed measures assessing COVID-19 stressors (perceived COVID-19 health risk, economic impact, and impact on daily life), psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms), and self-compassion 2 months apart. Results indicated that perceived COVID-19 health risk at baseline predicted anxiety symptoms 2 months later, above and beyond baseline anxiety symptoms. Self-compassion moderated the association between perceived COVID-19 health risk and depressive symptoms, and the relationship between perceived impact on daily life and anxiety symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of self-compassion in alleviating psychological symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This article answers calls for greater reflection on and transparency in the analysis of data across multiple modes of expression. Building on previous approaches, we propose an analytical framework for interpreting visuo-verbal research data that draws on Roland Barthess tripartite classification of text-image relations into illustration, anchorage, and relay. We explore how our framework can be put into practice by applying it to photographs and written texts generated as part of the Living with an eating disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic project, focusing on three settings represented by participants: the hospital ward, the home, and natural environments. We subsequently reflect on some of the strengths and limitations of our framework in light of its application and with respect to established approaches to analyzing visuo-verbal data. Our framework of Text-Image Relations Analysis enables researchers to explore text-image relations as constitutive of meaning without privileging one semiotic mode over the other.

The objective of this living systematic review is to document the prevalence of post COVID-19 conditions 4-12 weeks (short-term) and >12 weeks (long-term) after COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of primary peer-reviewed published literature reporting on the prevalence of the symptoms, sequelae and difficulties conducting usual activities []4 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. We adapted a previous search strategy used by the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and updated it to search for new research published until January 15, 2021 in Embase, Medline, PsychInfo, and Cochrane Central. Two independent reviewers screened references; one reviewer extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty in the evidence while another verified them. Prevalence data from laboratory-confirmed individuals were meta-analyzed, where appropriate, using a random effects model and synthesized separately in the short- and long-term periods after COVID-19 diagnosis; data from clinically-diagnosed populations were synthesized narratively. Results: Of the 2807 unique citations, 36 observational studies met our inclusion criteria. Over 100 post COVID-19 conditions were reported in laboratory-confirmed individuals. Eighty-three percent (95%CI: 65-93%; low certainty) and 56% (95%CI: 34-75%; very low certainty) reported persistence or presence of one or more symptoms in the short- and long-term, respectively.

In swine so far only little information about this lymphocyte population exists. Phenotypical analyses with newly developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against porcine NKp46 recently revealed that in blood NKp46(-) and NKp46(+) cells with NK phenotype exist with comparable cytotoxic properties. In spleen a third NKp46-defined population with NK phenotype was observed that was characterised by a low to negative CD8 and increased NKp46 expression. In the current study it is shown that this NKp46(high) phenotype was correlated with an increased expression of CD16 and CD27 compared to the CD8(+)NKp46(-) and NKp46(+) NK-cell subsets in spleen and blood. Additionally NKp46(high) NK cells expressed elevated levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on mRNA level. Functional analyses revealed that splenic NKp46(high) NK cells produced much higher levels of Interferon- and Tumor Necrosis Factor- upon stimulation with cytokines or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate/Ionomycin compared to the other two subsets. Furthermore, cross-linking of NKp46 by NKp46-specific mAbs led to a superior CD107a expression in the NKp46(high) NK cells, thus indicating a higher cytolytic capacity of this subset. Therefore porcine splenic NKp46(high) NK cells represent a highly activated subset of NK cells and may play a profound role in the immune surveillance of this organ.","output":"Porcine CD8(dim/-)NKp46(high) NK cells are in a highly activated state"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The HIV infection is a chronic disease that causes neurocognitive impairment (NI) and has been related with early development of frailty. We aimed to study the main risk factors for neurocognitive disorders and frailty in HIV older adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 40 HIV individuals older than 65 years under antiretroviral therapy in Hospital del Mar (Barcelona) recruited between November 2019 and October 2020. Data has been obtained through clinical scores and a blood sample to evaluate NI and frailty and has been analyzed with non-parametric tests and a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Among the 40 patients admitted for the study, 14 (35%) had positive screening for NI. We found that HIV individuals with nadir CD4+ T-cell count lower than 350 cells/mm(3) had 39.7 more risk for NI (95% CI 2.49C632.10; p = 0.009).

We describe the epidemiological and laboratory data from one of the first such outbreaks in Ontario to assess factors associated with its severity, and the impact of progressive interventions for infection control over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We obtained line list and outbreak data from the public health unit to describe resident and staff cases, severity and distribution of cases over time and within the outbreak facility. Where available, we obtained data on laboratory specimens from the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and performed whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral specimens from the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 65 residents of the long-term care home, 61 (94%) contracted SARS-CoV-2, with a case fatality rate of 45% (28/61). Among 67 initial staff, 34 (51%) contracted the virus and none died. When the outbreak was declared, 12 staff, 2 visitors and 9 residents had symptoms. Resident cases were located in 3 of 4 areas of the home. Phylogenetic analysis showed tight clustering of cases, with only 1 additional strain of genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 identified from a staff case in the third week of the outbreak. No cases were identified among 26 new staff brought into the home after full outbreak measures were implemented. INTERPRETATION: Rapid and undetected viral spread in a long-term care home led to high rates of infection among residents and staff. Progressive implementation of outbreak measures after the peak of cases prevented subsequent staff cases and are now part of long-term care outbreak policy in Ontario.","output":"Investigation of a severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a long-term care home early in the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Surgical success of cochlear implantation is usually measured through speech perception and quality of life questionnaires. Although these questionnaires cover a broad spectrum of domains, they do not evaluate the consciousness of wearing a cochlear implant (CI) and how this impacts the daily life of patients. To evaluate this concept we aimed to develop and validate a standardized patient reported outcome measure (PROM) for use in cochlear implant users. Methods: Development and evaluation of the COchlear iMPlant AwareneSS (COMPASS) questionnaire was realized following the COSMIN guidelines in three phases: (1) item generation, (2) qualitative pilot study to ensure relevance, comprehensiveness, comprehensibility, and face validity, and (3) quantitative survey study for the assessment of reliability (test-retest) with 54 participants. Results: Nine domains of CI awareness were identified through literature research and interviews with experts and patients. These resulted in the formulation of 18 items which were tested with a pilot study, after which 3 items were deleted. The final 15-item COMPASS questionnaire proved to have good validity and satisfactory reliability. The intraclass correlation coefficient calculated for items with continuous variables ranged from 0.66 to 0.89 with seven out of eight items scoring above the acceptable level of 0.7. The Cohen's kappa calculated for items with nominal variables ranged from -0.4 to 0.78 with 11 (sub)items out of 15 scoring above fair to good agreement. Measurement error analysis for items with continuous variables showed a mean difference of -2.18 to 0.22. The calculated 95% limits of agreement for these items revealed no statistically significant difference between the two administered questionnaires. For items with nominal variables, the percentages of agreement calculated, ranged between 0 and 95%, and 83.3 and 96.6% for positive and negative agreement, respectively.

The prevalence of burnout among American oncologists was 44% in a 2014 survey. The purpose of this survey was to determine the national prevalence of burnout indicators and report work engagement among Canadian radiation oncologists. Materials and Methods: Between November 2019 and March 2020 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic), an online questionnaire was distributed electronically to 333 Canadian radiation oncologists, across 49 centres, through the National Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology mailing list. The survey included 62 questions determining job engagement, and validated burnout scale The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) (22 questions). Results: Two-hundred forty-one of the 333 surveyed Canadian radiation oncologists (72%) completed the questionnaire and were included in this analysis. Responses to the MBI showed that 15% of radiation oncologists met the strict criteria for burnout (i.e. negative scores in all three domains: exhaustion, depersonalization, and low accomplishment). Another 60% scored negative in at least one of the three burnout domains. Using the more commonly reported definition of burnout (negative scores in either exhaustion and/or depersonalization), 44% of Canadian radiation oncologists reported burnout. Only 25% had positive scores in all three domains, and were fully engaged in their work. Three-domain burnout varied among jurisdictions with highest prevalence in British Columbia (22%) and lowest in Quebec (3%). The responses to work engagement questions revealed significant concerns regarding inefficiency in workflow (50%), heavy workloads (>50%), poor work-life balance (68%), lack of control over the work environment (47%) and lack of recognition from administrators (45%). Forty-eight percent perceive the atmosphere at their primary work area as chaotic and hectic. Within the last three years, 41% had considered leaving their institution to work elsewhere and 51% were considering reducing their full-time equivalent (FTE). Reassuringly, 80% reported a sense of overall ability to provide high quality care and a 59% feel they have a supportive network of colleagues and 80% are willing to try something new. The top four strategies identified by respondents aimed to improve work-life quality were: (1) more support staff at work;(2) more efficient care models;(3) more resources for patients;and (4) lighter workloads for physicians. Conclusions: Our survey showed that only 25% of Canadian radiation oncologists are fully engaged in their work, whereas 15% met the strict criteria for burnout and 44% met the commonly used burnout criteria. With the rising incidence of cancer and complexity of care, there is an urgent need for system change, leverage enthusiasm to try something new, and develop appropriate strategies to improve the well-being of the Canadian radiation oncologist workforce.","output":"The Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology 2020 Radiation Oncologist Burnout and Work Engagement Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive autopsies, also known as minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS), have proven to be an alternative to complete diagnostic autopsies (CDAs) in places or situations where this procedure cannot be performed.

To contribute to the understanding of COVID-19 pathology, we have conducted ultrasound (US)Cguided MITS as a strategy. METHODS: This case series study includes 80 autopsies performed in patients with COVID-19 confirmed by laboratorial tests. Different organs were sampled using a standardized MITS protocol.

The results showed that ARS dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation and arrested the G0/G1 phase cell cycle in both BRL-3A and AML12 liver cells. Western blotting demonstrated that ARS induced a significant downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2), CDK4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 in various levels and then caused apoptosis when the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased. Conversely, the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine can significantly inhibit cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by ARS. Thus, the data confirmed that ARS exposure impairs normal liver cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and this detrimental action may be associated with intracellular ROS accumulation.

Methods: Selected results from the Canadian Survey on Disability are examined with a focus on working-age youth and adults (aged 15 to 64) with a range of disabilities. Findings: Five figures of disability and corresponding conceptual models are identified. These hidden figures of disability are the uncounted, those with needs unsupported, youth in multiple transitions, potential workers, and what may be called 'the fearful'. Several models of disability are identified intersecting with the evidence. These are the absent citizen, biomedical model and charitable model, social and economic integration model, human rights and full citizenship, and psycho-emotional model of affective disablism and ableism. Discussion: Hidden figures of disability are more than statistical tests and texts;more than calculations derived from quantitative research where people become a data point.The function of drawing hidden figures is to disclose and describe the bodily experiences of people with disabilities in their social positions and structural contexts.

The most fearful aspect is the unavailability of any concrete guidelines and treatment or protective strategies for reducing mortality or morbidity caused by this virus. Repurposing of drugs, antivirals, convalescent plasma and neutralizing antibodies are being considered for treatment but are still questionable in lieu of the conflicting data, study design and induction of secondary infections. Stem cell therapy has seen substantial advancements over the past decade for the treatment of various diseases including pulmonary disorders with severe complications similar to COVID-19. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received particular attention as a potential therapeutic modality for SARS-CoV2 infection due to their ability to inhibit cytokine storm, a hallmark of severe COVID-19. MSCs secretion of trophic factors and extracellular vesicles mediated intercellular signaling are considered as principal contributing factors for tissue recovery. Although, recent preliminary studies have established the safety and efficacy of these cells without any severe secondary complications in the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infection, the rational use of MSCs on a large scale would still require additional relevant clinical investigations and validation of postulated mechanisms of these cells.

It has been previously demonstrated that conditions such as tracheal stenosis, asthma and even lung transplantation may worsen with reflux and these patients have few symptoms of GERD. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people who needed mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy increased. Our objective was to demonstrate the prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with tracheostomy and describe its characteristics. METHODS: Esophageal manometry and 24 h pH-metry was performed in 137 consecutive patients with a tracheostomy already in a chronic phase, independent of symptoms. Inquire on respiratory and digestive symptoms was also carried out at the time of the examination. Prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux was identified in this population and description of the groups with reflux and without it, as well as comparison between them. RESULTS: Of the 137 patients, 49 were male, the average age was 40.94  17.3 and the body mass index was 26.3  4.85. The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux was 45.2%. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups with and without reflux. In the reflux group, the mean DeMeester score was 36.5  20.8 and the presence of lower sphincter hypotonia was found in only 31% of the patients and was not correlated with reflux between the groups (p = 0.285). Regarding the symptoms, 48% had heartburn symptoms and only 30% had a combination of typical symptoms (heartburn + regurgitation). CONCLUSION: The presence of tracheostomy is related to an increased prevalence of reflux, even without typical symptoms most of the time. The mechanism for this is still unknown, perhaps the altered respiratory dynamics has a role. These patients should be investigated with functional exams if they develop any condition that may be affected by reflux.","output":"794 DOES TRACHEOSTOMY PREDISPOSE GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework provides a rich and actionable repository of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures.

In reaction to the absurdity of the world, Albert Camus hoped that revolt would not imprison human beings in passivity but would lead them to act in defence of freedom, justice and the relief of suffering. Camus thus aimed in his writings to set out an ethic of understanding. His novel The Plague tells of an epidemic that strikes a city and decimates all generations. What was the place of the elderly in this catastrophe? The experience of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which mainly affected the elderly, prompted us to explore this issue, which, beyond the pandemic, raises questions about a society's view of the elderly and about intergenerational relationships. It was then tempting to peruse the whole of Camus's writings and to explore the way he viewed the elderly - he who rose up against an absurd world but was intent on resisting it, he who had Doctor Rieux, visiting his patients across the city, say that a world without love was like a dead world.

The mortality data of the subsets of patients who suffered from micro- or macrovascular complications is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the causes of in-hospital death of patients with type 2 diabetes, especially the patients with microvascular, macrovascular and, both micro-macrovascular complications. METHODS A total of 12,159 patients with type 2 diabetes were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to analyze the causes of death. Type 2 diabetic subjects with microvascular, macrovascular and both micro-macrovascular complications were further classified and compared to patients without micro- and macrovascular complications in the logistic regression analysis of the risk of death. RESULTS Pneumonia increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with microvascular, macrovascular and both micro-macrovascular complications, with adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 2.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-4.18), 3.26 (1.71-6.24) and 3.96 (2.17-7.22), respectively.

Home ventilation machines (i.e., respiratory assist devices and portable ventilators) can now wirelessly transmit usage and performance data to cloud-based web servers for remote access by participating clinicians. In this Focused Review, we provide an update on available technology, suggest practical applications for clinical care and research, and review supporting literature. Remote monitoring permits early data review, refinement of device settings to optimize ventilatory function, and troubleshooting if a new problem arises after initial setup. Data from home spirometry and noninvasively measured blood gas tensions can complement ventilator data to reflect physiological response. Acknowledging a paucity of published outcome studies, remote telemonitoring may be a cost-effective strategy to reduce emergency room visits, urgent clinic appointments, and hospitalizations. Ongoing clinical trials in Europe aim to expand on the benefit of this rapidly evolving technology. However, several barriers may hinder widespread implementation, especially in the United States. Clinicians must familiarize themselves with each ventilator manufacturers proprietary software to safely leverage this technology for improving care. Legal and ethical considerations threaten clinician interest. Medical insurance payers must adapt a reimbursement scheme to incentivize clinicians and durable medical equipment companies to perform this time-consuming service.

In patients with obesity and OSAS scheduled for bariatric surgery (BS), guidelines recommend at least 4 weeks of preoperative continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Low-calorie ketogenic diets (LCKDs) promote pre-BS weight loss (WL) and improve HTN, DLP, and IR. However, it is unclear whether pre-BS LCKD with CPAP improves OSAS more than CPAP alone. We assessed the clinical advantage of pre-BS CPAP and LCKD in patients with obesity and OSAS. Seventy patients with obesity and OSAS were randomly assigned to CPAP or CPAP+LCKD groups for 4 weeks. The effect of each intervention on the apneaChypopnea index (AHI) was the primary endpoint. WL, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, HTN, DLP, and IR were secondary endpoints. AHI scores improved significantly in both groups (CPAP, p=0.0231; CPAP+LCKD, p=0.0272). However, combining CPAP and LCKD registered no advantage on the AHI score (p=0.863). Furthermore, body weight, CRP levels, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced in the CPAP+LCKD group after 4 weeks (p=0.0052, p=0.0161, p=0.0008, and p=0.0007 vs baseline, respectively), and CPAP+LCKD had a greater impact on CRP levels than CPAP alone (p=0.0329).

Objectives This study aimed to explore and compare the community pharmacists roles, practices, implemented safety measures, and psychological toll in Croatia and Serbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study employing an online survey was conducted in two countries over a period of 6 weeks during 2020. The survey consisted of 65 items that explored sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their workplaces, including safety measures, pharmaceutical care, and their psychology while working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results In total, 574 pharmacists participated in the study, of which 90% were female with a mean age of 38 years (interquartile range 30.5C47). Study identified new pharmacists roles that evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic; manufacturing hand sanitizers in community pharmacies, online patient counseling and medicine home delivery. Croatian and Serbian pharmacists exhibited disparities in their incorporated safety measures (higher for Croatia; p  0.001), satisfaction with work organization and counseling activities (higher for Serbia; p < 0.001). Serbian participants were less satisfied with the public perception of their role during the pandemic, and overall satisfaction was low, with a negative impact on mood and productivity. Conclusions The study revealed the implications for community pharmacists during the pandemic in both countries. The extent of systematic and logistical support provided to them during the pandemic could be an explanation for the highlighted differences.

Insufficient EPO production leads to anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although recombinant EPO is effective to improve anemia, no reliable REP cell lines limit further progress of research and development of novel treatment. METHODS: We screened Epo mRNA expression in mouse fibroblast cell lines. Small interfering RNA specific for HIF1 or HIF2 was transfected to study Epo expression in C3H10T1/2 cells. The effect of transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) on HIF-EPO axis was studied in C3H10T1/2 cells and mice. RESULTS: Similar to mouse REP pericytes, C3H10T1/2 cells differentiated to -smooth muscle actin+ myofibroblasts after exposure to TGF-?1. Specific HIF knockdown demonstrated the role of HIF2 in hypoxia-induced Epo expression. Sustained TGF-?1 exposure increased neither DNA methyltransferase nor methylation of Epas1 and Epo genes. However, TGF-?1 repressed HIF2-encoding Epas1 promptly through activating activin receptor-like kinase-5 (ALK5), thereby decreasing Epo induction by hypoxia and prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitor roxadustat. In mice with pro-fibrotic injury induced by ureteral obstruction, upregulation of Tgfb1 was accompanied with downregulation of Epas1 and Epo in injured kidneys and myofibroblasts, which were reversed by ALK5 inhibitor SB431542. CONCLUSION: C3H10T1/2 cells possessed the property of HIF2-dependent Epo expression in REP pericytes. TGF-?1 induced not only the transition to myofibroblasts but also a repressive effect on Epas1-Epo axis in C3H10T1/2 cells. The repressive effect of TGF-?1 on Epas1-Epo axis was confirmed in REP pericytes in vivo.

While these documents differ in scope, they share a utilitarian focus on the maximization of benefit. This utilitarian view necessarily marginalizes certain groups, in particular individuals with increased medical needs. MAIN BODY: Here, we posit that engagement with the disability critique demands that we broaden our understandings of justice and fairness in clinical decision-making and patient triage. We propose the capabilities theory, which recognizes that justice requires a range of positive capabilities/freedoms conducive to the achievement of meaningful life goals, as a means to do so. Informed by a disability rights critique of the clinical response to the pandemic, we offer direction for the construction of future clinical triage protocols which will avoid ableist biases by incorporating a broader apprehension of what it means to be human. CONCLUSION: The clinical pandemic response, codified across triage protocols, should embrace a form of justice which incorporates a vision of pluralistic human capabilities and a valuing of positive freedoms.

In the wake of this, to assist medical specialists, these images can be used and trained in an intelligent system in order to aid the determination of the different diseases that can be identified from analyzing these images. Classification plays an important role in this regard; it enhances the grouping of these images into categories of diseases and optimizes the next step of a computer-aided diagnosis system. The concept of classification in machine learning deals with the problem of identifying to which set of categories a new population belongs. When category membership is known, the classification is done on the basis of a training set of data containing observations. The goal of this paper is to perform a survey of classification algorithms for biomedical images. The paper then describes how these algorithms can be applied to a big data architecture by using the Spark framework. This paper further proposes the classification workflow based on the observed optimal algorithms, Support Vector Machine and Deep Learning as drawn from the literature.

Sources of data: The co-inquiry comprised 3 interviews and 3 focus groups with 50 European experts. From the literature search we included 108 papers to develop the literature-based programme theory. In stage 3, we used data from 40 participants gathered in 6 interviews and 2 focus groups to refine the programme theory. In stage 4, five interviewees from different health care systems consolidated our programme theory. Result: Requirements for successful QCs are governmental trust in GPs abilities to deliver quality improvement, training, access to educational material and performance data, protected time, and financial resources. Group dynamics strongly influence success; facilitators should ensure participants exchange knowledge and generate new concepts in a safe environment.

Alcohol misuse varies across the US and is related to poorer health and comorbidities that likely affect the severity of COVID-19 infection. High levels of pre-pandemic alcohol misuse in some counties may have set the stage for worse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, this relationship may depend on how rural a county is, as access to healthcare in rural communities has lagged behind more urban areas. The objective of this study was to test for associations between county-level COVID-19 mortality, pre-pandemic county-level excessive drinking, and county rurality. METHOD: We used national COVID-19 data from the New York Times to calculate county-level case fatality rates (n = 3,039 counties and county equivalents; October 1 -December 31, 2020) and other external county-level data sources for indicators of rurality and health. We used beta regression to model case fatality rates, adjusted for several county-level population characteristics. We included a multilevel component to our model and defined state as a random intercept. Our focal predictor was a single variable representing nine possible combinations of low/mid/high alcohol misuse and low/mid/high rurality.

Methods: Qualitative approach of data collections and thematic analysis were used. Results: The outcomes indicate that COVID-19 situations gain the highest momentum by increasing alarmingly. It shows significant differences after two months since March 2020 it has reported the first case in Ethiopia. The government took several measures ranging from public health emergency response to the state of emergency. The communication strategy and state of emergency are in place to reduce the prospective risks of COVID-19. The strategy segmented the population by tailoring activities of risk communication and community engagement at all levels. The government has strongly obtained various measures like lockdown and a state of emergency. However, it was not strict and has not been heavy-handed that much. Conclusion: KAP's practices are inadequate to fight and minimize the impacts of the pandemic. Such negligence among the public and related factors undermined the preparedness and responses towards COVID-19 in Ethiopia. New cases and deaths are non-stoppable. The government is using several strategies and need to strengthen those efforts to mobilize and upbeat the KAP's of the public through different communication forms to reinforce the existing efforts and alleviate socio-cultural, political, economic factors to drive out COVID-19 among the people. The efforts are building and strengthening up to the standard level of KAP's while enhancing and promoting existing strategies and the drawing of new documents by focusing on high-risk parts of the population.","output":"COVID-19 in Ethiopia: Assessment of How the Ethiopian Government has Executed Administrative Actions and Managed Risk Communications and Community Engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim was to evaluate the physical properties and anti-bacterial activity of resin cement containing ursolic acid (UA) and determine the optimal concentration of UA. Five types of experimental resin cement were prepared according to UA concentration (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt%). Flexural strength, film thickness and in vitro cytotoxicity were measured to confirm whether the resin was appropriate under International Organization for Standardization (ISO) criteria. Fifty extracted human molars were prepared, and indirect resin inlays were cemented with experimental resins. Acid-resistant nail varnish was applied, except for the 2-mm area around the restoration. Artificial caries were induced for 6 days through Streptococcus (S.) mutans (ATCC25175). Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) was used to evaluate the caries progression. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Dunnett correction were used to statistically analyze the data. In all groups, the physical property of flexural strength, film thickness, and cytotoxicity were satisfied for ISO criteria (p > 0.05). On &#8710;F (-%) and &#8710;Q (-%a?

METHODS: The prevalences of exposure were estimated using the sample of 35,571 employees from the 2015 European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) for all countries together and each country separately. Relative risks (RR) were obtained via literature reviews and meta-analyses already published. The studied outcomes were: coronary/ischemic heart diseases (CHD), stroke, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease, venous thromboembolism, and depression. Attributable fractions (AF) for each exposure and overall AFs for all exposures together were calculated. RESULTS: The AFs of depression were all significant: job strain (17%), job insecurity (9%), bullying (7%), and effort-reward imbalance (6%). Most of the AFs of cardiovascular diseases were significant and lower than 11%. Differences in AFs were observed between countries for depression and for long working hours. Differences between genders were found for long working hours, with higher AFs observed among men than among women for all outcomes. Overall AFs taking all exposures into account ranged between 17 and 35% for depression and between 5 and 11% for CHD. CONCLUSION: The overall burden of depression and cardiovascular diseases attributable to psychosocial work exposures was noticeable. As these exposures are modifiable, preventive policies may be useful to reduce the burden of disease associated with the psychosocial work environment.

However, the relationships and interactions between biological factors (eg, genetic polymorphisms, immunological parameters, metabolic products, or infectious diseases) and environmental factors (eg, lifestyle, physical activity, nutrition, and work type or stress at work) as well as their impact on cognitive functions across the lifespan are still poorly understood with respect to their complexity. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the Dortmund Vital Study is to validate previous hypotheses as well as generate and validate new hypotheses about the relationships among aging, working conditions, genetic makeup, stress, metabolic functions, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, and mental performance over the human lifespan with a focus on healthy working adults. The Dortmund Vital Study is a multidisciplinary study involving the Departments of Ergonomics, Immunology, Psychology and Neurosciences, and Toxicology at the Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors at the Technical University of Dortmund (IfADo) in Germany, as well as several national and international partners. METHODS: The Dortmund Vital Study is designed as a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal study. Approximately 600 healthy subjects aged between 20 and 70 years will participate. A wide range of demographic, psychological, behavioral, sensory, cardiovascular, immunological, and biochemical data, a comprehensive electroencephalography (EEG)-based cognitive test battery as well as structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been included in the study. RESULTS: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of IfADo in October 2015. The baseline testing was conducted between 2016 and 2021 and will be repeated every 5 years (3 follow-up measures until 2035). As of March 2020 (until the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), 593 participants have been enrolled. Some results from the cross-sectional part of the study were already published, further results will be published soon. Longitudinal data will be analyzed and published by 2025. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the study will shed light on sources of interindividual differences in the alterations of cognitive functioning with increasing age and reveal biological and lifestyle markers contributing to work ability, longevity, and healthy aging on the one hand, and to risk factors for cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or even dementia on the other hand.

To assure the proper protection without overuse of limited supply of these equipments, screening of patients before surgical or diagnostic procedure was implemented. This study evaluates the results of this screening. METHOD: All patients screened for COVID-19 before procedure warranting either general, locoregional anaesthesia or sedation were included. Screening included a symptom questionnaire by phone, PCR and HRCT chest testing. Surgical or procedural details were registered together with actions taken based on screening results. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-eight screenings were performed on 386 patients. The symptom questionnaire was completed in 72% of screenings. In 371 screenings, PCR testing was performed and negative. HRCT chest found 18 cases where COVID-19 could not be excluded, with negative PCR testing. Three patients had their surgery postponed due to inconclusive screening, and additional measures were taken in three other patients. There were incidental findings in 14% of HRCT chest scans. DISCUSSION: Pre-operative screening will differentiate if PPE is needed for procedures and which patients can safely have elective surgery during this COVID-19 pandemic and in the times to come. HRCT chest has no additional value in the pre-operative screening of asymptomatic patients.

As the developing brain is extremely inaccessible in mammals, cerebral organoids (COs) provide a unique way to investigate neural development and related disorders. The aim of this study was to utilize hyperpolarized (13)C NMR to investigate the metabolism of COs in real-time, in a non-destructive manner. The enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was determined by quantifying the rate of [1-(13)C]lactate production from hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate. Organoid development was assessed by immunofluorescence imaging. Organoid viability was confirmed using (31)P NMR spectroscopy. A total of 15 organoids collated into 3 groups with a group total weight of 20C77 mg were used in this study. Two groups were at the age of 10 weeks and one was at the age of 33 weeks. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated in both age groups, and the LDH activity rate was found to be 1.32  0.75 nmol/s (n = 3 organoid batches).

There has been an attempt to move towards a paperless electronic system in many public healthcare facilities, but owing to lack of funding, this has been a challenge to achieve. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the virus could be transmitted through the physical manipulation of patient records by various categories of staff who handle the records with or without gloves for protection. We discuss a digital option that has been partially used at Tygerberg Hospital (TBH), Cape Town, to avoid SARS-CoV-2 patient hard-copy record manipulation. It includes assignment of a QR code to every patient admitted as a person under investigation or confirmed COVID-19 case. The QR code is synced to one of the many free online medical notes smartphone applications (apps), which are password-protected with patient information privacy regulations (Trello is used at TBH), for daily medical notes review and editing. Upon discharge, all notes made during the patient's hospital stay, together with the discharge summary, are printed to generate a hard copy of notes for filing to avoid violation of the current national and provincial patient records policy. Doing this means that a patient will have a virtual online file through the designated app until discharge, when a physical file will be made for storage and safekeeping. It will keep physical manipulation of patient records to the minimum, and potentially assist in reducing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus among healthcare workers.","output":"Affordable digital innovation to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission among healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Positive-strand RNA viruses, including picornaviruses, utilize cellular machinery for genome replication. Previously, we reported that each of the 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB proteins of Aichi virus (AiV), a picornavirus, forms a complex with the Golgi apparatus protein ACBD3 and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III (PI4KB) at viral RNA replication sites (replication organelles [ROs]), enhancing PI4KB-dependent phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) production. Here, we demonstrate AiV hijacking of the cellular cholesterol transport system involving oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), a PI4P-binding cholesterol transfer protein. AiV RNA replication was inhibited by silencing cellular proteins known to be components of this pathway, OSBP, the ER membrane proteins VAPA and VAPB (VAP-A/B), the PI4P-phosphatase SAC1, and PI-transfer protein . OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1 were present at RNA replication sites. We also found various previously unknown interactions among the AiV proteins (2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB), ACBD3, OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1, and the interactions were suggested to be involved in recruiting the component proteins to AiV ROs. Importantly, the OSBP-2B interaction enabled PI4P-independent recruitment of OSBP to AiV ROs, indicating preferential recruitment of OSBP among PI4P-binding proteins. Protein-protein interaction-based OSBP recruitment has not been reported for other picornaviruses. Cholesterol was accumulated at AiV ROs, and inhibition of OSBP-mediated cholesterol transfer impaired cholesterol accumulation and AiV RNA replication. Electron microscopy showed that AiV-induced vesicle-like structures were close to ER membranes. Altogether, we conclude that AiV directly recruits the cholesterol transport machinery through protein-protein interactions, resulting in formation of membrane contact sites between the ER and AiV ROs and cholesterol supply to the ROs.IMPORTANCE Positive-strand RNA viruses utilize host pathways to modulate the lipid composition of viral RNA replication sites for replication. Previously, we demonstrated that Aichi virus (AiV), a picornavirus, forms a complex comprising certain proteins of AiV, the Golgi apparatus protein ACBD3, and the lipid kinase PI4KB to synthesize PI4P lipid at the sites for AiV RNA replication. Here, we confirmed cholesterol accumulation at the AiV RNA replication sites, which are established by hijacking the host cholesterol transfer machinery mediated by a PI4P-binding cholesterol transfer protein, OSBP. We showed that the component proteins of the machinery, OSBP, VAP, SAC1, and PITPNB, are all essential host factors for AiV replication. Importantly, the machinery is directly recruited to the RNA replication sites through previously unknown interactions of VAP/OSBP/SAC1 with the AiV proteins and with ACBD3. Consequently, we propose a specific strategy employed by AiV to efficiently accumulate cholesterol at the RNA replication sites via protein-protein interactions.","output":"Model of OSBP-Mediated Cholesterol Supply to Aichi Virus RNA Replication Sites Involving Protein-Protein Interactions among Viral Proteins, ACBD3, OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to the need for changes in clinical practice, with new strategies to enable integrated care for patients with headache and neuralgia.

However, understanding the potential applicability, feasibility and impacts of these approaches is necessary if they are to be more widely used. This study aimed to synthesize research that has applied and evaluated citizen science approaches in chronic disease prevention and identify key questions, gaps, and opportunities to inform future work in this field. METHODS: We searched six databases (Scopus, Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, PubMed, and CINAHL) in January 2022 to identify articles on the use of citizen science in prevention. We extracted and synthesized data on key characteristics of citizen science projects, including topics, aims and level of involvement of citizen scientists, as well as methods and findings of evaluations of these projects. RESULTS: Eighty-one articles reported on citizen science across a variety of health issues, predominantly physical activity and/or nutrition. Projects primarily aimed to identify problems from the perspective of community members; generate and prioritize solutions; develop, test or evaluate interventions; or build community capacity. Most projects were small-scale, and few were co-produced with policy or practice stakeholders. While around half of projects included an evaluation component, overall, there was a lack of robust, in-depth evaluations of the processes and impacts of citizen science projects. CONCLUSIONS: Citizen science approaches are increasingly being used in chronic disease prevention to identify and prioritize community-focused solutions, mobilize support and advocacy, and empower communities to take action to support their health and wellbeing.

The viral infection in itself, along with the oncogenic properties of HHV8 and with immune system dysfunction, forms the grounds on which Kaposis Sarcoma may develop. Infection with HHV8 occurs through saliva via close contacts, blood, blood products, solid organ donation and, rarely, vertical transmission. Chronic inflammation and oncogenesis are promoted by a mix of viral genes that directly promote cell survival and transformation or interfere with the regular cell cycle and cell signaling (of particular note: LANA-1, v-IL6, vBCL-2, vIAP, vIRF3, vGPCR, gB, K1, K8.1, K15). The most common development sites for Kaposis sarcoma are the skin, mucocutaneous zones, lymph nodes and visceral organs, but it can also rarely appear in the musculoskeletal system, urinary system, endocrine organs, heart or eye. Histopathologically, spindle cell proliferation with slit-like vascular spaces, plasma cell and lymphocyte infiltrate are characteristic. The clinical presentation is heterogenic depending on the variant; some patients have indolent disease and others have aggressive disease. The treatment options include highly active antiretroviral therapy, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.

PATIENTS During the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 influenza seasons, we enrolled children (6 mo to 17 yr old) who were suspected to have severe viral infection. INTERVENTIONS We collected samples by using a standardized protocol for nasopharyngeal aspirate and nasopharyngeal flocked swabs in nonintubated patients and for endotracheal tube aspirate and nasopharyngeal flocked swabs in intubated patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Viral testing included a single reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction influenza test and the GenMark Respiratory Viral Panel (20 viruses). We enrolled 90 endotracheally intubated and 133 nonintubated children. We identified influenza in 45 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing; the multiplex panel was falsely negative for influenza in two patients (4.4%). Six patients (13.3%) had not been diagnosed with influenza in the PICU. Non-influenza viruses were identified in 172 of 223 children (77.1%). In nonintubated children, the same virus was identified by nasopharyngeal flocked swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirate in 133 of 183 paired samples (72.7%), with +nasopharyngeal aspirate/-nasopharyngeal flocked swabs in 32 of 183 paired samples (17.4%).

Respondents (200) were selected by random sampling using a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive and correlation analysis. Majority of the respondents (71.7%) were male. COVID-19 will have serious negative impacts on the productivity and income of the yam farmers due to sex difference in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 TMPRSS2 regulations. Majority (34.8%) of the respondents were within the age range of 55-64 years which might place them at increased risk of severe impact from COVID-19. Most of the respondents (37.9%) were with First School Leaving Certificate (FSLC) which will be aggravated by global lockdown of education institutions. COVID-19 pandemic has created the largest disruption of education systems due to closure of schools and other learning spaces as well as inability of many parents to work making financing of education to face big challenges. Most of the respondents (35.4%) had farm size of three hectares. Most of the respondents (37.9%) earned between 151,000 and 200,000 per hectare. This income informal economy will be affected by COVID-19 control measures. Majority of the respondents (70.2%) had between 21 to 30 years of yam farming experience. At this length of experience, it is expected that they will be within the age range that is more vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic. Using Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the relationship between socio-economic factors farm characteristics of small-scale yam farmers establishes that farm experience significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with age of the respondents. Marital status was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with age (0.548) and farm experience (0.932) of the respondents.","output":"Yam production in some south east and north central zones of Nigeria beyond COVID-19 for acceleration towards inclusive sustainable development.

Most recently, we have developed a RABV-based ebolavirus (EBOV) vaccine that is efficacious in nonhuman primates. One safety feature of this vaccine is the utilization of a live but replication-deficient RABV construct. In this construct, the RABV glycoprotein (G) has been deleted from the genome, requiring G trans complementation in order for new infectious viruses to be released from the initial infected cell. Here we analyze this safety feature of the bivalent RABV-based EBOV vaccine comprised of the G-deleted RABV backbone expressing EBOV glycoprotein (GP). We found that, while the level of RABV genome in infected cells is equivalent regardless of G supplementation, the production of infectious virus is indeed restricted by the lack of G, and most importantly, that the presence of EBOV GP does not substitute for G. These findings further support the safety profile of this replication-deficient RABV-EBOV bivalent vaccine.","output":"Controlled viral glycoprotein expression as a safety feature in a bivalent rabies-ebola vaccine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Botulinum toxin type A has been used to treat a wide array of neurologic, medical, and aesthetic indications. Several factors contribute to the formation of neutralizing antibodies, such as shorter intervals of treatment, higher dosage, amounts of antigenic proteins, serotypes, and storage of formulations. METHOD This overview followed the Cochrane guideline for overview reviews. The AMSTAR-2 (revised version of A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) tool was used for the critical appraisal of the selected systematic reviews. RESULTS Five systematic reviews consisting of 203 studies (17,815 patients) were included, and their AMSTAR-2 scores were low to critically poor. There was high heterogeneity between the studies. Across the clinical indications, neutralizing antibody prevalence was significantly higher in dystonia, spasticity, and urologic conditions, and nil to insignificant in hyperhidrosis and aesthetic indications. The overall rate for the neutralizing antibody formation across three different formulations, abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, and onabotulinumtoxinA, was 1 to 2.1 percent, with no significant difference between them. RESULTS Although there is debate on the prevalence rate across the different botulinum toxin type A formulations in individual systematic reviews, the overall frequency of the development of neutralizing antibodies and the immunogenicity of abobotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, and onabotulinumtoxinA remain low to insignificant. CONCLUSIONS Properly designed comparative trials are required to explore the difference in the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies across the commercially available botulinum toxin type A products. Such studies should also examine the relevance of neutralizing antibody titer to clinical responsiveness and nonresponse.","output":"Botulinum Toxin Type A Immunogenicity across Multiple Indications: An Overview Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While a palliative approach is generally perceived to be an integral part of the intensive care unit (ICU), the provision of palliative care in this setting is challenging. This review aims to identify factors (barriers and facilitators) influencing a palliative approach in intensive care settings, as perceived by health care professionals. METHOD: A systematic mixed-methods review was conducted. Multiple electronic databases were used, and the following search terms were utilized: implementation, palliative care, and intensive care unit. In total, 1843 articles were screened, of which 24 met the research inclusion/exclusion criteria. A thematic synthesis method was used for both qualitative and quantitative studies. RESULTS: Four key prerequisite factors were identified: (a) organizational structure in facilitating policies, unappropriated resources, multi-disciplinary team involvement, and knowledge and skills; (b) work environment, including physical and psychosocial factors; (c) interpersonal factors/barriers, including family and patients involvement in communication and participation; and (d) decision-making, e.g., decision and transition, goal conflict, multidisciplinary team communication, and prognostication. CONCLUSION: Factors hindering the integration of a palliative approach in an intensive care context constitute a complex interplay among organizational structure, the care environment and clinicians perceptions and attitudes. While patient and family involvement was identified as an important facilitator of palliative care, it was also recognized as a barrier for clinicians due to challenges in shared goal setting and communication.","output":"Factors influencing the integration of a palliative approach in intensive care units: a systematic mixed-methods review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public Policy Relevance Statement This research shows that people turn to media to cope with significant stressors as much as, if not more than, strategies typically recommended by health professionals. Furthermore, across all coping strategies, only TV/movie viewing seemed to mitigate the negative effects of stress on both coping efficacy and proactive coping behavior. Combined, these findings highlight the critical role media can play in helping people cope meaningfully with stress. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique opportunity to answer the critical question: How does media use aid (or subvert) emotion- and problem-focused coping with significant life stressors? Based on a national survey (N = 564) conducted on March 20-25, 2020, the week after COVID-19 was declared a U.S. national emergency, evidence offered strong support for the use and value of media, entertainment media in particular, as key aids to coping processes. Looking across a range of coping techniques, only TV/movie and music consumption emerged as a significant mediator between stress and coping efficacy, which, in turn, was significantly associated with social distancing likelihood. These and other results provide evidence for the important role that media consumption can play in supporting coping processes in ways both unique from more basic emotional regulation and beyond techniques typically recommended by health professionals.","output":"Coping With COVID-19 Stress: The Role of Media Consumption in Emotion- and Problem-Focused Coping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection often leads to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with profound pulmonary patho-histological changes post-mortem.

Here, we analyze specific ARDS regions of interest utilizing a spatial transcriptomic platform on autopsy-derived lung tissue from patients with SARS-CoV-2 (n=3), H1N1 (n=3), and a dual infected individual (n=1). Enhanced gene signatures in alveolar epithelium, vascular tissue, and lung macrophages identify not only increased regional coagulopathy, but also increased extracellular remodeling, alternative macrophage activation, and squamous metaplasia of type II pneumocytes in SARS- CoV-2. Both the H1N1 and dual infected transcriptome demonstrated an enhanced antiviral response compared to SARS-CoV-2.

Autophagy is also related to the invasion ability of endometrial cells and is involved in the pathogenesis of EMS through multi-levels. However, the precise regulatory mechanism of YAP on autophagy in the eutopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) is still unclear. Primary eutopic ESCs of EMS patients (n = 12) and control patients without EMS (n = 9) were isolated and cultured to investigate the expressions of YAP and mTOR, the role of YAP in autophagy, and the effect of the YAP-autophagy signal on the decidualization of the eutopic ESCs. Endometriosis-related sequencing data (GSE51981) in the GEO database were used to find the genes significantly correlated with YAP. We found 155 genes with significant differences in the interaction with YAP in EMS from the dataset, and the autophagy pathway was significantly enriched. Following on from our previous studies of YAP knockdown, overexpression of YAP resulted in an increased expression of mTOR and decreased ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I and autophagy markers, in the eutopic ESCs; transmission electron microscope observation also showed fewer autophagosomes compared with the control cells. Furthermore, ESCs of the Rapamycin-treated group showed significant decidual-like changes with significantly increased decidual prolactin level at 72 h after in vitro decidualization. These results demonstrate that the increased YAP inhibited the level of autophagy by upregulating the mTOR signal in the eutopic ESCs of endometriosis.

In low concentrations, it exerts neurotrophic effects, but higher levels reflect neuronal distress. Recent research suggests that this molecule may be a biomarker of response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We examined the effect of ECT on serum S100B and its utility as 1) a biomarker of a depressive state and 2) a predictor of ECT response. We also wanted to ensure that ECT does not cause a marked serum S100B-elevation, indicating neural distress. METHODS: We measured serum S100B in 22 in-patients treated with ECT due to depression. Depression severity was assessed using 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17). The data were collected before an ECT series, within one week after the series (post-ECT), and at a six-month follow-up. Changes in serum S100B and clinical outcomes were tested using a linear mixed model. A relationship between serum S100B and the clinical outcomes was examined using Spearman and partial correlation. RESULTS: Serum S100B did not change significantly immediately after an ECT series or six months later. The post-ECT serum S100B-change was not associated with the clinical effect (rho=.14, n=22, p=.54). The baseline serum S100B did not predict the clinical effect when controlling for age (r =.02, n=22, df=19, p=.92).

CASE PRESENTATION: On 14 May, two dead bodies (i.e., a 30-years old Indian woman and her six-month-old baby) were found in a Riyadh apartment complex. The perpetrator (a person who kills the others and later commits suicide) C a trained nurse, was in search of a job. The woman's husband was recently retrenched from his technician job at a company in Madinah Airport. Her husband was admitted to a hospital with symptoms related to the COVID-19 infection four days before the suicide incidence. The 70-year-old mother-in-law alerted the neighbors after finding that the apartment is locked from inside and there was no response on knocking the doors. After this, the neighbors gathered and called the police. Police found two dead-bodies after opening the flat and suspected that the child was killed before the woman committed suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present findings, further child filicide-suicide possibilities in families with economically distressed and/or positive COVID-19 status are expected. Hence, proper financial supports, providing authentic information (COVID-19), and mental health promotional strategies are suggested for decreasing incidences of COVID-19 related infanticide-suicide cases.","output":"The first COVID-19 infanticide-suicide case: Financial crisis and fear of COVID-19 infection are the causative factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lockdown was imposed on the Danish society. Reports from other countries that were hit by the COVID-19 pandemic before Denmark instilled fear of flooding of the emergency departments. To mitigate this flooding, increased competencies were conveyed to the paramedics in the ambulances aiming to allow for a release of a higher number of patients prehospitally. The increased competencies in the prehospital personnel were expected to increase the on-scene time and thus the total workload of the ambulances potentially resulting in delays in the acute care. We sought to elucidate the effects of the pandemic on the workload of the prehospital system during the first wave. METHODS: This was a retrospective study using operational data from the regional emergency medical dispatch centre in the Region of Southern Denmark. We collected the number of ambulance runs, the response times, the on-scene times, and the mission outcome of all ambulance runs with lights and sirens in the Region of Southern Denmark during the first wave of the pandemic. We compared the numbers with a similar period in the year before. RESULTS: Compared with the year before the pandemic we observed a 10.3% reduction in call volume and a corresponding reduction in the total number of missions with lights and sirens. We found an increase in on-scene times in both missions with patients conveyed to hospital (20.6 min vs. 18.7 min) and missions with non-conveyed patients (37.4 min versus 30.7 min). The response times were unaffected. CONCLUSION: The increased on-scene times of the ambulances may largely be attributed to time utilised to exert the increased competencies concerning treat-and-release of patients.. Despite an increased on-scene time of the ambulances, we believe that the combination of a reduction in the number of total missions and the existing capacity in the ambulance service in the Region of Southern Denmark nullified the prolongation of ambulance response times that was seen in other countries during the pandemic. This capacity allowed for time spent performing in-depth examinations of patients with the potential to be released at the scene.","output":"Increased ambulance on-scene times but unaffected response times during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Southern Denmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the maternal, fetal and neonatal complications in pregnant women with Covid-19 infection.

METHODS: This study used deidentified administrative claims from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (January 1, 2016-August 31, 2019) to identify patients with a respiratory hospitalization. It compared unadjusted out-of-pocket spending among consumer-directed health plan enrollees with that among traditional plan enrollees using difference of mean significance tests and repeated the analysis separately by age category and calendar year quarter. These data were collected on a rolling basis by OptumLabs and were analyzed in March 2020. RESULTS: Commercially insured consumer-directed health plan enrollees had significantly higher out-of-pocket spending than traditional plan enrollees, and these differences were largest among younger populations. The largest difference in out-of-pocket spending occurred during the first half of the year.
