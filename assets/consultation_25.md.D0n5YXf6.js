Our study is grounded in the assumption that health behavior is activated based on locally relevant perceptions of threats, susceptibility and benefits in engaging in protective behavior, which requires careful attention to how these perceptions might be structured and activated. We assess the validity of the HBM in two European countries that have been relatively understudied, using simultaneous measurements during acute periods of infection in Romania and Italy. An online questionnaire provided a total of (N = 1863) valid answers from both countries. First, to understand individual difference patterns within and across populations, we fit a General Linear Model in which endorsement was predicted by behavior, country, their interaction, and a random effect for participants. Second, we assess the effect of demographics and health beliefs on prevention behaviors by fitting a multi-group path model across countries, in which each behavior was predicted by the observed health belief variables and demographics. Health beliefs showed stronger relationships with the recommended behaviors than demographics. Confirming previously reported relationships, self-efficacy, perceived severity, and perceived benefits were consistently related to the greater adoption of individual behaviors, whereas greater perceived barriers were related to lower adoption of health behaviors. However, we also point to important location specific effects that suggest that local norms shape protective behavior in highly contextualized ways.","output":"Testing the Effectiveness of the Health Belief Model in Predicting Preventive Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Case of Romania and Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a worldwide emergency; therefore, there is a critical need for foundational knowledge about B and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 essential for vaccine development. However, little information is available defining which determinants of SARS-CoV-2 other than the spike glycoprotein are recognized by the host immune system. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein as a suitable candidate target for vaccine formulations. Major B and T cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein are predicted and resulting sequences compared with the homolog immunological domains of other coronaviruses that infect human beings. The most dominant of B cell epitope is located between 176C206 amino acids in the SRGGSQASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS sequence. Further, we identify sequences which are predicted to bind multiple common MHC I and MHC II alleles. Most notably there is a region of potential T cell cross-reactivity within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein position 102C110 amino acids that traverses multiple human alpha and betacoronaviruses. Vaccination strategies designed to target these conserved epitope regions could generate immune responses that are cross-reactive across human coronaviruses, with potential to protect or modulate disease.

Progression to severe disease with multiple organ systems compromise described as Multi Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a rare occurrence believed to be immunologically mediated. Previous reports describe a possible link between children of Latino origin and high incidence of MIS-C in the US. 40% of the total population in Western Massachusetts is of Latino origin. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 30 children admitted to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts from April 2020-June 2021 meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for MIS-C. Demographics, laboratory data, and clinical outcomes including progression to Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) were analyzed. RESULTS: 60% of children were Hispanic. Mean age (9.1 yrs). Range (3m-20 yrs). COVID PCR positive (78%) and COVID Antibody positive (68%). The most common symptom was fever (96.8%) followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (84%). Respiratory symptoms (29%), dermatological manifestations (39%). Most common comorbidity, asthma (19%) followed by obesity (17%). Leukocytosis (47%), lymphopenia (45%), Anemia (55%), thrombocytopenia (20%), high CRP (90%), ferritinemia (57%), acute kidney injury (20%), elevated liver enzymes (53%), 52% children had electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, 34% had abnormal echocardiograms, none displayed coronary artery dilation. Progression to MAS (20%). All patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin G, steroids, aspirin, and anakinra (IL1 receptor antagonist) if progression to MAS. All patients survived. CONCLUSION: In our population, gastrointestinal symptoms were predominant despite a high prevalence of asthma and obesity, previous reports of children with MIS-C describe predominance of respiratory manifestations. We did not encounter any coronary aneurysms during admission. Most children had positive PCR or Antibodies for COVID 19 and showed important abnormalities in multiple cell lines and inflammatory markers. More research is needed to fully understand ethnical risk factors associated with disease severity especially the risk of progression to MAS from MIS-C in children of Latino origin diagnosed with COVID 19 infection.

After autoclaving, the resected bone was reinserted and fixed. The animals were classified into three groups: only AAB reinserted (group 1, control), and AAB and ErhBMP-2 inserted using an ACS (group 2) or FG (group 3) as a carrier. Animals were sacrificed six or 12 weeks after surgery. Specimens were evaluated using radiology and histology. RESULTS Micro-computed tomography images showed the best bony union in group 2 at six and 12 weeks after operation. Quantitative analysis showed all indices except trabecular thickness were the highest in group 2 and the lowest in group 1 at twelve weeks. Histologic results showed the greatest bony union between AAB and radial bone at twelve weeks, indicating the highest degree of engraftment.

The structure of the epigenome consists of covalent modifications of chromatin components, including acetylation by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylation by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Targeting these enzymes with inhibitors to restore epigenetic homeostasis has been explored for many cancers. Osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone malignancy that primarily affects children and young adults, is notable for widespread genetic and epigenetic instability. This may explain why therapy directed at unique molecular pathways has failed to substantially improve outcomes in osteosarcoma over the past four decades. In this review, we discuss the potential of targeting the cancer epigenome, with a focus on histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) for osteosarcoma. We additionally highlight the safety and tolerance of HDACi, combination chemotherapy with HDACi, and the ongoing challenges in the development of these agents.","output":"Targeting the Cancer Epigenome with Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors in Osteosarcoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing spread of COVID-19, it is important to systematically test more and more people.

Such testing strategy may miss out on detecting asymptomatic individuals who got infected via community spread. Thus, it is important to allocate a separate budget of test-kits per day targeted towards preventing community spread and detecting new cases early on.

This process limits the potential for rapid diagnosis and mass analysis, which are necessary to curtail viral spread. In this study, a simple and rapid thermolysis method was developed to circumvent the need for extraction and purification of viral RNA. The developed protocol was applied to one-chip digital PCR (OCdPCR), which allowed thermolysis, RT, and digital PCR in a single unit comprising 20,000 chambers of sub-nanoliter volume. Two viruses such as tobacco mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus were tested as model viral particles. First, the temperature, exposure time, and template concentration were optimized against tobacco mosaic viral particles, and the most efficient conditions were identified as 85C, 5 min, and 0.01 g/nL with a cycle threshold of approximately 33. Finally, the OCdPCR analysis yielded 1,130.2 copies/L using 10(?2) g/nL of viral particles in a 30 min thermolysis-RT reaction at 70C.

This lack of medical attention is especially alarming given their high rate of injury and death. METHODS: Community-based participatory research (CBPR), a relational model that values the participants as equal partners in research, dissemination, and implementation, guided the interviews and mobile clinic. Seafood workers were engaged throughout data collection, analysis, and interpretation and played a significant role in moving the findings from research into actionable change. RESULTS: To address the lack of healthcare options for (im)migrants, and at the request of the seafood workers participating in the ongoing CBPR study, we successfully implemented and treated workers in our mobile clinic. DISCUSSION: Many of these individuals had not been seen by a healthcare provider in years, highlighting the importance of community trust and rapport building when addressing interconnected health and safety issues. CONCLUSIONS: Although CBPR and free (mobile) health clinics are in and of themselves not novel concepts, when applied to high-risk occupational settings with under-reached populations (e.g., (im)migrant workers), they have the ability to improve health and prevent injury.

By the end of 2020, effective vaccines that could prevent the fast spread of the disease started to loom on the horizon. Nevertheless, isolation, social distancing, face masks, and quarantine are the best-known measures, in the time being, to fight the pandemic. On the other hand, contact tracing is an effective procedure in tracking infections and saving others lives. In this paper, we devise a new approach using a hybrid harmony search (HHS) algorithm that casts the problem of finding strongly connected components (SCCs) to contact tracing. This new approach is named as hybrid harmony search contact tracing (HHS-CT) algorithm. The hybridization is achieved by integrating the stochastic hill climbing into the operators' design of the harmony search algorithm. The HHS-CT algorithm is compared to other existing algorithms of finding SCCs in directed graphs, where it showed its superiority over these algorithms.

This study used the effort-reward imbalance model to investigate the association between work-stress characteristics (effort, over-commitment, reward) and mental health problems (anxiety and depression) among front-line public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A total of 4850 valid online questionnaires were collected through a self- constructed sociodemographic questionnaire, the adapted ERI questionnaire, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between ERI factors and mental health problems (i.e., depression and anxiety), with reward treated as a potential moderator in such associations. RESULTS: The data showed that effort and over-commitment were positively associated with depression and anxiety, while reward was negatively associated with depression and anxiety. Development and job acceptance were the two dimensions of reward buffered the harmful effect of effort/over-commitment on depression and anxiety, whereas esteem was non-significant.

The purpose of this paper is to explore how permanent and transitory shocks dominate the common movement between FII flows and the stock market returns. As emerging markets are a major destination of international portfolio investments, the author uses India as a perfect case study to this end.Design/methodology/approachThe paper uses the permanent-transitory as well as a trend-cycle decomposition approach to gain further insights into the common movement between foreign institutional investors (FII) flows and the stock market.FindingsWhen the author identifies innovations based on their degree of persistence, transitory shocks dominate stock returns, whereas permanent shocks explain movements in foreign institutional investors (FII) flows. Also, stock returns have a larger cyclical component compared to cycles in foreign flows. The authors find the sharp downward (upward) movement in the stock market (FII flows) cycle in the initial period of the COIVD-19 pandemic was quickly reversed and currently, the stock market (FII flows) is historically above (below) the long-term trend, hinting at a correction in months ahead. The authors find strikingly similar stock market cycles during the global financial crisis and COVID-19 period.Research limitations/implicationsEvidence suggests the presence of long stock market cycles C substantial and persistent deviations of actual price from its fundamental (trend) value determined by the shared relationship with foreign flows. This refutes the efficient market hypothesis and makes a case favoring diversification gains from investing in India. Further, transitory shocks dominate the forecast error of stock market movements. Thus, the Indian market provides profit opportunities to foreign investors who use a momentum-based strategy. The author also finds support for the positive feedback trading strategy used by foreign investors.Practical implicationsThere is a need for policymakers to account for the foreign undercurrents while formulating economic policies, given the findings that it is the permanent shocks that mostly explain movements in foreign institutional flows. Further, the author finds only stock markets error-correct in response to any short-term shocks to the shared long-term relationship, highlighting the disruptive (though transitory) role of FII flows.Originality/valueUnlike existing studies, the author models the relationship between stock market returns and foreign institutional investors (FII) flows by distinguishing between the permanent and transitory movements in these two variables. Ignoring this distinction, as done in existing literature, can affect the soundness of the estimated parameter that captures the nexus between these two variables. In addition, while it may be common to find that stock market returns and FII flows move together, the paper further contributes by decomposing each variable into a trend and a cycle using this shared relationship. The paper also contributes to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on this relationship.","output":"What do foreign flows tell us about stock market movements in the presence of permanent and transitory shocks?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cellular and humoral response to acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is on focus of research. We evaluate herein the feasibility of expanding virus-specific T cells (VST) against SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo through a standard protocol proven effective for other viruses. The experiment was performed in three different donors' scenarios: (a) SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection/negative serology, (b) SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection/positive serology, and (c) no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection/negative serology. We were able to obtain an expanded VST product from donors 1 and 2 (1.6x and 1.8x increase of baseline VST count, respectively) consisting in CD3 + cells (80.3% and 62.7%, respectively) with CD4 + dominance (60% in both donors). Higher numbers of VST were obtained from the donor 2 as compared to donor 1. T-cell clonality test showed oligoclonal reproducible peaks on a polyclonal background for both donors. In contrast, VST could be neither expanded nor primed in a donor without evidence of prior infection. This proof-of-concept study supports the feasibility of expanding ex vivo SARS-CoV-2-specific VST from blood of convalescent donors. The results raise the question of whether the selection of seropositive donors may be a strategy to obtain cell lines enriched in their SARS-CoV-2-specificity for future adoptive transfer to immunosuppressed patients.","output":"Adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes: A viable strategy for COVID-19 immunosuppressed patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The net level of immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients is difficult to assess.

This study aimed to compare manual suture using the transanal endoscopic operation platform (TEO; Karl Storz, Tttlingen, Germany) with the end-to-end anastomosis hemorrhoid circular stapler (EEA; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) for closure of the rectal viscerotomy during transrectal NOTES segmental colectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 12 swine underwent transrectal hybrid NOTES partial colectomies. Animals were divided into two groups according to the viscerotomy closure technique: 1) TEO manual suture; 2) EEA circular stapler closure. RESULTS Mean ( SD) viscerotomy closure time was 67.5  59.5 minutes and 31.5  19.6 minutes for TEO and EEA, respectively. There was one conversion to laparoscopy in the TEO group and a misfiring in the EEA group that required a TEO salvage suture. There was one positive air-leak test in each group. Peritoneal fluid collected at the end of the procedure tested positive for bacterial contamination in all cases. A mild stenosis was present in 4 /6 viscerotomies (67 %) in the TEO group and in 1/6 (17 %) in the EEA group on endoscopic control. Inflammatory changes were mild in 3/5 (60 %) and 4/5 (80 %) viscerotomies in the TEO and EEA groups, respectively, whereas severe inflammation was found in 2/5 (TEO) and 1 /5 (EEA). CONCLUSION Transrectal viscerotomy closure using the EEA circular stapler technique is feasible, easy to perform, and histologically comparable to suture closure through a TEO platform.

Such a scientific and technological achievement would provide humankind with profound insights into the largest realm of our planet and expand our fundamental understanding of Earth's deep interior and its geodynamic behavior. The formation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges and its subsequent aging over millions of years, leading to subduction, arc volcanism, and recycling of some components into the mantle, comprise the dominant geological cycle of matter and energy on Earth. Although previous scientific ocean drilling has cored some drill holes into old (&gt; 110 Ma) and young (&lt; 20 Ma) ocean crust, our sampling remains relatively shallow (&lt; 2 km into intact crust) and unrepresentative of average oceanic crust. To date, no hole penetrates more than 100 m into intact average-aged oceanic crust that records the long-term history of seawaterCbasalt exchange (60 to 90 Myr). In addition, the nature, extent, and evolution of the deep subseafloor biosphere within oceanic crust remains poorly unknown. To address these fundamentally significant scientific issues, an international workshop Exploring Deep Oceanic Crust off Hawai\`i brought together 106 scientists and engineers from 16 countries that represented the entire spectrum of disciplines, including petrologists, geophysicists, geochemists, microbiologists, geodynamic modelers, and drilling/logging engineers. The aim of the workshop was to develop a full International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) proposal to drill a 2.5 km deep hole into oceanic crust on the North Arch off Hawai\`i with the drilling research vessel Chikyu. This drill hole would provide samples down to cumulate gabbros of mature ( 80 Ma) oceanic crust formed at a half spreading rate of  3.5 cm a-1. A Moho reflection has been observed at  5.5 km below the seafloor at this site, and the workshop concluded that the proposed 2.5 km deep scientific drilling on the North Arch off Hawai\`i would provide an essential pilot hole to inform the design of future mantle drilling.","output":"Workshop report: Exploring deep oceanic crust off Hawai\`i"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concerns of mothers seeking breastfeeding support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the experiences of Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA) volunteers who assisted them, were explored via an online survey.

The typical symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, evolving to a clinical picture of pneumonia and, ultimately, death. Nausea and diarrhea are equally frequent, suggesting viral infection or transmission via the gastrointestinal-enteric system. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is cleaved by transmembrane proteases during host cells infection, thus reducing its activities. ACE2 is a relevant player in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), counterbalancing the deleterious effects of angiotensin II. Furthermore, intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the aminoacid transporter B0AT1. It has been suggested that B0AT1/ACE2 complex in the intestinal epithelium regulates gut microbiota (GM) composition and function, with important repercussions on local and systemic immune responses against pathogenic agents, namely virus. Notably, productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2+ mature human enterocytes and patients' GM dysbiosis was recently demonstrated. This review outlines the evidence linking abnormal ACE2 functions with the poor outcomes (higher disease severity and mortality rate) in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing age-related comorbidities and addresses a possible role for GM dysbiosis.

Clinicians and medical representative bodies such as the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine (IAEM) have expressed concern that some patients may not seek timely urgent medical intervention. Evidence from previous epidemics found that hospital avoidance during outbreaks of MERS and SARS was common. While ED attendance returned to normal following SARS and MERS, both outbreaks lasted 2-3 months. As the COVID-19 pandemic is forecast to extend into 2021, little is known about the impact COVID-19 will have on paediatric attendance at EDs as the pandemic evolves. Aims: This project aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on paediatric emergency healthcare utilisation, to understand how the health seeking behaviour of parents may have altered due to the pandemic, and to identify how any barriers to accessing care can be removed. Methods: Administrative data records from five EDs across Ireland and one Urgent Care Centre will be analysed to identify changes in attendances at emergency healthcare. Qualitative inquiry will be utilised to capture the experience of staff providing emergency healthcare to paediatric patients during COVID-19, and their feedback on identified trends will inform the interpretation of findings. A cross-sectional survey of parents will capture experiences, concerns and decision-making on accessing healthcare for their children during the pandemic. Results and Conclusion: This information will help decision makers respond rapidly to meet the clinical needs of paediatric patients as the circumstances of the pandemic unfold and reduce the disruption to normal paediatric ED services during the onset of COVID-19. As the health of a child can deteriorate more rapidly than that of an adult, any delay in seeking care for an acutely ill child may have serious consequences.","output":"CUPID COVID-19: emergency department attendance by paediatric patients during COVID-19 - project protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To explore the kinetic changes in virology, specific antibody response and imaging during the clinical course of COVID-19. METHODS: This observational study enrolled 20 patients with COVID-19, who were hospitalized between January 20-April 6, 2020, in the two COVID-19 designated hospitals of Zhoushan, Zhejiang and Rushan, Shandong, China, The laboratory findings, imaging, serum response to viral infection, and viral RNA level in the throat and stool samples were assessed from onset to recovery phase in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 RNA was positive as early as day four. It remained positive until day 55 post-onset in the sputum-throat swabs and became negative in most cases (55%) within 14 days after onset. Lymphocytopenia occurred in 40% (8/20) of patients during the peak infection period and returned to normal at week five.

Most of these models, however, predict concentrations of pollutants following a data-driven approach in which the physical laws that govern their behaviors and relationships remain hidden. With the aid of real-world air quality data collected hourly in different stations throughout Madrid, we present an empirical approach using data-driven techniques with the following goals: (1) Find parsimonious systems of ordinary differential equations via sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) that model the concentration of pollutants and their changes over time; (2) assess the performance and limitations of our models using stability analysis; (3) reconstruct the time series of chemical pollutants not measured in certain stations using delay coordinate embedding results. Our results show that Akaike's Information Criterion can work well in conjunction with best subset regression as to find an equilibrium between sparsity and goodness of fit. We also find that, due to the complexity of the chemical system under study, identifying the dynamics of this system over longer periods of time require higher levels of data filtering and smoothing. Stability analysis for the reconstructed ordinary differential equations (ODEs) reveals that more than half of the physically relevant critical points are saddle points, suggesting that the system is unstable even under the idealized assumption that all environmental conditions are constant over time.","output":"Modeling Atmospheric Data and Identifying Dynamics: Temporal Data-Driven Modeling of Air Pollutants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

We compared the preserved lung volume after segmentectomy among the methods using stapler, sharp dissection, and their combination for cutting the intersegmental plane in ex vivo pig lungs. We also examined a covering effect of polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue. METHODS To assume a large regional segmentectomy in clinical practice, segments of the left caudal lobe except the lateral segment 2 (L2 segment) were resected, and the lung volume of the preserved L2 segment was measured. The intersegmental plane was cut by the following three methods: (1) stapler (n = 8); (2) scissors (n = 8); and (3) the combined method, that is, cutting the shallow lung tissue with scissors and the deep one with stapler (n = 8). The opened intersegmental plane was covered with polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue. The air leakage was checked by injecting air through the bronchus at pressures of up to 30 cmH(2)O. Thereafter, normal saline was injected through the bronchus at pressures of 10, 20, and 30 cmH(2)O, to measure lung volumes by the volume-displacement method. RESULTS Polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue prevented air leakage completely at up to 30 cmH(2)O. At the saline injection pressures of 10, 20, and 30 cmH(2)O, the mean volumes of L2 segment were 72  14, 96  14, and 109  26 ml with the stapler; 86  11, 117  19, and 135  39 ml with scissors; and 98  10, 140  20, and 155  40 ml with the combined methods, respectively. The volume of the preserved L2 segment was significantly lower with the stapler method than with either the scissors or combined method at each pressure (p < 0.01). The difference was not significant between the scissors and combined methods. CONCLUSIONS Coverage with polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue prevented air leakage from the opened intersegmental plane.

Yet, to our knowledge, no head\\\\to\\\\head comparison between various magnesium formulations in terms of effects on arterial stiffness has been performed. We assessed the effects of magnesium citrate supplementation on arterial stiffness and blood pressure and explored whether other formulations of magnesium have similar effects. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomized trial, subjects who were overweight and slightly obese received either magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide, magnesium sulfate, or placebo for 24 weeks. The total daily dose of magnesium was 450 mg/d. The primary outcome was carotid\\\\to\\\\femoral pulse wave velocity, which is the gold standard method for measuring arterial stiffness. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure and plasma and urine magnesium. Overall, 164 participants (meanSD age, 63.26.8 years; 104 [63.4%] women) were included. In the intention\\\\to\\\\treat analysis, neither magnesium citrate nor the other formulations had an effect on carotid\\\\to\\\\femoral pulse wave velocity or blood pressure at 24 weeks compared with placebo. Magnesium citrate increased plasma (+0.04 mmol/L; 95% CI, +0.02 to +0.06 mmol/L) and urine magnesium (+3.12 mmol/24 h; 95% CI, +2.23 to +4.01 mmol/24 h) compared with placebo. Effects on plasma magnesium were similar among the magnesium supplementation groups, but magnesium citrate led to a more pronounced increase in 24\\\\hour urinary magnesium excretion than magnesium oxide or magnesium sulfate. One serious adverse event was reported, which was considered unrelated to the study treatment.

The aim of this study was to screen appropriate cutoffs for size of solitary hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. METHODS A cohort of 1760 patients with solitary HBV-related HCC undergoing curative liver resection was divided into 11 groups based on tumor size in 1-cm interval. The minimum p value method was used to screen the appropriate size cutoff according to overall survival (OS). If multiple cutoffs meet the above standard, a univariate analysis will be performed by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and hazard ratio (HR) will be considered as a criterion to assess the difference in survival. RESULTS There are 8 dichotomy, 8 trichotomy, and no inquartation cutoffs that were screened when classifying tumor sizes in accordance with OS. The HR values of tumor size at these trichotomy cutoffs for OS were compared, and the highest HR value is 2.79 when size cutoff is 3/9 cm. Then, we reclassified patients into three new classifications:  3 cm (n = 422), > 3 and  9 cm (n = 1072), and > 9 cm (n = 266). The comparison of clinicopathologic characteristics among these three classifications showed that the increase of tumor size was associated with the increase of -fetoprotein (AFP), microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor differentiation, and liver cirrhosis. And the comparison of the OS among three classifications showed statistical differences.

HT is a multifactorial disease and a public health burden, as it is a risk factor for diseases like stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure, leading to 10.4 million deaths yearly. Blood pressure is regulated by the RAAS. The system consists of two counter-regulatory axes: ACE/ANG-II/AT1 R and ACE2/ANG-(1-7)/MAS. The main regulatory protein in balancing the RAAS is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The protein also functions as the main mediator of endocytosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the host cell. SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19 and has caused a worldwide pandemic; however, the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 are limited. Several drugs and vaccines are currently being tested in clinical trials with a few already approved by EMA and FDA. HT is a major risk factor regarding the severity and fatality of COVID-19, and the RAAS plays an important role in COVID-19 infection since SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a dysregulation of the system by reducing the ACE2 expression.

Less is known about the impact on mental health of their relatives, and potential interventions to support them. METHODS Systematic review and narrative synthesis. OUTCOMES 28 studies were identified, sixteen quantitative and twelve qualitative. One involved health workers' relatives, and the rest covered relatives of directly affected individuals. We found considerable burden of mental ill-health in both groups. Among relatives of healthcare workers, 29.4% reported symptoms consistent with probable anxiety disorder and 33.7% with probable depression. Prevalence rates for probable anxiety disorder ranged from 24-42% and probable depression 17-51% for the relatives of affected people. One study found a 2% prevalence of PTSD and another found odds of PTSS were significantly higher among relatives of affected individuals compared with the general population. Only two intervention studies were identified and both were descriptive in nature. INTERPRETATION Available evidence suggests relatives of people affected by infective outbreaks report mental ill-health. Having a relative who died particularly increased risk. Good outcomes for relatives of affected individuals were promoted by practical and social support, public health guidance that recognises the caring role of relatives, and being supported to see the positives as well as negatives in their situation. Good outcomes for relatives of health workers were promoted by perceived effectiveness of protective equipment. High quality evidence on potential interventions to support relatives is lacking.

The E protein is thought to promote virion assembly, which occurs in the Golgi region of infected cells. It has also been implicated in the release of infectious particles after budding. The E protein has ion channel activity in vitro, although a role for channel activity in infection has not been established. Furthermore, the membrane topology of the E protein is of considerable debate, and the protein may adopt more than one topology during infection. We previously showed that the HD of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein is required for the efficient release of infectious virus, an activity that correlated with disruption of the secretory pathway. Here we report that a single residue within the hydrophobic domain, Thr16, is required for secretory pathway disruption. Substitutions of other residues for Thr16 were not tolerated. Mutations of Thr16 did not impact virus assembly as judged by virus-like particle production, suggesting that alteration of secretory pathway and assembly are independent activities. We also examined how the membrane topology of IBV E affected its function by generating mutant versions that adopted either a transmembrane or membrane hairpin topology. We found that a transmembrane topology was required for disrupting the secretory pathway, but was less efficient for virus-like particle production. The hairpin version of E was unable to disrupt the secretory pathway or produce particles. The findings reported here identify properties of the E protein that are important for its function, and provide insight into how the E protein may perform multiple roles during infection.","output":"A Single Polar Residue and Distinct Membrane Topologies Impact the Function of the Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus E Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structured abstractO_ST_ABSIMPORTANCEC_ST_ABSAdults are being vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, but the longitudinal protection of these vaccines is uncertain, given the ongoing appearance of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Methods to easily test infected children and track the virus they carry are in demand. OBJECTIVETo determine if saliva is an effective sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies in children aged 10 years and under, and associate viral RNA levels to infectivity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSIn this cross-sectional study, saliva SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR tests, with and without RNA extraction, were validated in 49 hospitalized adults. The test was then applied to 85 children, aged 10 years and under, admitted to the hospital regardless of COVID-19 symptomatology. Amongst 85 children, 29 (63.0%) presented at least one COVID-19 symptom, 46 (54.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 28 (32.9%) were under the age of 1 and the mean (SD) age was 3.8 (3.4) years.

Children admitted to hospital for any reason and therefore with unclear onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESSaliva RT-qPCR up to CT<37 accurately identifies SARS-CoV-2 infected children, with viral infectivity in tissue culture restricted to CT<26. RESULTSIn adults, the accuracy of the saliva SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test was 98.0% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 89.3%-100%) as compared to NP-RT-qPCR. In children, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of saliva-RT-qPCR tests compared to NP swab-RT-qPCR were, respectively, 84.8% (71.8%-92.4%), 100% (91.0%-100%), and 91.8% (84.0%- 96.6%) with RNA extraction and 81.8% (68.0%-90.5%), 100% (91.0%-100%), and 90.4% (82.1%-95.0%) without RNA extraction. The threshold for rescuing infectious particles from saliva was CT<26. There were significant IgM positive responses to the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) among children positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab and negative by saliva compared to other groups, indicating late infection onset (>7-10 days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCESaliva-molecular testing is suitable in children aged 10 years and under, including infants aged <1 year, even bypassing RNA extraction methods.

Unlike thermocycling amplification, isothermal amplification, compatible for point-of-care (PoC) tests, cannot be benefited by the heat-activation technique, making the method qualitative rather than quantitative. In this work, we newly developed a lead ion (Pb2+) activation technique, called lead-start isothermal amplification, allowing on-demand activation or deactivation of DNA polymerases at room temperature. We systematically correlated the DNA polymerase inhibition by the TQ30 aptamer with Pb2+-responsive strand cleavage by the GR5 DNAzyme, and relying on the type of interconnectors, Pb2+ successfully served as an initiator or a terminator of isothermal DNA amplification. Our lead-start isothermal amplification was exceptionally Pb2+-specific, dramatically increasing the enzymatic activity of DNA polymerase (>25 times) only by Pb2+ introduction. Despite one-by-one sample preparation, a number of reactions can begin and end at the same time, sharing the identical amplification conditions, and thereby allowing their quantitative analysis and comparison. Using a portable UV lamp and a smartphone camera, we also succeeded in quantifying the amounts of clinically important and human papillomavirus type 16 genes in human serum and SARS-CoV-2's nucleocapsid genes in human serum and saliva, and the limit of detection was as low as 0.1 nM, highly applicable for actual PoC tests in the field with no purification process.","output":"Lead-start isothermal polymerase amplification controlled by DNAzymatic switches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 vaccination may trigger reactive lymphadenopathy, confounding imaging interpretation.

Methods: This retrospective study included 67 patients (mean age 75.69.2 years; 43 men, 24 women) who underwent PET examination (PET/CT in 66, PET/MRI in 1; FDG in 54, 11C-choline in 13) between December 14th 2020 and March 10th 2021 following COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 52, Moderna vaccine in 15) and who had undergone pre-vaccination PET without visible axillary node uptake. PET was performed a median of 13 and 10 days after vaccination in patients who had received one (n = 44) and two (n = 23) doses, respectively. Two nuclear medicine physicians independently reviewed images, blinded to injection laterality and days since vaccination. Lymph node or deltoid SUVmax greater than blood pool SUVmax was considered positive. Interreader agreement was assessed, and the more experienced physician's measurements were used for subsequent analysis. Results: Positive axillary lymph node uptake was observed in 10.4% (7/67) of patients [7.4% (4/54) of FDG examinations, 23.1% (3/13) of 11C-choline examinations]; four and three patients with positive axillary lymph nodes had received Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively. Injection laterality was documented in five of seven patients with positive axillary lymph nodes and was ipsilateral to the positive node in all five patients. PET was performed within 24 days of vaccination in all patients with a positive node. One patient exhibited extra-axillary lymph node uptake (ipsilateral supraclavicular uptake on FDG PET). Ipsilateral deltoid uptake was present in 14.5% (8/55) of patients with documented injection laterality, including in 42.9% (3/7) of patients with positive axillary lymph nodes.

Despite advances in injectable treatments and guidelines, findings highlight the many barriers that still exist and show how strongly held culturally-specific health beliefs of people from diverse socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds can become substantial obstacles to treatment.","output":"Individual, healthcare professional and system-level barriers and facilitators to initiation and adherence to injectable therapies for type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-ethnography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is linked to Kokkotis et al papers.

AMPs are evolutionarily conserved molecules that exhibit structural and functional diversity. They provide a possible solution to the antibiotic-resistance crisis. MAIN TEXT: These small cationic peptides can target bacteria, fungi, and viruses, as well as cancer cells. Their unique action mechanisms, rare antibiotic-resistant variants, broad-spectrum activity, low toxicity, and high specificity encourage pharmaceutical industries to conduct clinical trials to develop them as therapeutic drugs. The rapid development of computer-assisted strategies accelerated the identification of AMPs. The Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD) so far contains 3324 AMPs from different sources. In addition to their applications in different fields, some AMPs demonstrated the potential to combat COVID-19, and hinder viral infectivity in diverse ways. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a brief history of AMPs and their features, including classification, evolution, sources and mechanisms of action, biosynthesis pathway, and identification techniques. Furthermore, their different applications, challenges to clinical applications, and their potential use against COVID-19 are presented.","output":"Antimicrobial peptides: features, applications and the potential use against covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The short-term rental market provides a close to real time signal of how events of regional and national importance can affect the demand for housing.

The hematochemical values of routine blood exams could represent a faster and less expensive alternative. Methods Three different training data set of hematochemical values from 1,624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive), admitted at San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020, were used for developing machine learning (ML) models: the complete OSR dataset (72 features: complete blood count (CBC), biochemical, coagulation, hemogasanalysis and CO-Oxymetry values, age, sex and specific symptoms at triage) and two sub-datasets (COVID-specific and CBC dataset, 32 and 21 features respectively). 58 cases (50% COVID-19 positive) from another hospital, and 54 negative patients collected in 2018 at OSR, were used for internal-external and external validation. Results We developed five ML models: for the complete OSR dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.83 to 0.90; for the COVID-specific dataset from 0.83 to 0.87; and for the CBC dataset from 0.74 to 0.86. The validations also achieved good results: respectively, AUC from 0.75 to 0.78; and specificity from 0.92 to 0.96.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the perceived value of four key FRPs, based on industry experiences in using these pathways. In addition, we sought to characterize the perceived impact based on benefits and barriers as well as suggested solutions for their use and recommendations as identified by companies, to outline how these FRPs may be further evolved as tools for expediting the development and regulatory review of important medicines. METHODS: A study was undertaken to characterize the perceived value and impact of US FDA (i.e., Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track), European Medicines Agency (i.e., PRIME), and Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (i.e., Sakigake) FRPs through a comprehensive analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) as well as suggested solutions based on industry experiences with their use. The finalized survey comprised six questions and was sent to senior management in regulatory affairs departments at 22 multinational pharmaceutical companies in March 2019, with a deadline for completion by April 2019. The responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. SWOT and free-text responses were reviewed and manually grouped into key themes according to high concordance. RESULTS: Survey results were returned by 11 pharmaceutical companies. Based on their perceived value and positive impact, the evaluated FRPs seem to be generally recognized as helpful tools for ensuring timely development and review of important medicines while ensuring multistakeholder involvement. Respondents overwhelmingly felt that the Breakthrough Therapy Designation carried a positive influence, both within and outside their organizations. Following closely with a positive although varied perception was Sakigake, but respondents exhibited more ambivalence about Fast Track and PRIME. Companies felt the impact of the FRPs was generally positive for most stakeholders except for health technology assessors/payers, highlighting the need to better align FRPs with flexible access and reimbursement pathways to expedite the equitable availability of high\\\\quality, safe, effective medicines.

It remained unclear if telemedicine visits actually achieved first contact resolution (FCR), fully meeting the patients needs through their virtual care experience. At a time when Florida ranked #3 in its COVID-19 census, Veterans needed access to timely care to answer their concerns and questions. This is even more important as Veterans tend to have multiple comorbidities, translating into increased risk of morbidity and mortality with COVID-19. VISN 8, a region of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) that covers most of Florida, South Georgia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, established a Clinical Contact Center (CCC) in July 2019. The CCC is a 24/7 virtual urgent care organization providing episodic care via telephone and video with physicians and nurse practitioners who work 7 days a week from 7A to 11:30P. A physician was available overnight for COVID-19-related concerns. This study examined the change in CCC workload as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed first contact resolution (FCR) for patients with COVID-19 related chief complaints. Methods: This was a retrospective study centered around March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic. This analysis included a sample size of 6,660 patient episodes between March - August 2020. Our outcome variable of interest was FCR. We constructed a binary disposition variable of stay at home or other which included presentation to the ED or PC. Data collected included patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, COVID-19-related chief complaints, and visit modality (phone versus video). We used a logistic regression to examine factors affecting the probability that patients remained at home. A VA IRB determined that the study was exempt from review. Results: Figure 1 displays the increase in CCC workload during the pandemic starting in March 2020 with a sustained ability to achieve FCR. During the pandemic, patients with suspected COVID-19 were 2.75 times more likely to stay at home than patients calling with non-COVID-19 related chief complaints. This suggests that telemedicine offers significant public health value to patients who are not presenting to the ED or for PC visits potentially exposing themselves and others to the spread of the virus. The control variables of sex and visit modality were found to not be statistically significant. Conclusion: This study established the value of telemedicine in a pandemic with FCR and avoidance of public spaces that could potentially lead to a COVID-19 infection. The service provided by the CCC was invaluable to Veterans as they sought out timely care.

Here, we used all-atom classical Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the stability of the reference interface for three complexes that previously served as targets in the CAPRI competition. For each one of these targets, we also ran MD simulations for ten models that are distributed over the High, Medium and Acceptable accuracy categories. To assess the quality of these models from a dynamic perspective, we set up new criteria which take into account the stability of the reference experimental protein interface. We show that, when the protein interfaces are allowed to evolve along time, the original ranking based on the static CAPRI criteria no longer holds as over 50% of the docking models undergo a category change (which can be either toward a better or a lower accuracy group) when reassessing their quality using dynamic information.

Data across the 6-month period were compared between those under lockdown versus those not under such restrictions. RESULTS: BPAQ Total Aggression scores showed a significant main effect for both month and lockdown status as well as a significant interaction effect, with increasing scores evident for those reporting that they were under lockdown relative to those reporting no restrictions. This same pattern was evident for all four subscales of the BPAQ, including Physical Aggression, Verbal Aggression, Anger, and Hostility. LIMITATIONS: Random sampling of the entire population was not possible, so generalization of the results should be made with caution. Additionally, data were collected cross-sectionally and cannot be considered to reflect longitudinal change within individuals.

Laparoscopic ileostomy reversal (LIR) with lysis of adhesions has potential benefits over conventional open surgery. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of laparoscopic and open ileostomy reversal. METHODS 133 consecutive patients undergoing ileostomy reversal at our institution between June 2009 and August 2013 were analyzed using a retrospective database. The group comprised 53 laparoscopic cases and 80 open cases, performed by four surgeons at a single center. The data were analyzed for patient demographics, operative characteristics, postoperative outcomes, and 30-day morbidity and mortality. RESULTS The two groups had comparable mean age, gender distribution, ASA scores, and BMI. The laparoscopic group had a significantly longer duration of surgery compared to the open reversal group (109 versus 93 min, p < 0.05). However, this group underwent more lysis of adhesions (60.4 % versus 26.3 %, p < 0.01) as well as concurrent stoma site mesh reinforcement (32.1 % versus 6.3 %, p < 0.01). In the laparoscopy group, 20.7 % of patients underwent intra-corporeal ileo-ileal anastomosis. There were no significant differences between the laparoscopic and open groups with regard to estimated blood loss (31 versus 40 ml, respectively) or mean length of stay (5.3 vs. 5.7 days, respectively). The rates of overall 30-day morbidity (16.9 % for laparoscopic vs. 21.3 % for open) as well as rates of specific complications were equivalent between groups. 30-day mortalities were not noted in either group.

Upon any detection of invading pathogen products (e.g., TLR agonists) or host-released signaling factors (e.g., interferon/IFN), these cells undergo an activation process to release large numbers of inflammatory substances that participate in inflammation and homeostasis. The profound effects of inflammation associated with TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod (R848) and type 1 interferon (e.g., IFN-)-induced macrophage and dendritic cell activation on biological outcomes have long been recognized. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined in microglial cells. METHODS: The present study investigated the molecular signatures of microglia and identified genes that are uniquely or synergistically expressed in R848-, IFN-- or R848 with IFN--treated primary microglial (PM) cells. We used RNA-sequencing, quantitative real-time PCR, and bioinformatics approaches to derive regulatory networks that control the transcriptional response of PM to R848, IFN- and R848 with IFN-. RESULTS: Our approach revealed that the inflammatory response in R848 with IFN--treated PM is faster and more intense than that in R848 or IFN--treated PM in terms of the number of differentially expressed genes and the magnitude of induction/repression. In particular, our integrative analysis enabled us to suggest the regulatory functions of TFs, which allowed the construction of a network model that explains how TLR7/8 and IFN--sensing pathways achieve specificity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the systematic approach presented herein could be important to the understanding microglial activation-mediated molecular signatures induced by inflammatory stimuli related to TLR7/8, IFN- or co-signaling, and associated transcriptional machinery of microglial functions and neuroinflammatory mechanisms.

Vaccinations aim to stimulate these responses against pathogens. Several studies have evaluated the impact of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies on immune response to vaccines. Findings from these studies have important implications for people with multiple sclerosis who require vaccination and are using disease-modifying therapies. METHODS: : Searches using PubMed and other engines were conducted in May 2020 to collect studies evaluating the impact of various disease-modifying therapies on immune responses to vaccination. RESULTS: : Several studies demonstrated preserved immune responses in people treated with beta-interferons to multiple vaccine types. Limited data suggest vaccine responses to be preserved with dimethyl fumarate treatment, as well. Vaccine responses were reduced to varying degrees in those treated with glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, and natalizumab. The timing of vaccination played an important role in those treated with alemtuzumab. Humoral vaccine responses were significantly impaired by B cell depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapies, particularly to a neoantigen. Data are lacking on vaccine responses in patients with multiple sclerosis taking cladribine and high-dose corticosteroids. Notably, the majority of these studies have focused on humoral responses, with few examining cellular immune responses to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: : Prior investigations into the effects of individual disease-modifying therapies on immune responses to existing vaccines can serve as a guide to expected responses to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Responses to any vaccination depend on the vaccine type, the type of response (recall versus response to a novel antigen), and the impact of the individual disease-modifying therapy on humoral and cellular immunity in response to that vaccine type. When considering a given therapy, clinicians should weigh its efficacy against MS for the individual patient versus potential impact on responses to vaccinations that may be needed in the future.","output":"Effects of MS disease-modifying therapies on responses to vaccinations: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Access to child care centers reduces the care burden of parents, promotes child development, and creates employment opportunities. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, however, many child care centers closed or reduced capacity because of restrictions and declining demand for in-person care. The authors use anonymized and aggregated mobile phone data to track year-over-year changes in visits to child care centers across most counties in the United States during each month of the pandemic. The findings reveal that two-thirds of child care centers closed in April 2020, while one-third remained closed in April 2021. Moreover, non-White families are more likely to be exposed to child care closures than White families.

Methods & Materials Data on age-specific case incidence of SARS-CoV-2 derived from publicly available databases from selected countries in Europe, North America, Australasia, and Asia were collected and analysed to identify and evaluate trends in reported age specific distribution of morbidity from SARS-CoV-2 in countries for which data was available. Results Data for laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases from South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the Netherlands exhibited essentially identical profiles, with a bimodal distribution that shows highest rate of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals in the 20-29 years age cohort (21%-27% of total), and a second lower peak for the 50-59 or 60-69 age cohorts (16-18% of total), while preliminary data from China, United States and Sweden exhibited a unimodal distribution with highest rate of positive individuals for the 50-59 age cohort. Conclusion There is increasing evidence that individuals < 30 years of age may be playing a highly significant role in the facilitation and amplification of COVID-19 transmission in countries worldwide. Data reported from the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in at least 5 countries (South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Netherlands) demonstrated that greater attention should be paid to the frequency and epidemiological importance of COVID-19 infections among young adults in the 20-29 year age cohort, because individuals in this age range comprise a large proportion (21%-27%) of the known laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases in these countries, and perhaps other countries for which reliable data are not yet available. The epidemiological importance of COVID-19 infections among young adults and adolescents in amplifying and facilitating the proliferation of the COVID-19 Pandemic has been systematically underestimated in many countries, because of low rates of testing among asymptomatic individuals and low rates of severe disease or mortality among individuals <30 years of age. Clarifying and understanding the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among individuals in younger age cohorts will help in determining control strategies at the individual and population levels.","output":"COVID-19 Transmission Under the Public Health Radar: High Prevalence in Young Adults for COVID-19 Pandemic Wave 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil is a country with marked social asymmetries, which have an impact on the impoverishment of basic educational proficiencies We present a snapshot in a cross-sectional documentary study that registered the risk of distorting educational processes even more intensely, due to the easing of political and pedagogical decision-making Planning and thinking about how to keep our teachers and students learning during the isolation and the post-pandemic period, implies the redesigning of education scenarios, searching for balance in teaching and in the use of technologies and resources Until now, we have noticed an enlarged reproduction of pre-existing educational asymmetries People who live in a situation of social vulnerability and digital exclusion are facing many more difficulties in the isolation period, as well as in managing to keep learning, than those in better financial conditions and with broadband internet access It is a time that requires collective reinvention, bringing together policies and practices in a resolutive and equitable way","output":"Social distancing effects on the teaching systems and teacher education programmes in Brazil: reinventing without distorting teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In light of the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, this study aims to examine the relationship between the availability of public health resources and the mortality rate of this disease.

This study uses GT to analyze the United States (US) general population interest in LT as COVD-19/ARDS salvage therapy. Methods GT was used to access data searched for the term lung transplant. The gathered information included data from January 2016 through October 2021 within US territories. Search frequency, time intervals, sub-regions, frequent topics of interest, and related searches were analyzed. Data was reported as search frequency on means, and a value of 100 represented overall peak popularity. Results The number of Google searches related to the term lung transplant has remained steady interest over time and surged in congruence with the appearance of COVID-19 in the US. From January 2016 until February 2019, interest has ranged from 29 to 58% (average 40%).

METHODS: We used data from the IQVIA Total Patient Tracker to estimate the monthly number of patients dispensed antibiotic prescriptions from retail pharmacies in January 2017-May 2020. We averaged estimates from 2017-2019 and defined expected seasonal change as the average percent change from January to May 2017-2019. We calculated percentage point and volume changes in the number of patients dispensed antibiotics from January to May 2020 exceeding expected seasonal changes. We also calculated average percent change in number of patients dispensed antibiotics per month in 2017- 2019 versus 2020. Data were analyzed overall and by agent, class, patient age, state, and prescriber specialty. RESULTS: From January to May 2020, the number of patients dispensed antibiotic prescriptions decreased from 20.3 to 9.9 million, exceeding seasonally expected decreases by 33 percentage points and 6.6 million patients. The largest changes in 2017-2019 versus 2020 were observed in April (-39%) and May (-42%). The number of patients dispensed azithromycin increased from February to March 2020 then decreased. Overall, beyond-expected decreases were greatest among children (&#8804;19 years) and agents used for respiratory infections, dentistry, and surgical prophylaxis.

The impact of the pandemic on HIV primary care in a Boston community health center (CHC) that has specialized HIV, sexual and gender minority care is analyzed here. METHODS: The CHC has used the Centricity Practice Solution(TM) electronic medical record (EMR) system since 1997. The current analyses used data abstracted from the EMR, testing for significant differences in HIV care utilization using the Student t-test for means and chi-square tests for proportions. RESULTS: There were 2,016 HIV+ patients among 25,606 patients (7.9%) engaged in primary care in 2019. In 2019, HIV+ patients had between 563 and 689 in-person visits per month. On average, monthly visits for HIV care increased (p< 0.0001) in the first two months of 2020 (mean=626, sd=60.1) compared to 2019 (mean=617, sd=40.6), but dropped to 370 and 36 in person visits by HIV+ patients in March and April 2020 respectively (mean=203, sd=236.2; p< 0.0001), when statewide stay-at-home policies were recommended. There were 263 telemedicine visits by HIV+ patients in March and 751 in April, 2020. When telemedicine and in-person visits were combined, mean number of visits per month by HIV+ patients were higher compared to the same two-month period in 2019 (p< .0001). The mean number of plasma HIV RNA viral load (VL) tests performed each month was 279 in 2019 (range 257C312, sd=18.3), versus 219 in March and 274 in April 2020 (mean=246.5, sd=38.9; p< 0.0001).

Setting and Methodology: The authors explore the approaches of different universities worldwide, as well as the extant literature on the topic. An examination of the current literature related explicitly to the COVID-19 online assessments reveals a dearth of engagement by researchers in the South African context. In order to address this lacuna, the authors rely on data generated from an institutional forum on academic dishonesty at a University in South Africa. It focuses specifically on the voices of students presented during the forum, which explained both why students are dishonest and ways to curb dishonesty. Results and Conclusion: The data generated show whilst some students were dishonest due to pandemic-related issues (like lack of monitoring), there are also other reasons, such as lack of time management, feeling overwhelmed and stressed and struggling with technology that contributes to student dishonesty. Students suggest that assessments be approached differently online to curb academic dishonesty.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which the addition of this structured bench-top simulation improves ES knowledge across multiple surgical training programs. METHODS Trainees from 11 residency programs in Canada, the USA and UK participated in a 1-h didactic ES course, based on SAGES' Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy? (FUSE) curriculum. They were then randomized to one of two groups: an unstructured hands-on session where trainees used ES devices (control group) or a goal-directed hands-on training session (Sim group). Pre- and post-curriculum (immediately and 3 months after) knowledge of the safe use of ES was assessed using separate examinations. Data are expressed as mean (SD) and N (%), *p < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 289 (145 control; 144 Sim) trainees participated, with 186 (96 control; 90 Sim) completing the 3-month assessment. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups.

The expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) subunit p65, nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha (IB), inducible nitrite oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), Nrf-2, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), and heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were detected by Western blot. Tail flick, hot plate, orofacial formalin, and photophobia tests were used to evaluate migraine-like pain and migraine-related light sensitivity. Moreover, we evaluate Nrf-2-dependent mechanism by the in vitro stimulation of cells extracted by trigeminal ganglia with diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide (DETA/NO), a nitric oxide (NO) donor. The cells were pre-treated with DMF and an antagonist of Nrf-2, trigonelline (TR) 2 h before DETA/NO stimulation. RESULTS: DMF treatment notably reduced histological damage as showed by cresyl violet staining; also, regulating both NF-B and Nrf-2 pathway, DMF treatment decreased the severity of inflammation and increased the protective antioxidant action. Moreover, the headache was significantly reduced. The protective effect of DMF treatment, via Nrf-2, was confirmed in in vitro studies, through inhibition of Nrf-2 by trigonelline. Cytotoxicity, iNOS, and MnSOD expression were evaluated. CONCLUSION: These results provided the evidence that DMF, by Nrf-2 modulation, has a protective effect on central sensitization induced by NTG, suggesting a new insight into the potential application of DMF as novel candidates in drug development for migraine.","output":"Dimethyl fumarate alleviates the nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced migraine in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 crisis, millions of migrants around the world face food insecurity This could force migrants to travel during the pandemic, exposing them t","output":"Food Security and Human Mobility During the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant impact on healthcare systems worldwide.

Seventy-two participants received sham, 1-mA, and 2-mA tRNS in a double-blind, crossover manner while they performed a sustained-attention task. Receiving 1-mA tRNS was associated with improved sustained attention, whereas the effect of 2-mA tRNS was similar to the effect of sham tRNS. Furthermore, individuals' baseline theta:beta ratio moderated the effects of 1-mA tRNS and provided explanatory power beyond baseline behavioral performance. The tRNS-related effects on sustained attention were also accompanied by reductions in theta:beta ratio. These findings impart novel insights into mechanisms underlying tRNS effects and emphasize how designing studies that link variability in cognitive outcomes to variability in neurophysiology can improve inferential power in neurocognitive research.","output":"Suboptimal Engagement of High-Level Cortical Regions Predicts Random-Noise-Related Gains in Sustained Attention."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The new evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by its high capacity to transmit.

This study aimed to determine the characteristics and known risk factors for contagion and severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 disease in health-care personnel of a pediatric coronavirus disease (COVID) center in Mexico City. METHODS In the last week of March 2020 (at the beginning of phase 2 of the Ministry of Health's national campaign in Mexico), a study was conducted on healthcare workers of a pediatric COVID hospital in Mexico City. Using a virtual interview, we evaluated comorbidities, mobility, areas and functions where they carry out the activities, protection measures, contact history, and vaccination. According to their activities, healthcare workers were classified into the following areas: medical, nursing, other health-care personnel (researchers, nutritionists, rehabilitation, imaging, and laboratory), administrative, and other services. We compared the variables between the groups of healthcare workers with the X2 test. RESULTS We included 812 participants. The mean age was 41  11 years, and 33% were overweight or obese, 18% were over 60 years old, and 19% had high blood pressure.

The expression of HERVs has always been a cause for concern because of its association with various cancers and diseases. However, few previous studies have focused on specific activation of HERVs by viral infections. Our previous study has shown that dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) infection induces the transcription of a large number of abnormal HERVs loci; therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between exogenous viral infection and HERV activation further. In this study, we retrieved and reanalyzed published data on 21 transcriptomes of human cells infected with various viruses. We found that infection with different viruses could induce transcriptional activation of HERV loci. Through the comparative analysis of all viral datasets, we identified 43 key HERV loci that were up-regulated by DENV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, Zika virus, measles virus, and West Nile virus infections. Furthermore, the neighboring genes of these HERVs were simultaneously up-regulated, and almost all such neighboring genes were interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are enriched in the hosts antiviral immune response pathways. Our data supported the hypothesis that activation of HERVs, probably via an interferon-mediated mechanism, plays an important role in innate immunity against viral infections.

One possible explanation for this is that the pandemic has been stressful, and males, more so than females, tend to respond to stress by altering their focus on immediate versus delayed rewards, as reflected in their delay discounting rates. Delay discounting rates from healthy undergraduate students were collected twice during the pandemic. Discounting rates of males (n=190) but not of females (n=493) increased during the pandemic. Using machine learning, we show that prepandemic functional connectome predict increased discounting rates in males (n=88). Moreover, considering that delay discounting is associated with multiple psychiatric disorders, we found the same neural pattern that predicted increased discounting rates in this study, in secondary datasets of patients with major depression and schizophrenia. The findings point to sex-based differences in maladaptive delay discounting under real-world stress events, and to connectome-based neuromarkers of such effects. They can explain why there was a population-level increase in several impulsive and risky behaviors during the pandemic and point to intriguing questions about the shared underlying mechanisms of stress responses, psychiatric disorders and delay discounting.","output":"Maladaptive Changes in Delay Discounting in Males during the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Predictive Role Of Functional Connectome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With population shifts, increased travel, and climate change, the spread of emerging and re-emerging infections is increasing.

Environmental perception is very important to realize intelligent and unmanned coal mine production and operation and to reduce the accident rate of gas explosion and other disasters. The identification of geometric features of the coal mine working face is the main part of the environmental perception of the working face. In this study, we identify geometric features in a large-scale coal mine working face point cloud (we take the ball as an example) so as to provide a method for the environmental perception of the coal mine working face. On the basis of previous research, we upgrade the dynamic graph convolution neural network (DGCNN) for directly processing point clouds from two aspects: extracting local features and global features of point clouds. First, a multiscale dynamic graph convolution neural network (MS-DGCNN) is proposed, and the combination of max-pooling and average-pooling is used as the symmetry function. Second, we use MS-DGCNN to learn the features of a variety of geometric point clouds in the point cloud data set we make and then look for the ball in the large-scale point cloud of the coal mining working face. Finally, we compare the performance of MS-DGCNN with that of other deep neural networks directly processing point clouds. This study enables MS-DGCNN to obtain more powerful feature expression ability and enhance the generalization of the model. In addition, this study provides a solid foundation for the geometric feature identification of MS-DGCNN in the environmental perception of the coal mine working face and creates a precedent for the application of MS-DGCNN in the field of energy.

We hypothesized that an examination of the academic literature would reveal opportunities for an improved approach to research in these settings. METHODS We performed a scoping literature review using search terms related to the occupational and environmental health of workers in correctional environments, limited to studies performed in the United States. RESULTS A total of 942 studies underwent title and abstract screening, 342 underwent full-text review, and 147 underwent data extraction by a single reviewer. The results revealed a body of literature that tends strongly toward analyses of stress and burnout of correctional staff, largely based on self-reported data from cross-sectional surveys. Those studies related to physical health were predominantly represented by topics of infectious disease. There were few or no studies examining exposures or outcomes related to diagnosable mental health conditions, musculoskeletal injury, environmental hazards, medical or mental health staff, immigration detention settings, or regarding incarcerated workers.

By 8 July 2020, the cumulative number of infected people worldwide had exceeded 11.50 million. It has been reported that a variety of indicators, including lymphocytes, can predict the progression of COVID-19 disease, but the clinical application value of eosinophils has not received widespread attention. Its specific changes in the course of the disease, as well as the relationship with severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients, need to be further studied.Method: In this multicenter, retrospective study, we collected data on laboratory-confirmed 482 COVID-19 patients from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, who died or were discharged between February 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. By collecting the clinical data and laboratory examination results of the patients, we analyzed the changes of eosinophil and lymphocyte count in patients with different severity and outcomes, so as to study their relationship with the severity and prognosis, to compare the diagnostic effects of lymphocytes and eosinophils on severe COVID-2019 patients.Result: A total of 482 patients were enrolled in this study. Of those, 39.0% were severe patients and 13.3% were nonsurvivors. All the nonsurvivors were from the severe group. The count of eosinophil remained relatively lower levels during hospitalization in the severe and nonsurvival groups compared with the nonsevere and survival groups (all P < 0.05). Patients with the lowest eosinophil count during hospitalization reduced to 0.0210?/L and =0.0010?/L had higher rates of severity and fatality (all P < 0.05). The lowest counts of lymphocyte and eosinophil during hospitalization were used to analyze the diagnostic efficacy of severe COVID-19, and their diagnostic effects were similar. The cutoff values were 0.7210?/L and =0.0010?/L, and the areas under the curve were 0.768 and 0.740, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression model showed that the older age, the emergence of dyspnea, the increase of the white blood cell count on admission, the decrease of lymphocyte count on admission, and eosinophil count reduced to =0.0010?/L on admission were associated with fatal outcome.Conclusion: Eosinophil and lymphocyte count remained relatively lower levels during hospitalization in the severe and nonsurvival COVID-19 patients, and patients with eosinophil decline had higher rates of severity and fatality. Eosinophils = 0.0010?/L and lymphocytes 0.7210?/L had the similar efficacy to diagnosis the severe COVID-19 patients.

RESULTS: There were differences in ferritin (p = 0.003), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p < 0.001) and lymphopenia (p = 0.033) across all groups, with the most favourable biochemical profile in Group 1, and the least in Group 4. Symptomatic groups (Groups 2 and 4) had higher ICU admissions (1.9% and 6.0%, respectively, p = 0.003) than asymptomatic groups (Groups 1 and 3). Composite end-point was highest in Group 4 (24.0%), followed by Group 3 (8.6%), Group 2 (4.8%) and Group 1 (2.4%) (p < 0.001). The presence of fever (OR 4.096, 95% CI 1.737-9.656, p = 0.001) was associated with the composite end-point after adjusting for age, pulse rate, comorbidities, lymphocyte, ferritin, CRP. Presence of symptoms was not associated with the composite end-point. CONCLUSION: In this COVID-19 cohort, presence of fever was a predictor of adverse outcomes. This has implications on the management of febrile but asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.","output":"Fever as a predictor of adverse outcomes in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is associated with higher mortality and a worse prognosis Nevertheless, most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, and about 5% can develop more severe symptoms and involve hypovolemia and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome In a pathophysiological perspective, severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by numerous dependent pathways triggered by hypercytokinemia, especially IL-6 and TNF-alpha, leading to systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and multiple organ dysfunction Systemic endotheliitis and direct viral tropism to proximal renal tubular cells and podocytes are important pathophysiological mechanisms leading to kidney injury in patients with more critical infection, with a clinical presentation ranging from proteinuria and/or glomerular hematuria to fulminant AKI requiring renal replacement therapies Glomerulonephritis, rhabdomyolysis, and nephrotoxic drugs are also associated with kidney damage in patients with COVID-19 Thus, AKI and proteinuria are independent risk factors for mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection We provide a comprehensive review of the literature emphasizing the impact of acute kidney involvement in the evolutive prognosis and mortality of patients with COVID-19","output":"A review of Covid-19 and acute kidney injury: from pathophysiology to clinical results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia ocasionada por la Covid-19, demostr una vez ms la fragilidad de los Estados Latinoamericanos para implementar un modelo econmico y poltico que garantice los derechos fundamentales de la sociedad Por el contrario, la economa del narcotrfico ha reafirmado su capacidad de adaptacin a esta crisis sanitaria Como consecuencia, los lderes o \\"capos\\" del mundo \\"narco\\" han logrado reafirmarse como una estructura que ejerce violencia indiscriminada para garantizar el xito de los mercados ilegales, pero que es legitimada por un grueso sector de la ciudadana, en la medida que est es compensado con un estilo asistencialista y un discurso populista que predica la necesidad de asumir los riesgos de este modelo, ante la incapacidad del Estado para garantizar economas legales en tiempos de restricciones y confinamientos Como respuesta a este fenmeno, las instituciones estatales, insisten en la moralizacin del fenmeno y en ignorar -en otros casos prefieren la convivencia silenciosa-, los mercados globales, los procesos logisticos y la red de complicidades que asumen el riesgo del negocio, pero tambin sus lucrativas ganancias para la sobrevivencia en tiempos de coronavirus Alternate abstract:The pandemic caused by the Covid-19, once again demonstrated the fragility of Latin American States to implement an economic and political model that guarantees the fundamental rights of society On the contrary the drug trafficking economy has reaffirmed its capacity to adapt to this health crisis As a result, the leaders or \\"capos\\" of the \\"narco\\" world have managed to reassert themselves as a structure that exercises indiscriminate violence to guarantee the success of illegal markets, but which is legitimized by a large sector of citizenship, to the extent that it is compensated with an assistive style and a populist discourse that preaches the need to take the risks of this model, at the inability of the State to guarantee legal economies in times of restrictions and confinement In response to this phenomenon, the state institutions insist on the moralization of the phenomenon and ignoring -

Methods: This is a single center, retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed acute PE admitted in Intensive Cardiac Care Unit of a tertiary level university hospital between January and December 2020. Detailed history, risk factors, laboratory parameters and treatment strategy based on patient risk were assessed. All patients underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography, lower limb venous Doppler and CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). sPESI score and intra-hospital outcomes were evaluated in all patients. Nasopharyngeal smear and realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed in order to confirm COVID-19 infection. Results: We studied 47 patients with acute PE treated in our ICU, with mean age 58.6  19.4 years. Eight patients (17%) had massive PE (central thrombus) and 39 (83%) had sub massive PE (subsegmental thrombus) confirmed by CTPA. Six patients (12,7%) had history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 3 patients (6,3%) had history of prior PE, 4 patients (8,5%) were operated within 3 months, 7 patients (14,8%) had history of malignancy, 24 patient's had increased body weight and obesity (51%). Twelve patients (25,5%) were tested for COVID 19 with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and 3 come positive (12.5%). Eight patients were high risk with shock (17%), intermediate high risk were 29 patients (61.7%) and intermediate low risk were 10 patients (21.3%). sPESI score was >1 in all 47 patients. Abnormal RV function with PAH was found in 32 patients (68%). Five high risk, unstable patients died within 72 hours of admission, resulting in an overall ICU mortality rate of 10,6% and 62.5% mortality rate in patients with cardiogenic shock. Patients with PE and COVID-19 had significantly higher D-dimer and hs-Troponin I levels comparing to the patients with patients negative for COVID-19. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed thrombolytic therapy OR 2.145 (95% CI: 1.105-4,512), D-Dimers >4.500 ng/ml OR 1.893 (95% CI: 0.932-3.241), high risk PE OR 3.98 (95% CI: 1.396-5.641) and acute renal failure OR 2.421 (95% CI: 1.105-4.762) as independent mortality predictors. Eight patients have been treated with fibrinolysis (t-PA), and 39 patients with Heparin therapy. 40 survived patients were discharged with NOAC treatment (95,2%). Conclusions: Pulmonary embolism cardiology clinic ICU admission in the period of COVID-19 pandemic decreased, with increase of PE severity, patients risk and mortality rate. Thrombolytic therapy, D-Dimers >4.500 ng/ml, high risk PE and acute renal failure were independent mortality predictors.

The objective was to evaluate if children with brain-based disabilities are more likely to (1) develop COVID-19, (2) develop complications from the disease, and (3) to have a poorer prognosis. Study design: We conducted a rapid review using search strategies iteratively developed and tested by an experienced medical information specialist in consultation with the review team and a panel of knowledge users. Searches were initially performed on April 18th, 2021, and updated on October 31st, 2020. Four reviewers individually performed study selection using pilot-tested standardized forms. Single reviewers extracted the data using a standardized extraction form that included study characteristics, patients' characteristics, and outcomes reported. Results: We identified 1448 publications, of which 29 were included. Studies reported data on 2288 COVID-19 positive children, including 462 with a brain-based disability, and 72 at risk of developing such disability. Overall, the included studies showed a greater risk to develop severe COVID-19 disease in children with brain-based disabilities. Although mortality is very low, the case-fatality rate appeared to be higher in children with disabilities compared to children without disabilities.

No studies have compared the clinical efficacy of different mAbs against Omicron VOC. MethodsThe MANTICO trial is a non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical efficacy of bamlanivimab/etesevimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, and sotrovimab in outpatients aged 50 or older with early COVID-19. As the patient enrolment was interrupted for possible futility after the onset of the Omicron wave, the analysis was performed according to the SARS-CoV-2 VOC. The primary outcome was COVID-19 progression (hospitalisation, need of supplemental oxygen therapy, or death through day 14). Secondary outcomes included the time to symptom resolution, assessed using the product-limit method. Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard model were used to assess the association with predictors. Log rank test was used to compare survival functions. ResultsOverall, 319 patients were included. Among 141 patients infected with Delta, no disease progression was recorded and the time to symptom resolution did not differ significantly between treatment groups (Log-rank Chi-square 0.22, p 0.895). Among 170 patients infected with Omicron (80.6% BA.1, 19.4% BA.1.1), two disease progressions were recorded in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group and the median time to symptom resolution was 5 days shorter in the sotrovimab group compared to bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab (HR 0.526 and HR 0.451, 95% CI 0.359 - 0.77 and 95% CI 0.303 - 0.669, p 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively). ConclusionsThese results confirm the in-vitro data of superiority of sotrovimab versus casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab/etesivamab in reducing the time to recovery in patients infected with Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1, while no difference was detected in Delta infections. Casirivimab/imdevimab seems to maintain a role in preventing severe COVID-19 in the Omicron population.

Based on the actual inputCoutput situation of ecological land utilisation, we constructed an index system in the Yangtze Delta to measure the ecological land utilisation efficiency with a Slack-Based Model (SBM) in the data envelopment analysis (DEA).

Both the technical efficiency and scale efficiency increased over the research period. The technical efficiencies in most cities were efficient and equal to the scale efficiencies. Among the remaining cities, the technical efficiencies and scale efficiencies were inefficient and not synchronous. In addition, we found that the that poor efficiencies of some cities can mainly be attributed to low-technology, an unsuited-scale, or a combination of these.

Methods MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were searched from database inception to July 16, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies (PCS) evaluating different frequencies of routine follow-up. Citations were assessed by pairs of independent reviewers. Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for Cohort Studies. Findings were summarized narratively. Results The literature search identified 3,316 studies, of which 7 (6 RCTs and 1 PCS) were eligible.

Susceptibility to accumulation of multiple NCDs is rooted in social, economic and cultural contexts, with important differences in the burden, patterns, and determinants of multimorbidity across settings. Despite high prevalence of individual NCDs within the Caribbean region, exploration of the social epidemiology of multimorbidity remains sparse. This study aimed to examine the social determinants of NCD multimorbidity in Jamaica, to better inform prevention and intervention strategies. METHODS: Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to examine social determinants of identified multimorbidity patterns in a sample of 2551 respondents aged 15C74 years, from the nationally representative Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey 2007/2008. Multimorbidity measurement was based on self-reported presence/absence of 11 chronic conditions. Selection of social determinants of health (SDH) was informed by the World Health Organizations Commission on SDH framework. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between individual-level SDH and class membership. RESULTS: Approximately one-quarter of the sample (24.05%) were multimorbid. LCA revealed four distinct profiles: a Relatively Healthy class (52.70%), with a single or no morbidity; and three additional classes, characterized by varying degrees and patterns of multimorbidity, labelled Metabolic (30.88%), Vascular-Inflammatory (12.21%), and Respiratory (4.20%). Upon controlling for all SDH (Model 3), advancing age and recent healthcare visits remained significant predictors of all three multimorbidity patterns (p < 0.001). Private insurance coverage (relative risk ratio, RRR = 0.63; p < 0.01) and higher educational attainment (RRR = 0.73; p < 0.05) were associated with lower relative risk of belonging to the Metabolic class while being female was a significant independent predictor of Vascular-Inflammatory class membership (RRR = 2.54; p < 0.001). Material circumstances, namely housing conditions and features of the physical and neighbourhood environment, were not significant predictors of any multimorbidity class. CONCLUSION: This study provides a nuanced understanding of the social patterning of multimorbidity in Jamaica, identifying biological, health system, and structural determinants as key factors associated with specific multimorbidity profiles. Future research using longitudinal designs would aid understanding of disease trajectories and clarify the role of SDH in mitigating risk of accumulation of diseases.","output":"Social determinants of multimorbidity in Jamaica: application of latent class analysis in a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been significant progress in our knowledge about the relationship between infectious disease and the immune system in relation to asthma, but many unanswered questions still remain.

The presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, and CAC scoring has been shown to be more predictive of cardiovascular events than other traditional risk assessment scores2. Incidental coronary calcification can be detected and quantified on non-gated CT chest scans covering the heart in the field of view3. This finding is typically not reported4 and hence an opportunity to optimise cardiovascular risk assessment and treatment is missed. The Society of Thoracic Radiology have previously highlighted that incidental coronary calcification should be reported on CT chest scans5. We sought to investigate patients presenting to our centre with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event with historical CT imaging demonstrating coronary artery calcification. Methods We retrospectively reviewed case records for all patients referred to our centre for an invasive coronary angiogram following their first known admission with an ACS event. ACS were defined according to contemporary guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology. We reviewed a 3 month period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (01/01/2019 - 31/03/2019). The national imaging database in Scotland (PACS) was interrogated to identify previous CT imaging that includes the heart in the field of view. The presence of coronary calcification was confirmed and quantified using an ordinal scoring method previously described3. The clinical radiology reports for the scans were reviewed to determine the frequency of CAC being reported. Demographic information was collected from our electronic patient record (Clinical Portal) including the presence of risk factors for IHD. Prescribed medication prior to admission was also recorded using the on-admission medicines reconciliation documented in the electronic patient record. Results 385 patients with first presentation of ACS were identified (figure 1). 75 (19%) had a prior non-gated CT chest imaging. The most common indication for CT was for investigation of possible malignancy. The mean interval from CT imaging to ACS admission was 36 months.CAC was present on 67 (89%) scans. The mean ordinal score was 4.04, corresponding to moderate CAC. The distribution of CAC by coronary artery revealed the majority of disease to involve the left anterior descending artery (table 1). Only 12/67 (18%) of clinical radiology reports mentioned coronary calcification (figure 2). Patients with CAC frequently had risk factors for IHD (table 2). Despite this only 42% were prescribed antiplatelet therapy, and only 45% prescribed a statin. Conclusions A significant proportion of ACS admissions have evidence of CAC on historical CT scans. This finding is often not reported and the majority of patients with demonstrated coronary artery disease are not prescribed appropriate preventative therapies.

Exogenous trypsin as a medium additive facilitates isolation and propagation of several coronaviruses in vitro . Here, we showed that trypsin mediated the enhancement of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in cultured cells and that SARS-CoV-2 entered the cells via either a non-endosomal or an endosomal fusion pathway depending on the presence of trypsin. Interestingly, trypsin enabled viral entry at the cell surface and led to more efficient infection efficiency than trypsin-independent endosomal entry, suggesting that trypsin production in the target organs may trigger high replication of SARS-CoV-2 and cause severe tissue injury. Extensive syncytia formation and enhanced growth kinetics were observed only in the presence of exogenous trypsin for the cell-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strains. During 50 serial passages without trypsin addition, a specific R685S mutation occurred in the S1/S2 FCS ( 681 PRRAR 685 ) that was completely conserved but with several mutations in the S2 fusion subunit in the presence of trypsin. These findings demonstrate that S1/S2 FCS is essential for S protein proteolytic priming and fusion activity for SARS-CoV-2 entry but not for SARS-CoV-2 replication.

The first two cases of COVID-19 were detected in Venezuela on March 13, 2020. The aim of this study was the genetic characterization of Venezuelan SARS-CoV-2 isolates. A total of 7 full SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing, from patients of different regions of Venezuela, mainly from the beginning of the epidemic. Ten out of 11 isolates (6 complete genomes and 4 partial spike genomic regions) belonged to lineage B, bearing the D614G mutation in the Spike protein. Isolates from the first outbreak that occurred in the Margarita Island harbored an in-frame deletion in its sequence, without amino acids 83C85 of the NSP1 of the ORF1. The search for deletions in 48,635 sequences showed that the NSP1 gene exhibit the highest frequency of deletions along the whole genome. Structural analysis suggests a change in the N-terminal domain with the presence of this deletion. In contrast, isolates circulating later in this island lacked the deletion, suggesting new introductions to the island after this first outbreak. In conclusion, a high diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates were found circulating in Venezuela, with predominance of the D614G mutation.

A novel method is presented based on estimating protein backbone free energy via geometry to predict effective antiviral targets, antigens and vaccine cargos that are resistant to viral mutation. This method, partly described in earlier work of the author, is reviewed and reformulated here in light of the recent proliferation of structural data on the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and its latest mutations in the variants of concern and several further variants of interest including all international lineages. Particular attention to structures computed with Cryo Electron Microscopy allows the novel approach of probing the pH dependence of free energy in order to infer function. Key findings include: collections of recurring mutagenic residues occur across strains, presumably through cooperative convergent evolution; the preponderance of mutagenic residues do not participate in backbone hydrogen bonds; metastability of the spike glycoprotein limits the change of free energy from before to after mutation and thereby constrains selective pressure; and there are mRNA or virus-vector cargos which target low free energy peptides proximal to conserved high free energy peptides providing specific recipes for vaccines with greater specificity than the current full-spike approach. These results serve to limit peptides in the spike glycoprotein with high mutagenic potential and thereby provide a priori constraints on viral and attendant vaccine evolution.

Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with elevated cardiac troponin are more likely to require the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation and have a higher risk of death. However, studies on the impact of elevated troponins at the time of hospital admission on mortality of ICU patients are limited. Here we aim to characterize, compare, and analyze COVID-19 patients in our institution's ICUs who had elevated troponins. Methods:This study is a retrospective analysis of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICUs of a tertiary care hospital between 03/01/2020 and 05/31/2020. Myocardial injury was defined as troponin  0.04 ng/mL. Only patients who had troponins measured within 24 hours of hospital admission were included. We excluded patients with a past medical history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We also excluded those patients who were transferred to our ICU from another hospital and where admission labs from the transferring institution were not available for our review. We compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients who had elevated troponins with those who did not.Results: Of the 210 patients admitted with COVID-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, 178 had troponin measured within 24 hours of hospital admission. 25 patients had a past medical history of CKD or ESRD and 11 patients were transferred from another hospital with no labs available from their day of admission. Of the 142 remaining patients, 72 (50.7%) had an elevated troponin while 70 (49.9%) had a normal troponin at presentation. Patients with elevated troponins were older (67.5  15.1 vs 60.2  14.2), and predominantly male (72.2% vs. 54.3%). Inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in both groups but not statistically different. Therapies provided were similar in both groups. Most importantly, patients with an elevated troponin had significantly increased risk of mortality compared to those with a normal troponin at admission (55.6% vs. 34.3%).Conclusion: Our results suggest that myocardial injury is a common occurrence in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission. Additionally, mortality in this population is significantly higher further indicating myocardial injury as a predictor of mortality. To determine if elevated troponin levels are independent of other risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 such as age, and gender will need to be determined in future studies.","output":"Impact of elevated troponins on mortality of ICU patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WALK INTO THE CAMBRIDGE, ONT , OFFICE of health-care equipment company PrescientX and you probably wouldn't suspect you're entering one of the most sanitary places in North America ?

Stroke causes serious neurological disorders, such as reduced motor skills of limbs and muscles, cognitive, visual and coordination significantly. The process of monitoring motor coordination function in stroke rehabilitation is generally in the form of observing movement abilities. This technique has lower quantifiable accuracy. Therefore, it is important to use objective approaches to obtain the appropriate diagnosis for effective rehabilitation process. Recently EEG has been used as a tool for monitoring stroke rehabilitation especially for motor coordination functions. Moreover, due to COVID-19 pandemic, it was reported by WHO that there was a significant decrease in visits of stroke patients to hospitals. Delay in the stroke therapy process could increase patient morbidity and mortality. Based on those reasons, home care stroke therapy then becomes an alternative solution. This research evaluates the effectiveness of home care stroke therapy compared to hospital care by using EEG. In order to determine the effectiveness of one therapy, a hypothesis T-test was calculated between the two methods. The EEG from C3 and C4 channels of 6 stroke patients when performing 8 times of rehabilitation program were compared. The motion that was tested is shoulder flexion extension on the affected upper limb from each patient. EEG preprocessing was done by applying Infinite Impulse Response for band pass filter and then Automatic Artifact Removal and Independent Component Analysis for artifact removal. Standard deviation (STD) values were calculated and analyzed for every patient in each rehabilitation program. The result shows that the STD value from home care therapy shows more increase compared to those who did the therapy at the hospital. The t-statistical value of the low alpha amplitude between homecare and hospital therapy also shows that there is a significant difference in the results of therapy carried out at home compared to in the hospital. From this result we conclude that stroke home care therapy in the new normal era is more effective compared to hospital care therapy for stroke patients. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Homecare and Hospital Stroke Therapy Comparison Using EEG Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":": OBJECTIVES: The incidence of pneumomediastinum (PNMD), its causes of development and its effect on prognosis in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are not clear. METHODS: Between March 2020 and December 2020, 427 patients with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit were analysed retrospectively. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) for initial invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) variables such as initial peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F ratio), tidal volume, compliance and positive end-expiratory pressure was evaluated regarding PNMD development. RESULTS: The incidence of PNMD was 5.6% (n = 24). PNMD development rate was 2.7% in non-invasive MV and 6.2% in MV [odds ratio (OR) 2.352, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.541C10.232; P = 0.400]. In the multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors affecting the development of PNMD were PIP (OR 1.238, 95% CI 1.091C1.378; P < 0.001) and P/F ratio (OR 0.982, 95% CI 0.971C0.994; P = 0.004).

METHODS: Clinical data and treatment plans of ACC patients, consecutively treated from January 2013 to September 2016 within the phase II clinical trial CNAO S9/2012/C, were retrospectively reviewed. ORN and other treatment-related toxicity were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTACE), version 4.0. The maxillary bone was contoured on the planning CT, and only patients receiving more than 10% of the prescription dose at their maxilla were considered for the analysis (67 patients). The volumes of maxilla receiving doses from 10 Gy (RBE) to 60 Gy (RBE) (V(D)), with an increment of 10 Gy (RBE), and additional clinical factors were correlated to the incidence of ORN with univariate analysis (Chi-square test). The logistic regression model was subsequently applied for multivariate analysis. Treatment plans calculated with a local effect model (LEM)-based optimization were recalculated with the modified microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM), and compared with literature data from the Japanese experience. RESULTS: The median time interval from the start of CIRT to ORN appearance was 24 months (range, 8C54 months). Maxillary ORN was observed in 11 patients (16.4%). Grade 1 ORN was observed in 2 patients (18.1%), G2 in 4 (36.3%), G3 in 4 (36.3%) and G4 in 1 (9.3%). From univariate analysis, the site of the tumor, the presence of teeth within the PTV and acute mucositis correlated with the development of maxillary ORN. V(D) were significantly higher for all the dose levels tested in patients with maxillary ORN than patients without necrosis, according to both radiobiological models. The multivariate analysis showed that V60 significantly correlated with ORN risk. CONCLUSION: The volume of maxilla irradiated with high dose values was relevant for ORN development in our cohort of ACC patients. These results are in line with previously published data obtained with a different radiobiological model. Our findings might be helpful to prevent the risk of ORN in patients receiving CIRT.","output":"Dosimetric and Clinical Risk Factors for the Development of Maxillary Osteoradionecrosis in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) Patients Treated With Carbon Ion Radiotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Physician burnout is considered a great public health problem, and the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it worse. The pandemic put several physical and emotional stressors on the frontline healthcare providers leading to increased burnout.

We aimed to inform decision makers at an early stage about targeted COVID vaccination strategies, accounting for limited capacities and adherence to support vaccination prioritization in Austria. METHODS: We applied a dynamic agent-based population model to compare different vaccination prioritization strategies targeting the elderly (65  years), middle aged (45-64 years), younger (15-44 years), vulnerable (risk of severe disease due to comorbidities), and healthcare workers (HCW), to minimize COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths. First, outcomes were optimized for an initially available vaccine batch for 200,000 individuals. Second, stepwise optimization was performed, deriving a prioritization sequence for 2.5 million people. We considered sterilizing and non-sterilizing immunity, with different assumptions of effectiveness, over a 6-month period. The project team was advised by a Standing Policy and Expert Panel, consisting of Austrian decision makers, clinical and ethical experts as well as international modeling specialists. RESULTS: Maximum reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved by starting vaccinations with the elderly and vulnerable, followed by middle-aged, HCW, and younger individuals. Optimizations for vaccinating 2.5 million individuals yielded the same prioritization and avoided about one third of deaths and hospitalizations. Starting vaccination with HCWs leads to slightly smaller reductions. The negative effects of COVID-19-related HCW absenteeism were not yet considered in our model. CONCLUSIONS: Our decision-analytic study shows that the elderly and vulnerable should be prioritized for vaccination until further vaccines are available to minimize COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths. An important ethical aspect complementing our modeling results is the protection of HCW, maximizing their occupational safety and ensuring risk-compensatory justice. KEY MESSAGES: To minimize COVID\\\\19\\\\related hospitalizations and death the elderly and vulnerable should be prioritized for vaccination until further vaccines are available.

METHODS AND PROCEDURE The WISC-V was used to assess cognitive abilities in 70 adolescents (M = 14 years 6 months, SD = 10 months). Sixty-six adolescents (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Level I, n = 26 ; II, n = 23; III, n = 15; IV, n = 1; V, n = 1) obtained either a Motor-free IQ or index score using the motor-free method. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS MFIQ and index scores fell below the normative data and rates of borderline and impaired cognitive abilities were significantly higher in the CP group. Scores showed an uneven cognitive profile with a relative strength in verbal abilities. Severity of motor impairment and small for gestational age (SGA) were associated with lower IQ scores. A history of seizures was related to lower verbal abilities. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Cognitive abilities of adolescents with CP are significantly below expectation compared to normative data. Severity of motor impairment, SGA, and seizures need to be recognised by health professionals as risk factors for cognitive impairment.

One means to help protect research data from use in civil or criminal matters in the United States is a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC). Until recently, investigators applied for a CoC when conducting research that was sensitive, stigmatizing or where the disclosure of private information could possibly result in civil or criminal liability. However, effective October 1, 2017, CoCs are automatically issued for much research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). While automatic issuance reduces administrative burden, it also poses some surprising unanticipated challenges for research in general and pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) in particular, which are key elements of learning health systems. METHODS: We reviewed the new policy on CoCs to identify and analyze issues related to it that are potentially problematic for PCTs. RESULTS: We identified three relevant issues: (1) whether the EHR may be populated with research data that may be sensitive or stigmatizing without explicit consent from subjects; (2) incomplete protections for sensitive data in the EHR; and (3) requirements for notifying subjects about the CoC provisions. CONCLUSION: Formal guidance from the NIH is needed to address the application of CoCs to the setting of PCTs. In the meantime, it is essential for researchers designing and conducting PCTs, as well as health care systems in which this research is conducted, to be aware of the nuances inherent in CoCs so they can best adhere to their legal obligations regarding them. In the absence of guidance, special attention should be paid to pragmatic research that populates the electronic health record with research data as well as research conducted without explicit consent.

Generally, single-cell RNA data analysis pipelines include data normalization, size reduction, and unsupervised clustering. However, different normalization and size reduction methods will significantly affect the results of clustering and cell type enrichment analysis. Choices of preprocessing paths is crucial in scRNA-Seq data mining, because a proper preprocessing path can extract more important information from complex raw data and lead to more accurate clustering results. RESULTS: We proposed a method called NDRindex (Normalization and Dimensionality Reduction index) to evaluate data quality of outcomes of normalization and dimensionality reduction methods. The method includes a function to calculate the degree of data aggregation, which is the key to measuring data quality before clustering. For the five single-cell RNA sequence datasets we tested, the results proved the efficacy and accuracy of our index. CONCLUSIONS: This method we introduce focuses on filling the blanks in the selection of preprocessing paths, and the result proves its effectiveness and accuracy. Our research provides useful indicators for the evaluation of RNA-Seq data.","output":"NDRindex: a method for the quality assessment of single-cell RNA-Seq preprocessing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of a 60-year old female patient with advanced severe lung injury as a consequence of COVID-19-pneumonia.

After failure of mechanical ventilation because of persistant severe hypoxemia treatment was switched to ECMO which was applicated for 24 days. Prognostic parameters indicated a favourable trend after day 14. After discontinuation of ECMO and 11 days of intermittent assisted ventilation via tracheostoma and low dose oxygen (1a??l/min), the patient could be transferred to rehabilitation.

We examined two exercise programmes that have proven to be self-sustaining with the goal of identifying features they share that may contribute to their success. METHODS We compared the FC Prostata football (soccer) league in Denmark and the 'Butts in a Boat' (BIAB) dragon-boating team in Canada. The FC Prostata Project Coordinator and the BIAB team leaders provided information on their programmes' history and structure. RESULTS Both programmes are team-based with regularly scheduled intense exercise at their core. In both cases, social activities evolved spontaneously, starting with the men going out for food and/or drinks after practices. The sustainability of these programmes may be driven by the regular socialisation linked to the fitness activities. CONCLUSIONS Our case studies suggest that exercise programmes for PCa patients may have a good chance of being self-sustaining, if they are: (1) centred around intense exercise, (2) of a team nature, (3) structured to promote egalitarianism and avoid one-on-one competition within teams, yet (4) have some competitions between teams. The data suggest that informal social activities organised by patients after team practices may be important for building fellowship and strengthening patients' commitment to exercise both for themselves and for their team members.","output":"Case studies on psychosocial factors that help make exercise programmes for prostate cancer patients self-sustaining."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mass casualty incidents such as those that are being experienced during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic can overwhelm local healthcare systems, where the number of casualties exceeds local resources and capabilities in a short period of time. The influx of patients with lung function deterioration as a result of COVID-19 has strained traditional ventilator supplies. To bridge the gap during ventilator shortages and to help clinicians triage patients, manual resuscitator devices can be used to deliver respirations to a patient requiring breathing support. Bag-valve mask (BVM) devices are ubiquitous in ambulances and healthcare environments, however require a medical professional to be present and constantly applying compression to provide the patient with respirations. We developed an automated manual resuscitator-based emergency ventilator-alternative (AMREV) that provides automated compressions of a BVM in a repetitive manner and is broadly compatible with commercially-available BVM devices approximately 5 inches (128 mm) in diameter. The AMREV device relieves the medical professional from providing manual breathing support and allows for hands-free operation of the BVM. The AMREV supports the following treatment parameters: 1) adjustable tidal volume (V(T)), 2) positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (intrinsic and/or external), 3) 1:1 inspiratory: expiratory ratio, and 4) a controllable respiratory rate between 10-30 breaths per minute. The relationship between the inherent resistance and compliance of the lung and the delivered breaths was assessed for the AMREV device. Adjustable V(T) of 110-700 ml was achieved within the range of simulated lung states. A linear increase in mean airway pressure (P(aw)), from 10-40 cmH(2)O was observed, as the resistance and compliance on the lung model moved from normal to severe simulated disease states. The AMREV functioned continuously for seven days with less than 3.2% variation in delivered V(T) and P(aw). Additionally, the AMREV device was compatible with seven commercially-available BVM setups and delivered consistent V(T) and P(aw) within 10% between models. This automated BVM-based emergency-use resuscitator can provide consistent positive pressure, volume-controlled ventilation over an extended duration when a traditional ventilator is not available. True ventilator shortages may lead to manual resuscitators devices such as the AMREV being the only option for some healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Development and Evaluation of an Automated Manual Resuscitator-Based Emergency Ventilator-Alternative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The first wave of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) dramatically affected the Transfusion Medicine Unit of the Azienda Unit Sanitari Locale - Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (AUSL-IRCCS) di Reggio Emilia, which faced a total rearrangement of the procedures for donors and patients. This study aims to assess the major implications of COVID-19 on our department, focusing on the blood transfusion chain and therapies, in order to support transfusion specialists in seeking efficient ways to face similar future emergencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study compares our Transfusion Medicine Unit data collected between February and May 2020 with the same period in 2017-2019. Data on red blood cells and platelets donations, transfusions and clinical procedures were collected as aggregates from our internal electronic database. RESULTS: During the lockdown, donor centres were re-organized to reduce the risk of contagion and avoid unnecessary blood collection. Blood donations were re-scheduled to meet the decrease in elective surgery; consequently, plateletapheresis was implemented to supply the reduction of buffycoat-derived platelets. Transfusions significantly decreased together with orthopaedic and vascular surgery, while they were only marginally diminished for both cancer and onco-haematological patients. Reduced procedures for inpatients and outpatients were matched by remote medicine, addressing the need of a constant healthcare support for patients with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The described measures were adopted to avoid excessive blood collection and expiration, guarantee the safety of our ward (for both patients and staff) and supply the necessary transfusion therapies. These measures may support the development of appropriate risk management plans and safety procedures for other hospitals and transfusion services that have to face similar events.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the Transfusion Medicine Unit of a Northern Italy Hospital and Cancer Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular complications are common in COVID-19 and strongly associated with disease severity and mortality. However, the mechanisms driving cardiac injury and failure in COVID-19 are largely unknown. We performed plasma proteomics on 80 COVID-19 patients and controls, grouped according to disease severity and cardiac involvement. Findings were validated in 305 independent COVID-19 patients and investigated in an animal model. Here we show that senescence-associated secretory proteins, markers of biological aging, strongly associate with disease severity and cardiac involvement even in age-matched cohorts. FSTL3, an indicator of Activin/TGF signaling, was the most significantly upregulated protein associated with the heart failure biomarker, NTproBNP ( = 0.4;p(adj)=4.6x10(?7)), while ADAMTS13, a vWF-cleaving protease whose loss-of-function causes microvascular thrombosis, was the most downregulated protein associated with myocardial injury (=?0.4;p(adj)=8x10(?7)).

The authors presented 4 adult immunocompetent patients with acute aseptic meningitis with VZV infection diagnosed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). CASE PRESENTATION: Four patients were admitted to the hospital with headache and fever between March 2018 and August 2019. The median ages were 37 years (range 22-52 years). The median symptoms onset to clinic time was 3.5 days (range 3-6 days). Two patients had signs of meningeal irritation. Rash occurred after the meningitis symptoms in 1 patient (time from meningitis symptoms to rash, 2 days). No other sign or symptom was reported. The brain Magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography were normal in all patients. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained at a median of 4 days (range 3-7 days) from the meningitis symptoms onset. Opening pressure of lumbar puncture after admission were high in these cases (median 256 mm H2O; range 165-400 mm H2O). White blood cell counts and protein levels were significantly elevated in CSF samples (median 317  10^6/L, range 147-478  10^6/L; median 1.41 g/L, range 0.57-1.79 g/L). The cytology of CSF demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and most multinuclear cells. The culture of CSF was negative for all 4 cases, while T-cell spot test was positive for 2 cases, who were administrated with anti-tuberculosis treatment for suspicious tuberculous meningitis. NGS of CSF (the Vision Medical Research Institute) detected specific sequences of VZV in the 4 cases within 72 h after admission. The inappropriate treatment were stopped while acyclovir were continued intravenously for 10-14 days. All patients recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS: VZV is an infectious agent that causes aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent adults and could not be accompanied by skin manifestations. The NGS of CSF is a rapid detection for the identification and differentiation of meningitis in patients, which is of great importance for providing the rapid and accurate diagnosis and the targeted antimicrobial therapy for central nervous system infection.","output":"Clinical features of aseptic meningitis with varicella zoster virus infection diagnosed by next-generation sequencing: case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the financial challenges facing the U.S higher education industry mount, colleges and universities seek new activities that can improve their financial situation. Online education programs are often viewed as a promising option due to growing student interest and the substantial net revenue generated by early entrants that leveraged economies of scale and scope. The number of schools that can experience similar outcomes will depend upon whether the online market is primarily concentrated, with a small number of higher education institutions enrolling most students, rather than fragmented, with large numbers of institutions enrolling meaningful amounts of online students. We examine this topic by providing the first detailed study of market concentration in online education. We first introduce a theory from economics, Suttons model of endogenous fixed costs, to the higher education literature to highlight key dynamics that shape concentration levels. Using institution-level enrollment data for the population of Title IV postsecondary institutions, we then empirically examine concentration levels in online education. We find that relative to in-person education, national online enrollment patterns are heavily concentrated. The online market has a distinctive structure, consisting of a small number of large national providers and a large number of small local providers. Online enrollment patterns became less concentrated between Fall 2012 and Fall 2018 due to major enrollment declines of large for-profit providers. Concentration levels, however, plateaued by the end of the period due to rapid enrollment growth at large national nonprofit providers.","output":"Concentrated or Fragmented?

OBJECTIVE: To examine the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary clinical outcomes of a smoking cessation intervention for individuals who are incarcerated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 2019 to May 2020. Participants were recruited in a pretrial county jail in a large Midwestern US city and were followed up after release. Participants were incarcerated, smoked daily before incarceration, desired to stay quit or reduce cigarette smoking upon release, and expected to be released to the community within 90 days of enrollment. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomized to the counseling plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) group received 1 hour of smoking cessation counseling in jail, a supply of nicotine lozenges upon release, and up to 4 telephone counseling sessions after release. Those randomized to brief health education (BHE) received 30 minutes of general health education in jail. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary clinical outcome was biologically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 3 weeks after release. Secondary clinical outcomes included 7-day PPA at 12 weeks, changes in number of cigarettes per day, and time to smoking lapse and relapse. RESULTS: A total of 46 participants (42 men [91%]; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [9.1] years) were enrolled and remained eligible at release; 23 were randomized to the counseling plus NRT group and 23 were randomized to the BHE group. Recruitment, enrollment, and retention of participants was feasible and acceptable. There were no significant differences in smoking abstinence between groups as determined by 7-day PPA at 3 weeks (adjusted 7-day PPA, 11.9% for counseling plus NRT vs 10.6% for BHE; odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.14-9.07) and at 12 weeks (adjusted 7-day PPA, 11.1% for counseling plus NRT vs 14.3% for BHE; odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.09-6.11). Cigarettes per day for the counseling plus NRT group decreased more compared with the BHE group at both 3 weeks (difference [SE], ?4.58 [1.58] cigarettes per day; 95% CI, ?7.67 to ?1.48 cigarettes per day; P = .007) and 12 weeks (difference [SE], ?3.26 [1.58] cigarettes per day; 95% CI, ?5.20 to ?0.20 cigarettes per day; P = .04) after release. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Initiation of counseling plus NRT during incarceration and continuing after release is feasible and acceptable to participants and may be associated with reduced cigarette use after release. However, additional supports are needed to increase engagement in telephone counseling after release. A larger clinical trial is warranted to determine the effectiveness of counseling plus NRT.

Pulmonary microvascular thrombosis has also been described and the risk for arterial thrombotic diseases also appears to be increased while bleeding is less common than thrombosis, but it can occur. Evaluation for venous thromboembolism may be challenging because symptoms of pulmonary embolism overlap with COVID-19, and imaging studies may not be feasible in all cases. The threshold for evaluation or diagnosis of thromboembolism should be low given the high frequency of these events.

Recombinant baculovirus has been recently emerged as a new vaccine vector, since it has intrinsic immunostimulatory properties and good bio-safety profile. METHODS: We have constructed a recombinant baculovirus-based RSV vaccine, Bac-RSV/G, displaying G glycoprotein, and evaluated immunogenicity and protective efficacy by intranasal immunization of BALB/c mice with Bac-RSV/G. RESULTS: Bac-RSV/G efficiently provides protective immunity against RSV challenge. Strong serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses were induced by intranasal immunization with Bac-RSV/G. In addition to humoral immunity, G-specific Th17- as well as Th1-type T-cell responses were detected in the lungs of Bac-RSV/G-immune mice upon RSV challenge. Neither lung eosinophilia nor vaccine-induced weight loss was observed upon Bac-RSV/G immunization and subsequent RSV infection. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that intranasal administration of baculovirus-based Bac-RSV/G vaccine is efficient for the induction of protection against RSV and represents a promising prophylactic vaccination regimen.","output":"Baculovirus-based Vaccine Displaying Respiratory Syncytial Virus Glycoprotein Induces Protective Immunity against RSV Infection without Vaccine-Enhanced Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current understanding of the impact of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on arrhythmias continues to evolve as new data emerge.

The implementation of linear infrastructures involves numerous forms and mechanisms of land\\\\use transformation that can facilitate and serve as pathways to the spread of invasive non\\\\native species. However, the type and intensity of land transformations change over time and this can affect the frequency and intensity in which linear infrastructures route the spread of invasive species.Here, we present results collected over 5 years of monitoring surveys (2015C2019) to assess the relationship between the construction of one of the largest canals to date in Brazil and the spread of non\\\\native species. We studied the Integration Project of the S?o Francisco River (PISF), a canal fully inserted in the Caatinga biome, a tropical dry forest ecosystem for which information on invasion dynamics are little known.Our results confirmed PISF canals served as habitat and dispersal corridors for non\\\\native plant species. Monitoring surveys recorded 26 non\\\\native species established along the 83.2 km2 PISF deployment area. Eleven years after the canal deployment area was completely cleared of vegetation, 92.3% of its extension had non\\\\native plant populations. Of the 10 species assessed for their population status, 8 had invasive populations.The time immediately after construction work finished was the critical stage for the spread of non\\\\native woody plants, which increased their distributions with reduced levels of construction intervention, whereas most of the herbaceous species reduced their distributions. When human intervention was drastically reduced, many populations of non\\\\native plants rapidly formed at the deployment area.Policy implications.

DESIGN: Multicentre evaluation incorporating quantitative and qualitative items. SETTING: Level II and level III UK neonatal units. POPULATION: Families of neonatal inpatients and neonatal staff. INTERVENTION: Use of a secure, cloud-based asynchronous video messaging service to send short messages from neonatal staff to families. Evaluation undertaken July-November 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parental experience, including anxiety, involvement in care, relationships between parents and staff, and breastmilk expression. RESULTS: In pre-implementation surveys (n=41), families reported high levels of stress and anxiety and were receptive to use of the service. In post-implementation surveys (n=42), 88% perceived a benefit of the service on their neonatal experience. Families rated a positive impact of the service on anxiety, sleep, family involvement and relationships with staff. Qualitative responses indicated enhanced emotional closeness, increased involvement in care and a positive effect on breastmilk expression. Seventy-seven post-implementation staff surveys were also collected. Staff rated the service as easy to use, with minimal impact on workload. Seventy-one percent (n=55) felt the service had a positive impact on relationships with families.

Previously, we partially characterized an OPXV isolated from an 18-year-old male living in Northern Norway. Restriction enzyme analysis and partial genome sequencing characterized this virus as an atypical cowpox virus (CPXV), which we named CPXV-No-H2. In this study, we determined the complete genome sequence of CPXV-No-H2 using Illumina and Nanopore sequencing. Our results showed that the whole CPXV-No-H2 genome is 220,276 base pairs (bp) in length, with inverted terminal repeat regions of approximately 7 kbp, containing 217 predicted genes. Seventeen predicted CPXV-No-H2 proteins were most similar to OPXV proteins from the Old World, including Ectromelia virus (ECTV) and Vaccinia virus, and North America, Alaskapox virus (AKPV). CPXV-No-H2 has a mosaic genome with genes most similar to other OPXV genes, and seven potential recombination events were identified. The phylogenetic analysis showed that CPXV-No-H2 formed a separate clade with the German CPXV isolates CPXV_GerMygEK938_17 and CPXV_Ger2010_MKY, sharing 96.4 and 96.3% nucleotide identity, respectively, and this clade clustered closely with the ECTV-OPXV Abatino clade. CPXV-No-H2 is a mosaic virus that may have arisen out of several recombination events between OPXVs, and its phylogenetic clustering suggests that ECTV-Abatino-like cowpox viruses form a distinct, new clade of cowpox viruses.","output":"Genomic Sequencing and Analysis of a Novel Human Cowpox Virus With Mosaic Sequences From North America and Old World Orthopoxvirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A majority of studies evaluating the risk of vertical transmission and adverse outcomes in pregnancies with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are mostly based on third-trimester infections. There is limited data available on pregnancy sequelae of maternal infection in the first or second trimester. STUDY DESIGN: We present a patient with monochorionic-diamniotic twins that develops coronavirus disease 2019 infection at 15 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy is further complicated by stage II twin-twin transfusion syndrome. She undergoes laser ablation, which is complicated by development of a subchorionic hematoma. The patient then develops Escherichia coli bacteremia, resulting in septic shock and preterm labor followed by previable delivery at 21 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluid and placenta were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: This case of SARS-CoV-2 argues against transplacental transmission after a second-trimester infection but brings attention to the possible downstream complications that may arise following early infection. KEY POINTS:  Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not evident after a second-trimester infection..

However, radiological imaging plays a crucial role in evaluating the course of COVID-19 and in choosing proper management of infected patients.

However, in the emergency setting CXR can be a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the rapid progression of lung involvement in COVID-19, especially in patients admitted to intensive care units. The rapid course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity and progression of lung aberrations require a method of radiological evaluation to implement and manage the appropriate treatment for infected patients. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is considered to be the most effective method for the detection of lung abnormalities, especially in the early stage of the disease. Moreover, serial chest CT imaging with different time intervals is also effective in estimating the evolution of the disease from initial diagnosis to discharge from hospital. Despite having low specificity in distinguishing abnormalities in viral infections, the high sensitivity of CT makes this method ideal for assessing the severity of the disease in patients with confirmed COVID-19.

The closed right hand architecture of RdRPs encircles seven conserved structural motifs (A to G) that regulate the polymerization activity. The four palm motifs, arranged in the sequential order A to D, are common to all known template dependent polynucleotide polymerases, with motifs A and C containing the catalytic aspartic acid residues. Exceptions to this design have been reported in members of the Permutotetraviridae and Birnaviridae families of positive single stranded (+ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, respectively. In these enzymes, motif C is located upstream of motif A, displaying a permuted CCACBCD connectivity. Here we study the details of the replication elongation process in the non-canonical RdRP of the Thosea asigna virus (TaV), an insect virus from the Permutatetraviridae family. We report the X-ray structures of three replicative complexes of the TaV polymerase obtained with an RNA template-primer in the absence and in the presence of incoming rNTPs. The structures captured different replication events and allowed to define the critical interactions involved in: (i) the positioning of the acceptor base of the template strand, (ii) the positioning of the 3-OH group of the primer nucleotide during RNA replication and (iii) the recognition and positioning of the incoming nucleotide. Structural comparisons unveiled a closure of the active site on the RNA template-primer binding, before rNTP entry.

The reproductive number of coronavirus provides an estimate of the possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide a summary reproductive number of coronavirus based on available global level evidence. METHODS: A total of three databases were searched on September 15, 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy to record studies reported the reproductive number of coronavirus from its inception in December 2019. It includes keywords of coronavirus and its reproductive number, which were combined using the Boolean operators (AND, OR). Based on the included studies, we estimated a summary reproductive number by using the meta-analysis. We used narrative synthesis to explain the results of the studies where the reproductive number was reported, however, were not possible to include in the meta-analysis because of the lack of data (mostly due to confidence interval was not reported). RESULTS: Total of 42 studies included in this review whereas 29 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated summary reproductive number was 2.87 (95% CI, 2.39-3.44). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive number reported in the included studies. Our sub-group analysis was found the significant variations of reproductive number across the country for which it was estimated, method and model that were used to estimate the reproductive number, number of case that was considered to estimate the reproductive number, and the type of reproductive number that was estimated. The highest reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.99) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 3.56, 95% CI, 1.62-7.82). The higher reproductive number was reported if it was estimated by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) method and the Epidemic curve model. We also reported significant heterogeneity of the type of reproductive number- a high-value reported if it was the time-dependent reproductive number. CONCLUSION: The estimated summary reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of coronavirus infection in the coming days.

To this end, we introduce a concept of IoT-based privacy-aware team barometer and present a first study into using inexpensive PIR (passive infrared) motion detection sensors in such barometers. The study was conducted as follows: first, we deployed IoT system in real offices and collected employee data in the course of everyday work during several months. Second, we developed a machine learning method to classify human conditions on the basis of collected PIR data. In the tests, this method recognised employees stress with 80% accuracy and dissatisfaction with indoor environmental quality - with 75% accuracy.

In the late phase, Day 10 to Day 140, a retinal degeneration is associated with the absence of viral proteins, infectious virus, and inflammatory cells. The purpose of this study was to determine if viral RNA persists within the retina during the retinal degenerative phase of the disease. BALB/c mice were inoculated by the intravitreal route with 104.0TCID50/5 l of virus. The presence of viral RNA was detected byin situhybridization with a viral cDNA probe and viral proteins were identified by immunocytochemical staining. During the acute phase of the infection, viral RNA was found in the retina, RPE, ciliary body epithelium, and the iris epithelium. During the late phase of the infection, viral RNA was almost exclusively found within the retina and RPE and not in the anterior segment of the eye. Within the retina, viral RNA was detected in the ganglion cell layer, the inner retina, the outer retina, and the RPE cell. Immunocytochemical staining identified viral protein within the retina only from Day 1 to Day 8. This ocular disease was also associated with a persistent systemic infection. Both viral RNA and viral proteins were identified within the liver during the first 8 days. However, only viral RNA was detected in the liver from Day 8 to Day 60.

The objective of this study was to identify potential structured institutional supports to graduate Public Health professionals from diverse communities to advance health equity. A secondary objective was to determine whether the needed supports for Public Health students might differ from peers in other health programs, specifically Nursing. Methods: Using a mixed methods approach and a convenience sample, data were gathered from Public Health students, nursing students, faculty, and staff from November 2019 through July 2020. The survey assessed stress, grit, and demographic factors. Focus group topics included: academic resilience and professionalism, supports and gaps in the current institutional structure with respect to mitigating student stressors, and opportunities for programmatic solutions. Results: In total, 53 Public Health and 32 in Nursing students completed the survey. Nursing students tended to be farther along in their undergraduate careers, less likely to have failed a class, and more likely to have recently been laid off from a job. Public Health students reported more support from parents, but less support from friends and classmates than their Nursing peers.

These public health measures can include social distancing, frequent handwashing, and personal protective equipment (PPE) at the personal level; at the community and the government level, these measures can range from canceling activities, avoiding mass gatherings, closing facilities, and, at the extreme, enacting national or provincial lockdowns. Rather than completely stopping the infectious disease, the major purpose of these NPIs in facing an emerging infectious disease is to reduce the contact rate within the population, and reduce the spread of the virus until the time a vaccine or reliable medications become available. The idea is to avoid a surge of patients with severe symptoms beyond the capacity of the hospitals' medical resources, which would lead to more mortality and morbidity. While many countries have experienced steep curves in new cases, some, including Hong Kong, Vietnam, South Korea, New Zealand, and Taiwan, seem to have controlled or even eliminated the infection locally.

Policymakers need guidance on how masks should be used by the general population to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, considering and synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact;transmission characteristics;source control;PPE;sociological considerations;and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory droplets, and is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: first, limit contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures, and second, reduce the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. The decreased transmissibility could substantially reduce the death toll and economic impact while the cost of the intervention is low. Given the current shortages of medical masks we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory droplets become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask-wearing by infectious people (\\"source control\\") with benefits at the population-level, rather than mask-wearing by susceptible people, such as health-care workers, with focus on individual outcomes.

Methods The Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized 1:1 and received 300ml of plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:80. The primary endpoint was day-60 mortality and key secondary endpoints were hospital stay and WHO 8-point disease severity scale improvement on day 15. Results The trial was halted prematurely after 86 patients were enrolled. Although symptomatic for only 10 days (IQR 6-15) at the time of inclusion, 53 of 66 patients tested had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. A SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test showed neutralizing antibodies in 44 of the 56 (79%) patients tested with median titers comparable to the 115 donors (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40). These observations caused concerns about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma in the study population and after discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No difference in mortality (p=0.95), hospital stay (p=0.68) or day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) was observed between plasma treated patients and patients on standard of care. Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients already have high neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission. Screening for antibodies and prioritizing convalescent plasma to risk groups with recent symptom onset will be key to identify patients that may benefit from convalescent plasma.

In the present work, we describe a subunit vaccine based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein co-administered with CpG adjuvant. To enhance the immunogenicity of our formulation, both antigen and adjuvant were encapsulated with our proprietary artificial cell membrane (ACM) polymersome technology. Structurally, ACM polymersomes are self-assembling nanoscale vesicles made up of an amphiphilic block copolymer comprising of polybutadiene-b-polyethylene glycol and a cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane. Functionally, ACM polymersomes serve as delivery vehicles that are efficiently taken up by dendritic cells, which are key initiators of the adaptive immune response. Two doses of our formulation elicit robust neutralizing titers in C57BL/6 mice that persist at least 40 days. Furthermore, we confirm the presence of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that produce Th1 cytokines.

Drug therapies and complementary medicine have been used to treat dysmenorrhea. The aim of this study was to investigate and offer an updated perspective on the treatments for dysmenorrhea. METHODS The present study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA checklist for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The required information was collected based on searches for the following keywords: treatment, primary dysmenorrhea, medicinal plants, chemical drugs, and herbs. Searches were performed on databases Pubmed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, Iran medex, and SID by March 2018 to find literature in the English and Persian languages on this subject without a time limit. RESULTS This review included 17 papers, 10 of which on complementary medicine, three on drug therapies, and four on acupuncture and acupressure. The largest and smallest samples had 303 and 24 patients, respectively. Length of treatment ranged from one to six months and the measures most commonly used in the studies were the visual analogue scale and clinical efficacy. Reported complications included gastrointestinal events, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and liver and kidney disorders. CONCLUSION Medicinal plants, drugs, and acupressure seem to suppress pain by reducing the level of prostaglandins, mediating nitric oxide, increasing beta-endorphin levels, blocking the calcium channel, and enhancing circulatory flow through the uterine pathway.

The dimeric form of the viral Mpro is responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein in 11 sites, including its own N and C-terminus. The lack of structural information for intermediary forms of Mpro is a setback for the understanding its self-maturation process. Herein, we used X-ray crystallography combined with biochemical data to characterize multiple forms of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. For the immature form, we show that extra N-terminal residues caused conformational changes in the positioning of domain-three over the active site, hampering the dimerization and diminishing its activity. We propose that this form preludes the cis and trans-cleavage of N-terminal residues. Using fragment screening, we probe new cavities in this form which can be used to guide therapeutic development. Furthermore, we characterized a serine site-directed mutant of the Mpro bound to its endogenous N and C-terminal residues during dimeric association stage of the maturation process. We suggest this form is a transitional state during the C-terminal trans-cleavage.

Several characteristics of hospitalised cases, including variations in symptoms as well as radiological and laboratory findings, have been described. However, the exact clinical spectrum of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Oman is currently unclear. The objective of this paper was to describe the sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as the treatment and clinical outcomes of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Al Nahdha Hospital, Oman. Additionally, factors associated with the severity of the disease were identified. Methodology This was a cross-sectional descriptive study of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The required data were retrieved from the electronic health information system for the period from 3rd March to 9th May 2020. Information was recorded in a bespoke sheet and exported to SPSS Statistics (IBM, Armonk, NY) for analysis. Results A total of 102 admissions were included in this study. The mean age of the cohort was 49.9 (14.7) years. The majority were males (77.5%), and more than half were expatriates (56.9%). Diabetes and hypertension were found in 39.2% and 36.3% of the study population, respectively. Common symptoms encountered were dry cough (78.3%), fever (76.5%), and shortness of breath (SOB) (69.6%). Radiologically, bilateral infiltrations were present in 73.5% of the patients. Only 19 cases required critical care (18.6%), and those were mostly older [54.1 (13.4) years], males (89.5%), and non-nationals (63.2%). Significant factors associated with requiring critical care were symptoms of SOB (89.5% vs 65.1%, p=0.03), diabetes (68.4% vs 32.5%, OR=1.5, p=0.004), chronic artery disease (15.8% vs 3.6%, OR=1.7, p=0.04), and diagnosis of acute respiratory distress symptoms (63.2% vs 6.0%, p<0.001). Additionally, the mean ferritin levels were significantly higher in cases requiring critical care [2350.4 (423.8) vs 795.7 (554.3), p=0.005]. Depending on disease severity, the treatment included antibacterials, antivirals, heparin, and steroids. The utilisation of steroids was significantly higher in the cases requiring critical care (63.2% vs 26.5%, p=0.001). Among cases that required critical care (n=19), nine died (death rate=47.4%).

Aims: A pilot study was undertaken to determine the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among febrile patients attending a malaria clinic. Subjects and Methods: All patients were tested for malaria parasite by examining thick and thin blood smears as well as by rapid malaria antigen tests. COVID-19 was detected by rapid antigen test and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in patients agreeing to undergo the test. Results: Out of 262 patients examined, 66 (25.19%) were positive for Plasmodium vivax, 45 (17.17%) for Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) with a slide positivity rate of 42.40%, and Pf% of 40.50%. Only 29 patients consented for COVID-19 testing along with malaria;of them, 3 (10.34%) were positive for COVID-19 alone and 2 (6.89%) were positive for both COVID-19 and P. vivax with an incidence of 17.24%. A maximum number of patients (196) did not examine for COVID-19 as they did not agree to do the test.

The earlier lung disease pneumonia is closely related to Covid-19, as several patients died due to high chest congestion (pneumonic condition). It is challenging to differentiate Covid-19 and pneumonia lung diseases for medical experts. The chest X-ray imaging is the most reliable method for lung disease prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the lung disease predictions like pneumonia and Covid-19 from the chest X-ray images of patients. The framework consists of dataset acquisition, image quality enhancement, adaptive and accurate region of interest (ROI) estimation, features extraction, and disease anticipation. In dataset acquisition, we have used two publically available chest X-ray image datasets. As the image quality degraded while taking X-ray, we have applied the image quality enhancement using median filtering followed by histogram equalization. For accurate ROI extraction of chest regions, we have designed a modified region growing technique that consists of dynamic region selection based on pixel intensity values and morphological operations. For accurate detection of diseases, robust set of features plays a vital role. We have extracted visual, shape, texture, and intensity features from each ROI image followed by normalization. For normalization, we formulated a robust technique to enhance the detection and classification results. Soft computing methods such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), ensemble classifier, and deep learning classifier are used for classification. For accurate detection of lung disease, deep learning architecture has been proposed using recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM).

Thus, life expectancy lost due to COVID-19 cannot be found simply by incorporating excess deaths due to COVID-19 and re-doing the life table computations because: (1) we know that the COVID-19 deaths need not occur every year for the next 20-25 years; and (2) once an adult, a newborn in 2021/2022 need not experience the same mortality rate that current middle and older aged COVID-19 patients experience.

The paper investigates the rationale for the economic policy tools implemented, their costs, and potential consequences for the Polish economy. The analysis concentrates on the initial phase of the crisis (MarchCApril 2020). The study proves that the scope of economic policy adjustments in Poland might be viewed as relatively wide. Monetary policy tools and fiscal packages implemented induce profound consequences for the Polish economy. The total new financing needed by the government for anti-crisis measures results in a significant increase in the public debt ratio, from 44% in 2019 to 51.5% in 2020, and in a state budget deficit of 7.6% of GDP in 2020. Although the projected debt ratio is still below the 55% alert threshold prescribed by the Polish legislation, policy makers should consider risk factors. First, under an extended lockdown scenario financing needs might be larger than initially estimated. Second, if the Polish zloty depreciates due to external pressures, the debt ratio increases even more as 30% of the Polish public debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Financing the fiscal packages is not possible without the support of the central bank (NBP). The scope of the quantitative easing policy required is comparable in relative terms to programmes implemented in the United States after 2009. Therefore, economic agents should expect an unprecedented increase in the NBP balance sheet and money in circulation. This should have an impact on price levels in Poland, at least in the long term.

The search for the understanding of the disease spreading made scientists around the world turn their attention to epidemiological studies. An interesting approach in epidemiological modeling nowadays is to use agent-based models, which allow to consider a heterogeneous population and to evaluate the role of superspreaders in this population. In this work, we implemented an agent-based model using probabilistic cellular automata to simulate SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) dynamics using COVID-19 infection parameters. Differently to the usual studies, we did not define the superspreaders individuals a priori, we only left the agents to execute a random walk along the sites. When two or more agents share the same site, there is a probability to spread the infection if one of them is infected. To evaluate the spreading, we built the transmission network and measured the degree distribution, betweenness, and closeness centrality. The results displayed for different levels of mobility restriction show that the degree reduces as the mobility reduces, but there is an increase of betweenness and closeness for some network nodes. We identified the superspreaders at the end of the simulation, showing the emerging behavior of the model since these individuals were not initially defined. Simulations also showed that the superspreaders are responsible for most of the infection propagation and the impact of personal protective equipment in the spreading of the infection. We believe that this study can bring important insights for the analysis of the disease dynamics and the role of superspreaders, contributing to the understanding of how to manage mobility during a highly infectious pandemic as COVID-19.","output":"Impact of mobility restriction in COVID-19 superspreading events using agent-based model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We show that the dynamics of the expiratory cloud ejected during human respiratory events can be modeled by extending the theory of buoyant vortex rings with an initial momentum.

Therefore, retrospective chart reviews were performed to identify all laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, between March 2020 and August 2020.A total of 369 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases were identified: 272 (73.7%) patients were male, and 97 (26.2%) were female. Of the confirmed cases, 218 (59.1%) had comorbidities, and 151 (40.9%) were devoid of comorbidities.

Infection of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell is characterized by direct translation of positive single stranded (+ ss) RNA to form large polyprotein polymerase 1ab (pp1ab), which acts as precursor for a number of nonstructural and structural proteins that play vital roles in replication of viral genome and biosynthesis of new virus particles. The maintenance of viral protein homeostasis is essential for continuation of viral life cycle in the host cell. To test whether the protein homeostasis of SARS-CoV-2 can be disrupted by inducing specific protein aggregation, we made an effort to examine whether the viral proteome contains any aggregation prone regions (APRs) that can be explored for inducing toxic protein aggregation specifically in viral proteins and without affecting the host cell. This curiosity leads to the identification of several (> 70) potential APRs in SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The length of the APRs ranges from 5 to 25 amino acid residues. Nearly 70% of total APRs investigated are relatively smaller and found to be in the range of 5C10 amino acids. The maximum number of ARPs (> 50) was observed in pp1ab. On the other hand, the structural proteins such as, spike (S), nucleoprotein (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins also possess APRs in their primary structures which altogether constitute 30% of the total APRs identified.

Antibodies were detected using a chemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: The average titers and IgG/IgM positivity rates reached a peak within 30 days of symptom onset and then began to decline continuously. Between 180 and 210 days following symptom onset, the titers of IgG and IgM were 43.1  27.0 AU/mL and 4.4  5.2 AU/mL, respectively, while the respective positivity rates were 84.3% and 12.0%. Further statistical analyses revealed that the dynamic changes and prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies were related to age and disease severity, but not to sex. The dynamic changes and the prevalence were similar for both the IgM and the IgG antibodies. Even so, there was a more rapid rate of decline for the IgM antibodies. It was found that an IgG level of 16.33  3.15 AU/mL may represent a threshold value that should act as an alert, as it may indicate that the IgG level will become undetectable within the next 30-60 days.

We investigated whether LW-213 exerted anti-CML effects and the underlying mechanisms. We showed that LW-213 inhibited the growth of human CML cell lines K562 and imatinid-resistant K562 (K562r) in dose- and time-dependent manners with IC(50) values at the low mol/L levels. LW-213 (5, 10, 15 M) caused G(2)/M phase arrest of K562 and K562r cells via reducing the activity of G2/M phase transition-related proteins Cyclin B1/CDC2 complex. LW-213 treatment induced apoptosis of K562 and K562r cells via inhibiting the expression of CDK9 through lysosome degradation, thus leading to the suppression of RNAPII phosphorylation, down-regulation of a short-lived anti-apoptic protein MCL-1. The lysosome inhibitor, NH(4)Cl, could reverse the anti-CML effects of LW-213 including CDK9 degradation and apoptosis.

DESIGN AND METHODS Mixtures of drug-free urine with various commercial products and materials that commonly contact newborns in our nursery were prepared and tested using the immunoassay screening methods in our laboratory. Additional commercial products were similarly tested; and when available, individual surfactants common to the interfering products were also evaluated. RESULTS Addition of Head-to-Toe Baby Wash to drug-free urine produced a dose dependent measureable response in the THC immunoassay. Addition of other commercially available baby soaps gave similar results, and subsequent testing identified specific chemical surfactants that reacted with the THC immunoassay.

The aim of this study was to determine the associations of person-related, environment-related and communication-related factors on the severity of medication errors occurring in two health services. METHODS A retrospective clinical audit of medication errors was undertaken over an 18-month period at two Australian health services comprising 16 hospitals. Descriptive statistical analysis, and univariate and multivariable regression analysis were undertaken. RESULTS There were 11,540 medication errors reported to the online facility of both health services. Medication errors caused by doctors (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.690, 95% CI 0.618-0.771), or by pharmacists (OR 0.327, 95% CI 0.267-0.401), or by patients or families (OR 0.641, 95% CI 0.472-0.870) compared to those caused by nurses or midwives were significantly associated with reduced odds of possibly or probably harmful medication errors. The presence of double-checking of medication orders compared to single-checking (OR 0.905, 95% CI 0.826-0.991) was significantly associated with reduced odds of possibly or probably harmful medication errors. The presence of electronic systems for prescribing (OR 0.580, 95% CI 0.480-0.705) and dispensing (OR 0.350, 95% CI 0.199-0.618) were significantly associated with reduced odds of possibly or probably harmful medication errors compared to the absence of these systems. Conversely, insufficient counselling of patients (OR 3.511, 95% CI 2.512-4.908), movement across transitions of care (OR 1.461, 95% CI 1.190-1.793), presence of interruptions (OR 1.432, 95% CI 1.012-2.027), presence of covering personnel (OR 1.490, 95% 1.113-1.995), misread or unread orders (OR 2.411, 95% CI 2.162-2.690), informal bedside conversations (OR 1.221, 95% CI 1.085-1.373), and problems with clinical handovers (OR 1.559, 95% CI 1.136-2.139) were associated with increased odds of medication errors causing possible or probable harm. Patients or families were involved in the detection of 1100 (9.5%) medication errors. CONCLUSIONS Patients and families need to be engaged in discussions about medications, and health professionals need to provide teachable opportunities during bedside conversations, admission and discharge consultations, and medication administration activities. Patient counselling needs to be more targeted in effort to reduce medication errors associated with possible or probable harm.","output":"Associations of person-related, environment-related and communication-related factors on medication errors in public and private hospitals: a retrospective clinical audit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Once an epidemic outbreak has been effectively contained through non-pharmaceutical interventions, a safe protocol is required for the subsequent release of social distancing restrictions to prevent a disastrous resurgence of the infection.

there are many asymptomatic cases, and diagnostic testing can have capacity limitations and extended time to results. Although numerous studies have utilized wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, the methods used were developed and/or standardized for other pathogens. This study evaluates multiple methods for concentration and recovery of SARS-CoV-2 and seeded human coronavirus OC43 from municipal primary wastewater and/or sludge from the Greater Seattle Area (March-July 2020). Methods evaluated include the bag-mediated filtration system (BMFS), with and without Vertrel&#8482; extraction, skimmed milk flocculation, with and without Vertrel&#8482; extraction, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, ultrafiltration, and sludge extraction. Total RNA was extracted from wastewater concentrates and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 with RT-qPCR. Skimmed milk flocculation without Vertrel&#8482; extraction performed consistently over time and between treatment plants in Seattle-area wastewater with the lowest average OC43 Cq value and smallest variability (24.3; 95% CI: 23.8-24.9), most frequent SARS-CoV-2 detection (48.8% of sampling events), and highest average OC43 percent recovery (9.1%; 95% CI: 6.2-11.9%). Skimmed milk flocculation is also beneficial because it is feasible in low-resource settings. While the BMFS had the highest average volume assayed of 11.9 mL (95% CI: 10.7-13.1 mL), the average OC43 percent recovery was low (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.4-1.0%). Ultrafiltration and PEG precipitation had low average OC43 percent recoveries of 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5-1.6%) and 3.2% (95% CI: 1.3-5.1%), respectively. The slopes and efficiency for the SARS-CoV-2 standard curves were not consistent over time, confirming the need to include a standard curve each run rather than using a single curve for multiple plates. Results suggest that the concentration and detection methods used must be validated for the specific water matrix using a recovery control to assess performance over time.","output":"A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentration methods for environmental surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycorrhizal fungi are critical components of terrestrial habitats and agroecosystems. Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte fungi (MucFRE) were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with Lycopodiella inundata, which belongs to one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1305 individual L. inundata roots from 275 plants collected during spring and autumn 2019 across 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of fine root endophyte (FRE) hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. Fine root endophyte hyphae were dominant in all of the examined heathlands, and every colonized root had FRE in both cortical cells and root hairs. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonized in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, correlating with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to root and related hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about FRE from single time point collections should be carefully interpreted. Our findings are relevant to habitat restoration, species conservation plans, agricultural bio-inoculation treatments, and microbial diversity studies.

In this study we examined cross phosphorylation of RprY on tyrosine residues and its importance for RprY function. We show that RprY reacts with phosphotyrosine antibodies, and a tyrosine (Y) residue at position 41 is predicted to be solvent accessible. Loss of RprY increased the level of heterotypic community development with Streptococcus gordonii, and the community-suppressive function of RprY required Y41. Expression of the Mfa1 fimbrial adhesin was increased in the rprY mutant and in the mutant complemented with rprY containing a Y41F mutation. In a microscale thermophoresis assay, recombinant RprY protein bound to the promoter region of mfa1, and binding was diminished in RprY with a Y41F substitution. RprY was required for virulence of P. gingivalis in a murine model of alveolar bone loss. Transcriptional profiling indicated that RprY can control the expression of genes encoding the type IX secretion system (T9SS) machinery and virulence factors secreted through the T9SS, including the gingipain proteases and peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD). Collectively, these results establish the RprY response regulator as a component of the tyrosine phosphorylation regulon in P. gingivalis, which can independently control heterotypic community development through the Mfa1 fimbriae, and virulence through the T9SS.","output":"Role of the RprY Response Regulator in P. gingivalis Community Development and Virulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paulinella photosynthetic species are unicellular, silica shell-forming amoebas classified into the supergroup Rhizaria. They crawl at the bottom of freshwater and brackish environments with the help of filose pseudopodia. These protists have drawn the attention of the scientific community because of two photosynthetic bodies, called chromatophores, that fill up their cells permitting fully photoautotrophic existence. Paulinella chromatophores, similarly to primary plastids of the Archaeplastida supergroup (including glaucophytes, red algae as well as green algae and land plants), evolved from free-living cyanobacteria in the process of endosymbiosis. Interestingly, these both cyanobacterial acquisitions occurred independently, thereby undermining the paradigm of the rarity of endosymbiotic events. Chromatophores were derived from -cyanobacteria relatively recently 60-140 million years ago, whereas primary plastids originated from -cyanobacteria more than 1.5 billion years ago. Since their acquisition, chromatophore genomes have undergone substantial reduction but not to the extent of primary plastid genomes. Consequently, they have also developed mechanisms for transport of metabolites and nuclear-encoded proteins along with appropriate targeting signals. Therefore, chromatophores of Paulinella photosynthetic species, similarly to primary plastids, are true cellular organelles. They not only show that endosymbiotic events might not be so rare but also make a perfect model for studying the process of organellogenesis.

SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse-transcriptaseCpolymerase-chain-reaction. General characteristics and chronic comorbidities were explored. Clinical outcomes of interest were hospital admission, pneumonia, intensive care unit admission, endotracheal intubation and mortality. Prevalence of chronic comorbidities was 49.4%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the effect of age, male sex, bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease on clinical outcomes was similar for both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Adverse clinical outcomes were associated with the time from symptoms onset to medical contact, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and obesity in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, but with cardiovascular disease in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (p value < 0.01 for all comparisons).

However, some mathematical models predict that if infected individuals are treated with antiviral drugs with efficacy below 100%, viral shedding may last longer than without treatment because further de novo infections are driven by entry of the virus into partially protected, uninfected cells at a slower rate. Using a simple mathematical model, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in non-human primates and characterized the kinetics of viral shedding.

Zinc balances immune responses, and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses. Importantly, zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases, two groups with an increased risk for severe severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. We hypothesize that serum zinc content (SZC) influences COVID-19 disease progression, and thus might represent a useful biomarker. METHODS: We ran an observational cohort study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted in Hospital del Mar. We have studied COVID-19 severity and progression attending to SZC at admission. In parallel, we have studied severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) replication in the Vero E6 cell line modifying zinc concentrations. FINDINGS: Our study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19 outcome. Serum zinc levels lower than 50 g/dL at admission correlated with worse clinical presentation, longer time to reach stability, and higher mortality. Our in vitro results indicate that low zinc levels favor viral expansion in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. INTERPRETATION: Low SZC is a risk factor that determines COVID-19 outcome.

In the Case group, association with mortality was found for male gender (p = 0.041), right side (p = 0.031) and COVID-19 positive test results (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Early surgical intervention is advocated wherever possible, and sufficient optimisation, prior to surgery whenever a COVID-19 positive patient is identified. A safe rehabilitation environment is paramount for recovery in this group of patients. Further studies are required to understand the effect of this pandemic on the fragility hip fractures.

Reprocessing of used N95 respirators may provide a higher filtration crisis alternative, but it is unknown if effective sterilization can be achieved for a virus without impairing respirator function. We evaluated the viricidal efficacy of Bioquell vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) on contaminated N95 respirators and tested the particulate particle penetration and inhalation/exhalation resistance of respirators after multiple cycles of VHP. METHODS: 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) were contaminated with 3 aerosolized bacteriophages: T1, T7, and Pseudomonas phage phi-6 followed by one cycle of VHP decontamination using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA). Additionally, new and unused respirators were sent to an independent laboratory, Nelson Labs (Salt Lake City, UT), for particulate filter penetration testing and inhalation/exhalation resistance after 3 and 5 cycles of VHP. RESULTS: A single VHP cycle resulted in complete eradication of bacteriophage from respirators (limit of detection 10 PFU). Respirators showed acceptable limits for inhalation/exhalation resistance after 3 and 5 cycles of VHP. Respirators demonstrated a filtration efficiency >99 % after 3 cycles, but fell below 95% after 5 cycles of HPV. CONCLUSION: Bioquell VHP demonstrated high viricidal activity for N95 respirators inoculated with aerosolized bacteriophages. Bioquell technology can be scaled for simultaneous decontamination of a large number of used but otherwise intact respirators. Reprocessing should be limited to 3 cycles due to concerns both about impact of clinical wear and tear on fit, and to decrement in filtration after 3 cycles.","output":"Hydrogen Peroxide Vapor Decontamination of N95 Respirators for Reuse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incubation period and generation time are key characteristics in the analysis of infectious diseases. The commonly used contact-tracing-based estimation of incubation distribution is highly influenced by the individuals' judgment on the possible date of exposure, and might lead to significant errors. On the other hand, interval censoring-based methods are able to utilize a much larger set of traveling data but may encounter biased sampling problems. The distribution of generation time is usually approximated by observed serial intervals. However, it may result in a biased estimation of generation time, especially when the disease is infectious during incubation. In this paper, the theory from renewal process is partially adopted by considering the incubation period as the interarrival time, and the duration between departure from Wuhan and onset of symptoms as the mixture of forward time and interarrival time with censored intervals. In addition, a consistent estimator for the distribution of generation time based on incubation period and serial interval is proposed for incubation-infectious diseases. A real case application to the current outbreak of COVID-19 is implemented. We find that the incubation period has a median of 8.50 days (95% confidence interval [CI] [7.22; 9.15]).

Although most studies on protein folding have been conducted in vitro, providing valuable insights, studies on protein folding in crowded intracellular environments are scarce. This study aimed to explore the effects of intracellular molecular crowding on the folding of mutant transactivator HIV-1 Tat based on intracellular interactions, including TAR RNA, as proof of the previously reported chaperna-RNA concept. Considering that the TatCTAR RNA motif binds RNA, we assessed the po tential function of TAR RNA as a chaperna for the refolding of R52Tat, a mutant in which the argi nine (R) residues at R52 have been replaced with alanine (A) by site-directed mutagenesis. We mon itored Tat-EGFP and Tat folding in HeLa cells via time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and biolayer interferometry using EGFP fusion as an indicator for folding status. These results show that the refolding of R52A Tat was stimulated well at a 0.3 M TAR RNA concentration; wild-type Tat refolding was essentially abolished because of a reduction in the affinity for TAR RNA at that con centration. The folding and refolding of R52Tat were mainly promoted upon stimulation with TAR RNA. Our findings provide novel insights into the therapeutic potential of chaperna-mediated fold ing through the examination of as-yet-unexplored RNA-mediated protein folding as well as viral genetic variants that modulate viral evolutionary linkages for viral diseases inside a crowded intra cellular environment.","output":"TAR RNA Mediated Folding of a Single-Arginine-Mutant HIV-1 Tat Protein within HeLa Cells Experiencing Intracellular Crowding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the use of telehealthcare in rheumatology before coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to which future comparisons of newer interventions adapted during the crisis can be made. METHODS: We performed a registered systematic literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and PubMed databases. All full-length articles comparing telehealthcare delivery models with standard care (face-to-face consultation) in the management of patients with rheumatic conditions were assessed for inclusion. RESULTS: A total of 4809 studies were identified; 108 studies were suitable for review by full text, and 13 studies were appropriate to be included in this review. Five studies (38%) included patients with RA, four studies (31%) included patients with mixed disease cohorts, two studies (15%) included patients with OA, one study (8%) included patients with JIA, and one study (8%) included patients with FM. Six studies (46%) used telephone consultation, three studies (23%) used mixed method communication, three studies (23%) used videoconferencing, and one study (8%) used website-delivered telecommunication as their method of telehealthcare delivery. Overall, seven studies (54%) identified the telehealthcare intervention to be an effective method of consultation, and six studies (46%) identified the telehealthcare intervention as non-inferior when compared with standard care. CONCLUSION: Current evidence for telehealthcare in rheumatology is lacking, and the evidence for effectiveness is limited by methodological bias and clinical heterogeneity of telehealthcare interventions, preventing definitive inferences.

Some shutdowns remain in place, yet the extent of the needs of US working parents is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify and address the career development, work culture, and childcare needs of faculty, staff, and trainees at an academic medical center during a pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this survey study, between August 5 and August 20, 2020, a Qualtrics survey was emailed to all faculty, staff, and trainees at University of Utah Health, an academic health care system that includes multiple hospitals, community clinics, and specialty centers. Participants included 27 700 University of Utah Health faculty, staff, and trainees who received a survey invitation. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included experiences of COVID-19 and their associations with career development, work culture, and childcare needs. RESULTS: A total of 5030 participants completed the entire survey (mean [SD] age, 40 [12] years); 3738 (75%) were women; 4306 (86%) were White or European American; 561 (11%) were Latino or Latina (of any race), Black or African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and 301 (6%) were Asian or Asian American. Of the participants, 2545 (51%) reported having clinical responsibilities, 2412 (48%) had at least 1 child aged 18 years or younger, 3316 (66%) were staff, 791 (16%) were faculty, and 640 (13%) were trainees. Nearly one-half of parents reported that parenting (1148 participants [49%]) and managing virtual education for children (1171 participants [50%]) were stressors. Across all participants, 1061 (21%) considered leaving the workforce, and 1505 (30%) considered reducing hours. Four hundred forty-nine faculty (55%) and 397 trainees (60%) perceived decreased productivity, and 2334 participants (47%) were worried about COVID-19 impacting their career development, with 421 trainees (64%) being highly concerned. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey of 5030 faculty, staff, and trainees of a US health system, many participants with caregiving responsibilities, particularly women, faculty, trainees, and (in a subset of cases) those from racial/ethnic groups that underrepresented in medicine, considered leaving the workforce or reducing hours and were worried about their career development related to the pandemic.

The ability of these early infected cells to persist long-term through clonal expansion poses a major barrier to finding a cure.

It is clear from current literature that the provision of feedback by teachers is not sufficient on its own to guarantee improvements as early university entrants may not be sufficiently equipped to effectively engage with feedback. Nonetheless, it is critical for health professional students to develop feedback literacy early, in order to prepare them for a professional career of lifelong learning and critical thinking. The overarching aim of this study was to identify a feasible, sustainable approach to improve feedback literacy among students on pre-qualifying health professional programmes. METHODS: The study was divided into two phases. A mixed-methods approach grounded in constructivism was employed. Participants included teachers and learners from the School of Allied Health at X University, and two internationally acclaimed educationalists. In phase 1, first year students were encouraged to use an established online platform to upload modular feedback and develop personal learning action plans aimed at improving academic performance. A follow-up survey highlighted poor engagement with this method. Thus, the second phase focused on the co-construction of a suite of modules to develop these skills, supported by academic staff. Interviews were conducted with participants to review and refine this initiative. RESULTS: Learners engagement with the first phase of the study was poor. Thus, the second phase provided all stakeholders with the opportunity to feed into the development of a suite of modules, designed to encourage teachers and learners to work in partnership to nurture these skills. All stakeholder groups reported short- and long-term benefits with this approach, but also highlighted challenges towards its implementation. CONCLUSION: The development of feedback literacy among health professional learners is essential. The transferability of such skills has been highlighted in the literature and by all stakeholder groups involved in this study. Finding a balance between introducing these skills at a time early enough to highlight their importance among university entrants is challenging. Further balance must be achieved between the workload required to achieve these skills and current programme demands for both teachers and learners.

In a very short period, the team developed procedures and executed a remote operations readiness test in parallel with the team's support for nominal operations. Continuing regular rover operations with an entirely remote team had not previously been considered feasible due to a variety of factors. These included both the human factors, such as multiple concurrent person-to-person interactions of the uplink planning team, as well as technical factors, such as reliance on powerful workstations dedicated to graphically intensive software tools used for planning. The test was conducted on March 12, 2020, with both the downlink and uplink teams successfully simulating a near full planning day. The JPL administration announced the transition to mandatory telework on Monday, March 16. MSL stood down the uplink planning originally scheduled for the next day while downlink continued monitoring the rover. Full operations then resumed per schedule with nearly the entire operations team teleworking on Friday, March 20, during which the team planned rover activities for three Martian days (sols). These activities included the successful drilling of the 'Edinburgh' rock target, a highly complex robotic arm contact science activity. As of October 1, 2020, the Mars Science Laboratory mission operations team has conducted 88 remote tactical uplink shifts for a total of 190 sols of planned rover activity, which accounts for more than 6% of the mission to date. In this period the rover has completed four drilling campaigns and driven over 1160 meters towards its next major science target - a sulfate bearing geologic unit at the foot of Mount Sharp.

The main objective was to assess the psychological impact of such treatment modifications during the lockdown period for gynaecological and breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentre prospective study was conducted in three university gynaecological cancer wards (Hospices Civils de Lyon, France) during the French first lockdown (16(th) March to 11(th) May 2020). All patients with non-metastatic breast cancer or gynaecological cancer were included. Data was collected regarding treatment modifications (delay, cancellation, change of therapeutic plan). The psychological impact of treatment modifications during and after the lockdown was assessed by validated questionnaires (SF-12, EORTC-QLQ-C30, HADS). RESULTS: A total of 205 consecutive patients were included, aged 60.5 1.0 years. Seven patients (3.4%) presented a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and two patients died. Treatment was maintained for 122 (59.5%) patients, postponed for 72 (35.1%) and cancelled for 11 (5.4%). During the lockdown, 35/118 (29.7%) patients suffered from confirmed anxiety and the mean fatigue-EORTC score was 48.00 2.51; it was 38.64 2.33 (p=0.02) after the lockdown. After the lockdown and compared to the lockdown period, the mental SF-12 score and overall health status EORTC score were significantly higher (45.03 1.06 vs 41.71 1.15, p = 0.02 and 64.58 1.66 vs 57.44 2.02, p=0.0007, respectively). The number of confirmed-anxiety cases was significantly higher among patients for whom treatment was delayed or cancelled (40.5% vs 23.7%, p=0.04).

In healthcare settings, handwashing with alcohol-based hand rubs (ABRH) is recommended before aseptic procedures including intravenous injections. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability, safety and preliminary efficacy of an intervention combining ABHR provision and educational training for PWID. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was used including a pre-post quantitative study and a qualitative study. Participants were active PWID recruited in 4 harm reduction programmes of France and followed up for 6 weeks. After baseline assessment, participants received a face-to-face educational intervention. ABHR was then provided throughout the study period. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaires at baseline, and weeks 2 (W2) and 6 (W6) post-intervention. Qualitative data were collected through focus groups with participants who completed the 6-week study. RESULTS: Among the 59 participants included, 48 (81%) and 43 (73%) attended W2 and W6 visits, respectively. ABHR acceptability was high and adoption rates were 50% (W2) and 61% (W6). Only a minority of participants reported adverse skin reactions (ranging from 2 to 6%). Preliminary efficacy of the intervention was shown through increased hand hygiene frequency (multivariable linear mixed model: coef. W2 = 0.58, p = 0.002; coef. W6 = 0.61, p = 0.002) and fewer self-reported injecting-related infections (multivariable logistic mixed model: AOR W6 = 0.23, p = 0.021).

OBJECTIVES To test whether mitochondrial alarmins are released during VILI, and are associated with lung inflammation. METHODS Release of mitochondrial DNA, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) peptide-dependent neutrophil chemotaxis were measured in conditioned supernatants from human alveolar type II-like (A549) epithelial cells submitted to cyclic stretch in vitro. Similar measurements were performed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from rabbits submitted to an injurious ventilatory regimen, and from patients with ARDS. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Mitochondrial DNA was released by A549 cells during cell stretching, and was found elevated in BAL fluids from rabbits during VILI, and from ARDS patients. Cyclic stretch-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) of A549 cells could be inhibited by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) blockade. ATP concentrations were increased in conditioned supernatants from A549 cells, and in rabbit BAL fluids during VILI. Neutrophil chemotaxis induced by A549 cells conditioned supernatants was essentially dependent on fMLP rather than IL-8. A synergy between cyclic stretch-induced alarmins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found in monocyte-derived macrophages in the production of IL-1?. CONCLUSIONS Mitochondrial alarmins are released during cyclic stretch of human epithelial cells, as well as in BAL fluids from rabbits ventilated with an injurious ventilatory regimen, and found in BAL fluids from ARDS patients, particularly in those with high alveolar inflammation. These alarmins are likely to represent the proximal endogenous mediators of VILI and ARDS, released by injured pulmonary cells.","output":"Mitochondrial alarmins are tissue mediators of ventilator-induced lung injury and ARDS."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For many years, cell-surface glycans (in particular, Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, TACAs) have been the target of both passive and active anticancer immunotherapeutic design. Recent advances in immunotherapy as a treatment for a variety of malignancies has revolutionized anti-tumor treatment regimens. Checkpoint inhibitors, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells, Oncolytic virus therapy, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines have been developed and many approvals have led to remarkable outcomes in a subset of patients. However, many of these therapies are very selective for specific patient populations and hence the search for improved therapeutics and refinement of techniques for delivery are ongoing and fervent research areas. Most of these agents are directed at protein/peptide epitopes, but glycansCbased targets are gaining in popularity, and a handful of approved immunotherapies owe their activity to oligosaccharide targets. In addition, nanotechnology and nanoparticle-derived systems can help improve the delivery of these agents to specific organs and cell types based on tumor-selective approaches.

Epidemiological susceptibility to COVID-19 has been reported in patients with cancer. We aimed to systematically characterise clinical features and determine risk factors of COVID-19 disease severity for patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, we included all adult patients (aged &#8805;18 years) with any type of malignant solid tumours and haematological malignancy who were admitted to nine hospitals in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020. Enrolled patients were statistically matched (2:1) with patients admitted with COVID-19 who did not have cancer with propensity score on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Demographic characteristics, laboratory examinations, illness severity, and clinical interventions were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cancer as well as between patients with cancer with non-severe or severe COVID-19. COVID-19 disease severity was defined on admission on the basis of the WHO guidelines. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type, tumour stage, and antitumour treatments, were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR2000030807. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020, 13a??077 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the nine hospitals in Wuhan and 232 patients with cancer and 519 statistically matched patients without cancer were enrolled. Median follow-up was 29 days (IQR 22-38) in patients with cancer and 27 days (20-35) in patients without cancer. Patients with cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 than patients without cancer (148 [64%] of 232 vs 166 [32%] of 519; odds ratio [OR] 361 [95% CI 259-504]; p<00001). Risk factors previously reported in patients without cancer, such as older age; elevated interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and D-dimer; and reduced lymphocytes were validated in patients with cancer. We also identified advanced tumour stage (OR 260, 95% CI 105-643; p=0039), elevated tumour necrosis factor &#945; (122, 101-147; p=0037), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (165, 103-278; p=0032), reduced CD4+ T cells (084, 071-098; p=0031), and reduced albumin-globulin ratio (012, 002-077; p=0024) as risk factors of COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer and COVID-19 were more likely to deteriorate into severe illness than those without cancer. The risk factors identified here could be helpful for early clinical surveillance of disease progression in patients with cancer who present with COVID-19.

The advent of COVID-19 and the subsequent national lockdown has catapulted higher education institutions into emergency remote teaching (ERT). A principal challenge in this shift is the ability to stimulate student interest towards engagement with, and retention of, course content. The creation of teaching and learning (T&L) resources and activities using a combination of the visual, aural, read/write and kinaesthetic (VARK) modes is fundamental in ensuring student engagement. Objectives. To determine the learning style profiles of undergraduate students and to explore how student learning profiles may be incorporated in T&L approaches during ERT. Methods. This descriptive study profiles the learning preferences of undergraduate students in a health science faculty using the VARK questionnaire. The study further outlines modifications in T&L implemented to support the varied learning preferences during the COVID-19 ERT response. Results. Our findings demonstrate that the majority of our students have a multimodal learning preference, with the kinaesthetic modality being the most preferred. Voice-over PowerPoint presentations with transitioning images, and audio files, supported the visual and aural learners through asynchronous engagement. Additionally, online discussion forums and applied projects (such as theme park designs) enhanced asynchronous learning by stimulating the visual, read/write and kinaesthetic preferences, respectively. Microsoft Team sessions with PowerPoint presentations supported visual and aural learning preferences through synchronous engagement. Conclusions. Rethinking traditional T&L approaches towards supporting the diverse student learning preferences is critical in student-centred T&L amidst the many challenges that ERT has precipitated. Academics need to be dynamic in their T&L approaches and intuitive in their awareness of how subject content may be modified/enhanced in the ERT environment.

Now, as the time is passing, many issues related to co-infections/secondary infections/superinfections in COVID-19 patients are emerging. The literature is getting enriched everyday by addition of reports from all over the world for the same. The purpose of this review is to decipher the plethora of fungal infections in COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 infection along with it brought many risk factors namely lung injury, immunosuppression, need for oxygen therapy, monoclonal antibodies, steroid therapy, etc. which are known predisposing factors for fungal infections. Rather the extent and severity of fungal pathogens has been so much that it has led to new terminologies like CAC (COVID-19-associated Candida), CAPA (COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis) and CAM (COVID-19-associated mucormycosis). There is increase in invasiveness of Candida, prevalence of aspergillosis in COVID-19 damaged lung and outbreak of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients resulting in double trouble, keeping laboratory personnel, clinicians, and intensivists on their toes in managing these patients. SUMMARY: Awareness and understanding regarding these possible complications is necessary to decrease the morbidity and mortality among patients. The COVID-19 and fungal coinfections may bring more insight into ways of pathogenesis of fungal infections, need for better antifungal agents, quick diagnostic modalities, and better management policies in the near future.","output":"COVID-19 and Plethora of Fungal Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Small case series have evaluated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-detection in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or RNA-in situ hybridization (RNAish). OBJECTIVE: To compare droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), IHC, and RNAish to detect SARS-CoV-2 in FFPE tissue in a large series of lung specimens from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. DESIGN: ddPCR and RNAish used commercially available probes; IHC utilized clone 1A9. Twenty-six autopsies of COVID-19 patients with FFPE tissue blocks of 62 lung specimens, 22 heart specimens, 2 brain specimens, and 1 liver, and 1 umbilical cord were included. Control cases included 9 autopsy lungs from patients with other infections/inflammation and virus-infected tissue or cell lines. RESULTS: ddPCR had the highest sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 (96%) when compared to IHC (31%) and RNAish (36%). All 3 tests had a specificity of 100%. Agreement between ddPCR and IHC or RNAish was fair (&#954;=0.23, &#954;=0.35, respectively). Agreement between IHC and ISH was substantial (&#954;=0.75). Interobserver reliability was almost perfect for IHC (&#954;=0.91) and fair to moderate for RNAish (&#954;=0.38-0.59). Lung tissues from patients who died earlier after onset of symptoms revealed higher copy numbers by ddPCR (P=.03, pearson corr = -0.65) and were more likely to be positive by RNAish (P=.02) than lungs from patients who died later. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in hyaline membranes, pneumocytes, and rarely in respiratory epithelium. ddPCR showed low copy numbers in 7 autopsy hearts from ProteoGenex Inc. All other extrapulmonary tissues were negative. CONCLUSIONS: ddPCR was the most sensitive and highly specific test to identify SARS-CoV-2 in lung specimens from COVID-19 patients.","output":"Comparison of In Situ Hybridization, Immunohistochemistry and Reverse Transcription-Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2)-Testing in Tissue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World Health Organization (WHO) has prioritized the infectious emerging diseases such as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in terms of research and development of effective tests, vaccines, antivirals, and other treatments.

METHODS: Food as Medicine Phase II is a pilot study that measured the effectiveness of incorporating precision nutrition to improve chronic disease management in a cohort of 24 low income African Americans with either pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, elevated blood cholesterol levels, obesity or a combination of these disorders. Anthropometric measures and a food questionnaire were collected pre/post study. DNA samples were obtained from each participant and analyzed at Howard University on SNPs related to nutrient metabolism. Results from the DNA tests were incorporated in a detailed personal nutrition plan developed for each participant. Plans were presented and discussed during an initial individual face-to-face counseling session. Due to COVID 19, a second counseling session was conducted via Zoom. For three months after the 2nd counseling session, participants received weekly text messages reinforcing the information received. RESULTS: Participants reported significant improvements in their intake of most recommended foods. Reductions in weight, waist circumference, and in the reported intake of non-recommended foods and beverages were not significant. Most participants either strongly agreed (14) or agreed (4) that the personalized nutrition plan provided useful information. The coronavirus pandemic was mentioned by 20% of participants as a barrier to following their personalized nutrition plan recommendations.

At the first stage, this system runs our proposed image processing algorithm that analyzes the view of the lung to discard those CT images that inside the lung is not properly visible in them.

At the next stage, we introduce a novel architecture for improving the classification accuracy of convolutional networks on images containing small important objects. Our architecture applies a new feature pyramid network designed for classification problems to the ResNet50V2 model so the model becomes able to investigate different resolutions of the image and do not lose the data of small objects. As the infections of COVID-19 exist in various scales, especially many of them are tiny, using our method helps to increase the classification performance remarkably.

The urgent needs for exploring the neutralizing antibodies from patients with different clinical characteristics are emerging. METHODS: A total of 117 blood samples were collected from 70 COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients. Antibodies were determined with a modified cytopathogenic neutralization assay (NA) based on live SARS-CoV-2 and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The dynamics of neutralizing antibody levels at different time points with different clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The seropositivity rate reached up to 100.0% within 20 days since onset, and remained 100.0% till day 41-53. The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6) by NA and 1:12441.7 (95% CI, 9754.5 to 15869.2) by ELISA. The antibody level by NA and ELISA peaked on day 31-40 since onset, and then decreased slightly. In multivariate GEE analysis, patients at age of 31-45, 46-60, and 61-84 had a higher neutralizing antibody level than those at age of 16-30 (?=1.0470, P=0.0125; ?=1.0613, P=0.0307; ?=1.3713, P=0.0020).

The volumes were assessed by (1) Imaging indication: cancer screening, initial workup, active cancer, and surveillance; (2) Care setting: outpatient and inpatient, ED; (3) Hospital type: quaternary academic center (QAC), university\\\\affiliated community hospital (UACH), and sole community hospitals (SCHs). RESULTS: During the COVID\\\\19 peak, a significant drop in CT volumes was observed (?42.2%, p < 0.0001), with cancer screening, initial workup, active cancer, and cancer surveillance declining by 81.7%, 54.8%, 30.7%, and 44.7%, respectively (p < 0.0001).

Bilateral salpingectomy (BS) has recently been introduced as an alternative due to possibly superior contraception and greater protection against ovarian cancer. AIMS The aim of this study is to assess uptake, feasibility and perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic BS as an alternative to tubal occlusion in Australia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of permanent female contraception at two Australian hospitals from January 2014 through December 2020 was performed. The primary outcome was the uptake of BS. Secondary outcomes were feasibility, procedure length, number of ports, perioperative complications and admission length. RESULTS A total of 414 women were included; 92 (22.2%) underwent BS and 322 (77.8%) underwent tubal occlusion. There was a slow uptake of BS from 2014 to 2016 (0-3.2%), with a steep uptake from 2017 to 2020 (30-72%) (P = 0.001). Procedure feasibility was 96.8% (62/64) and 99.3% (282/284) for BS and tubal occlusion group, respectively (P = 0.64). BS procedure time was longer by 23 min (P < 0.001). Three or more surgical ports were used in all cases of BS compared to 4.5% of the tubal occlusion group (P < 0.001). There were no intraoperative complications. There were nine and six postoperative complications in the tubal occlusion versus BS group, respectively (P = 0.10). The median admission length was 7.1 (tubal occlusion) versus 7.3 (BS) h (P = 0.10), with five unintended overnight admissions. CONCLUSION BS is an increasing choice for permanent contraception. It appears equally feasible as tubal occlusion but typically requires a longer procedure time and a minimum of three surgical ports.","output":"A retrospective cohort study of tubal occlusion or salpingectomy for permanent contraception in Australia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 saw a seismic change in General Practice with significant clinical, operational and educational challenges across the whole of the primary care team.

Characteristics at admission were analysed to identify factors predictive of unfavourable outcome using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Based on the results, a nomogram to predict 14-day probability of poor outcome was proposed. RESULTS: Between March 15th and April 14th, 2020, 279 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized after a median of 7 days after the first symptoms. Among them, 88 (31.5%) patients had an unfavourable outcome: 48 were admitted to the ICU for artificial ventilation, and 40 patients died without being admitted to ICU. Multivariable analyses retained age, overweight, polypnoea, fever, high C-reactive protein, elevated us troponin-I, and lymphopenia as risk factors of an unfavourable outcome.

To identify mechanisms and discover cardio-protective drugs, we use a state-of-the-art pipeline combining human cardiac organoids with high throughput phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing. We identify that cytokine-storm induced diastolic dysfunction can be caused by a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1 and poly(I:C) and also human COVID-19 serum. Bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) is activated along with pathology driving fibrotic and induced nitric oxide synthase genes. BRD inhibitors fully recover function in hCO and totally prevent death in a cytokine-storm mouse model. BRD inhibition decreases transcription of multiple genes, including fibrotic, induced nitric oxide synthase and ACE2, and prevention of cardiac infection with SARS-CoV2. Thus, BRD inhibitors are promising candidates to prevent COVID-19 mediated cardiac damage.Funding: We acknowledge grant and fellowship support from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (J.E.H., M.J.S., C.R.E., T.B.), Heart Foundation of Australia (J.E.H.), QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute (J.E.H.), The Stafford Fox Foundation (E.R.P.), the Royal Childrens Hospital Foundation (E.R.P.), Australian Research Council Strategic Initiative in Stem Cell Science (Stem Cells Australia) (E.R.P. and J.E.H.) and the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF9200008) (J.E.H., T.B., M.J.S., K.P.A.MD., C.R.E., E.R.P.).

These receptors are highly expressed in heart, lungs, respiratory tract epithelium, endothelial cells and brain. Since an increasing body of significant evidence is highlighting a possible neuroinvasion related to SARS-CoV-2, a state of the art on the neurological complications is needed. To identify suitable publications, our systematic review was carried out by searching relevant studies on PubMed and Scopus databases. We included studies investigating neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in patients over 18. According to the analyzed studies, the most frequent disorders affecting central nervous system (CNS) seem to be the following: olfactory and taste disorders, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, meningoencephalitis and encephalopathy, including acute necrotizing encephalopathy, a rare type of encephalopathy. As regards the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Guillain-Barr and Miller Fisher syndromes are the most frequent manifestations reported in the literature.

Due to their widespread use in sport fisheries of the Laurentian Great Lakes, there are increasing concerns that baitfish may introduce or disseminate fish pathogens. In this study, we evaluated whether baitfish purchased from 78 randomly selected retail bait dealers in Michigan harbored fish viruses. Between September 2015 and June 2016, 5,400 baitfish divided into 90 lots of 60 fish were purchased. Fish were tested for the presence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), golden shiner reovirus (GSRV), fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV), fathead minnow picornavirus (FHMPV), and white sucker bunyavirus (WSBV). Using the epithelioma papulosum cyprini cell line and molecular confirmation, we demonstrated the presence of viruses in 18 of the 90 fish lots (20.0%) analyzed. The most prevalent virus was FHMNV, being detected in 6 of 30 lots of Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas and 3 of 42 lots of Emerald Shiners Notropis atherinoides. We also confirmed GSRV in two fish species: the Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas (5 of 11 lots) and Fathead Minnow (3 of 30 lots). Two VHSV (genotype IVb) isolates were recovered from a single lot of Emerald Shiners. No SVCV, FHMPV, or WSBV was detected in any of the fish examined. Some of the infected fish exhibited clinical signs and histopathological alterations.

METHODS: A retrospective, multicentre cohort study of 154 UK hospitals that participate in the National Cardiac Arrest Audit and have intensive care units participating in the Case Mix Programme national audit of intensive care. Hospital burden of COVID-19 was defined by the number of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection admitted to critical care per 10,000 hospital admissions. RESULTS: 16,474 patients with IHCA where a resuscitation team attended were included. Patients admitted to hospital during 2020 were younger, more often male, and of non-white ethnicity compared with 2016-2019. A decreasing trend in IHCA rates between 2016 and 2019 was reversed in 2020. Hospitals with higher burden of COVID-19 had the greatest difference in IHCA rates (21.8 per 10,000 admissions in April 2020 vs 14.9 per 10,000 in April 2019). The proportions of patients achieving ROSC20 min and surviving to hospital discharge were lower in 2020 compared with 2016-19 (46.2% vs 51.2%; and 21.9% vs 22.9%, respectively). Among patients with IHCA, higher hospital burden of COVID-19 was associated with reduced survival to hospital discharge (OR=0.95; 95% CI 0.93 to 0.98; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with 2016C2019, the first COVID-19 wave in 2020 was associated with a higher rate of IHCA and decreased survival among patients attended by resuscitation teams.

In addition to OSNs, the antenna also hosts various support cell types. These include the triad of trichogen, tormogen and thecogen support cells that lie adjacent to their respective OSNs. The arrangement of OSN supporting cells occurs stereotypically for all sensilla and is widely conserved in evolution. While insect chemosensory neurons have received considerable attention, little is known about the functional significance of the cells that support them. For instance, it remains unknown whether support cells play an active role in odor detection, or only passively contribute to homeostasis, e.g. by maintaining sensillum lymph composition. To investigate the functional interaction between OSNs and support cells, we used optical and electrophysiological approaches in Drosophila. First, we characterized the distribution of various supporting cells using genetic markers. By means of an ex vivo antennal preparation and genetically-encoded Ca2+ and K+ indicators, we then studied the activation of these auxiliary cells during odor presentation in adult flies. We observed acute responses and distinct differences in Ca2+ and K+ fluxes between support cell types. Finally, we observed alterations in OSN responses upon thecogen cell ablation in mature adults. Upon inducible ablation of thecogen cells, we notice a gain in mechanical responsiveness to mechanical stimulations during single-sensillum recording, but a lack of change to neuronal resting activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that support cells play a more active and responsive role during odor processing than previously thought. Our observations thus reveal that support cells functionally interact with OSNs and may be important for the extraordinary ability of insect olfactory systems to dynamically and sensitively discriminate between odors in the turbulent sensory landscape of insect flight.","output":"Functional interaction between Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons and their support cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 as a pandemic, the government has forced the nationwide shutdown of several activities, including educational activities.

In cats with FIP, 95% of tissue, and 81% of faecal samples were PCR-positive, as opposed to 22% of tissue, and 60% of faecal samples in cats without FIP. Relative FCoV copy numbers were significantly higher in the cats with FIP, both in tissues (P < 0.001) and faeces (P = 0.02).

Since this hypothesis alone does not fully explain why specific subgroups of patients are at major risk, we hypothesized that obesity may be one of the links between COVID-19 severity and high level of air pollution. First, obesity is a predisposing factor for SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse COVID-19 outcomes, and unequivocal evidence demonstrated that fat mass excess is independently associated with several pulmonary diseases and lung inflammation. Moreover, it has been shown that obesity may intensify the detrimental effects of air pollution on the lungs, and this is not surprising if we consider that these conditions share an excessive activation of the immune system and a lung inflammatory infiltrate. Finally, fat mass excess has also been speculated to be itself a consequence of air pollutants exposure, which has been proved to induce metabolic disruption and weight gain in murine models. In conclusion, although many variables must be taken into account in the analysis of the pandemic, our observations suggest that obesity may act as effect modifier of smog-induced lung-injury, and the concomitant presence of these two factors could better explain the higher virulence, faster spread and greater mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern Italy compared to the rest of the country.","output":"Is obesity the missing link between COVID-19 severity and air pollution?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificial intelligence has been used in the medical field for many years finding its way in assisting medical professionals to solve complex tasks in almost every application domain.

Not surprisingly, these actions directly impacted demand for nonessential goods and services, but the full impact of this shock on the broader economy will depend on the nature and strength of value chains. In a world where production chains are increasingly fragmented, a shock in one industry (or a group of industries) in one country will affect other domestic industries as well as international trade, leading to impacts on production in other countries. We employ the World InputCOutput Database to depict the interdependencies among both industries and countries, which provides a full representation of global value chains. By assuming a homogeneous impact on demand for nonessential goods and services around the world, we demonstrate asymmetric effects on production by industry and international trade, leading to asymmetric relative impacts on national economies. Our results indicate that if demand for nonessential goods and services decreases by 50%, the global gross domestic product will decline by 23%, leading to relative impacts that are larger in China, Indonesia, and some European countries.

(2012) Prevention of influenza among travellers attending at a UK travel clinic: beliefs and perceptions. A cross\\\\sectional study. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(4), 574C583. Background Travellers compliance with measures to prevent influenza through the use of antivirals and influenza vaccine remains very poor despite influenza being one of the commonest travel and vaccine\\\\preventable diseases. A study was undertaken to assess travellers beliefs, perceptions and intentions to take antivirals for the treatment and prevention of influenza during the H1N1 pandemic. Methods A cross\\\\sectional survey (n = 96) of travellers who attended the Royal Free Travel Health Centre, London, UK was undertaken in September 2009. A self\\\\administered questionnaire was completed by a traveller in advance of their pre\\\\travel health consultation. Logistic regression identified variables independently associated with compliance. Results Influenza vaccination uptake for the 5 years preceding the study was found to be 208%. This was statistically significantly higher for older travellers and those with underlying health conditions (P < 0005). Mean intention to comply with antiviral drugs on a preventive and therapeutic basis was 58% and 72%, respectively, and this varied markedly with age and with dispensed antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Conclusion This study identifies some beliefs and perceptions travellers consider with regard to the therapeutic and preventive influenza use of antivirals during the H1N1 pandemic; it underscores the importance of travellers receiving hemisphere appropriate influenza vaccination. The external validity of these study findings requires further corroboration involving other travel clinics and different cohorts of travellers during seasonal activity or outbreaks of influenza. These findings could guide the development of future strategies for the prevention of influenza in travellers.","output":"Prevention of influenza among travellers attending at a UK travel clinic: beliefs and perceptions.

However, limited data are available comparing these cough simulations to physiological breathing and coughing. In this study, three different cough simulators (Teleflex Mucosal Atomization Device Nasal (MAD Nasal), a spray gun, and GloGerm(TM) MIST) that have been used in the literature were studied to assess their physiologic relevance. Droplet size, velocity, dispersion, and force generated by the simulators were measured. Droplet size was measured with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Slow-motion videography was used to 3D reconstruct and measure the velocity of each simulated cough. A force-sensitive resistor was used to measure the force of each simulated cough. The average size of droplets from each cough simulator was 176 to 220 m. MAD Nasal, the spray gun, and GloGerm(TM) MIST traveled 0.38 m, 0.89 m, and 1.62 m respectively. The average velocities for the MAD Nasal, spray gun, and GloGerm(TM) MIST were 1.57 m/s, 2.60 m/s, and 9.27 m/s respectively, and all yielded a force of <0.5 Newtons. GloGerm(TM) MIST and the spray gun most closely resemble physiological coughs and breathing respectively. In conclusion, none of the simulators tested accurately modeled all physiologic characteristics (droplet size, 3-D dispersion velocity, and force) of a cough, while there were various strengths and weaknesses of each method.

The goal of the project was to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of our approaches in meeting <797> requirements. METHODS USP <797> standards, radiation safety concerns, and work-flow patterns were the focal points in our assessment of 4 laboratories: 2 nuclear pharmacy laboratories that engage in preparing sterile (low-, medium-, and high-risk levels), nonsterile, or possible hazardous radioactive drugs and 2 other laboratories in which only low-risk-level preparations are involved. RESULTS Each laboratory was constructed with a physically separated International Organization for Standardization Class 7 anteroom and clean room to allow us to maintain an appropriate air quality, a consistent operation, and a desirable flexibility. An isolated area within the laboratory was designated for preparing nonsterile products. Higher air change per hour was used in the areas with higher traffic or smaller space. Lead-lined biological safety cabinets (BSCs) were segregated and used depending on the risk category of the preparations. In 1 laboratory, the exhaust flow for the BSC was too great, and a lead-lined compounding aseptic containment isolator (CACI) was installed. Air in the BSC and CACI was 100% exhausted to the atmosphere. 99Mo/99mTc generators were placed in the negative-pressure clean room to ensure a more efficient operation and cleaner air environment. Clean-room equipment (i.e., keyboards, printers, and telephones) was installed, and refrigerators or freezers and the central-processing unit of each computer were placed outside clean room.

The clinical, laboratory, imaging, and mortality data of patients admitted at a COVID service of the Santa Rosa de Piura Hospital were recorded from April to June 2020. RESULTS Data from 391 patients with a median age of 60 years (70% women) was gathered. The time lapse between the onset of the disease and hospitalization was seven days. The most common alteration in the blood count was Neutrophilia in 78% of patients. The median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 77. The distribution of tomographic patterns was Ground glass in 91% of patients, interstitial involvement in 57%, consolidation in 43%.

This report highlights a unique case of meningitis after CSF leak caused by ruptured congenital meningocele during a routine nasopharyngeal swab. Case Report: A 54-year-old female with diagnosed CSF leak presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of severe headache, and neck and back pain. Prior to this presentation, the patient had experienced two months of persistent headache and rhinorrhea since her coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nasopharyngeal swab. As part of her outpatient workup, an otolaryngology consultation with subsequent beta-2 transferrin testing and magnetic resonance imaging was performed and she was diagnosed with a CSF leak from ruptured congenital meningocele. On ED presentation, she was afebrile, but with mild tachycardia, leukocytosis, and meningismus. Lumbar puncture revealed acute streptococcal meningitis. This patients meningitis developed due to prolonged occult CSF leak after her COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab ruptured a pre-existing congenital meningocele. Conclusion: Nasopharyngeal swabs are being performed much more frequently due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(mRNA-1273). DLS plays an important role in the characterization and quality control of nanoparticle-based therapeutics and vaccines. However, most DLS instruments have a single detection angle theta, and the amplitude of the scattering vector, q, varies among them according to the relationship q = (4 pi n/lambda (0)) sin(theta/2), where lambda (0) is the laser wavelength. Results for identical, polydisperse samples among instruments of varying q yield different hydrodynamic diameters, because, as particles become larger they scatter less light at higher q, so that higher-q instruments will under-sample large particles in polydisperse populations, and report higher z-average diffusion coefficients, and hence smaller effective hydrodynamic diameters than lower-q instruments. As particle size reaches the Mie regime the scattering envelope manifests angular maxima and minima, and the monotonic decrease of average size versus q is lost. The discrepancy among instruments of different q is hence fundamental, and not merely technical. This work examines results for different q-value instruments, using mixtures of monodisperse latex sphere standards, for which experimental measurements agree well with computations, and also polydisperse solutions of physically-degraded LNPs, for which results follow expected trends. Mie effects on broad unimodal populations are also considered. There is no way to predict results between two instruments with different q for samples of unknown particle size distributions.

The KEAP1-NRF2 system plays a central role in the regulation of redox balance, and NRF2 activation exerts antiaging effects by controlling oxidative stress in aged tissues. -Klotho was identified as an aging suppressor protein based on the premature aging phenotypes of its mutant mice, and its expression is known to gradually decrease during aging. Because -Klotho has been shown to possess antioxidant function, aging-related phenotypes of -Klotho mutant mice seem to be attributable to increased oxidative stress at least in part. To examine whether NRF2 activation antagonizes aging-related phenotypes caused by -Klotho deficiency, we crossed -Klotho-deficient (Kl-/-) mice with a Keap1-knockdown background, in which the NRF2 pathway is constitutively activated in the whole body. NRF2 pathway activation in Kl-/- mice extended the lifespan and dramatically improved aging-related renal phenotypes. With elevated expression of antioxidant genes accompanied by an oxidative stress decrease, the antioxidant effects of NRF2 seem to make a major contribution to the attenuation of aging-related renal phenotypes of Kl-/- mice. Thus, NRF2 is expected to exert an antiaging function by partly compensating for the functional decline of -Klotho during physiological aging.","output":"NRF2 Pathway Activation Attenuates Aging-Related Renal Phenotypes due to -Klotho Deficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an ongoing problem in more than 200 countries in the world.

Some descriptors, namely the interaction potentials per single protein and global potentials, were calculated in this work. These descriptors, evaluated for the closed and open states of the spike protein, are correlated to the long-range noncovalent interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spikes and polymeric surfaces. They are associated with the surface's affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 dispersed in respiratory droplets or water solutions. Molecular-Dynamics simulations were performed to model the surface of three synthetic polymeric materials: Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), and Polylactic Acid (PLA), used in Molecular Mechanics simulations to define the above potentials. The descriptors show a similar trend for the three surfaces, highlighting a greater affinity towards the spikes of PP and PLA over PET. For closed and open structures, the long-range interactions with the surfaces decreased in the following order PPPLA>PET and PLA>PP>PET, respectively. Thus, PLA and PP interact with the virion quite distant from these surfaces to a greater extent concerning the PET surface, however, the differences among the considered surfaces were small. The global potentials show that the long-range interactions are weak compared to classic binding energy of covalent or ionic bonds.

In the 6-month double-blind period (DBP) of ILLUMINATE-A, a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with PH1 6 years old, treatment with lumasiran, an RNA interference therapeutic, led to substantial reductions in urinary oxalate (UOx) levels. METHODS: We report data to month 12 in the extension period (EP) of ILLUMINATE-A, including patients who continued lumasiran (lumasiran/lumasiran) or crossed over from placebo to lumasiran (placebo/lumasiran). RESULTS: In the lumasiran/lumasiran group (n = 24), the reduction in 24-hour UOx level was sustained to month 12 (mean reduction from baseline, 66.9% at month 6; 64.1% at month 12). The placebo/lumasiran group (n = 13) had a similar time course and magnitude of 24-hour UOx reduction (mean reduction, 57.3%) after 6 months of lumasiran. Kidney stone event rates seemed to be lower after 6 months of lumasiran in both groups compared with the 12 months before consent, and this reduction was maintained at month 12 in the lumasiran/lumasiran group. At study start, 71% of patients in the lumasiran/lumasiran group and 92% in the placebo/lumasiran group had nephrocalcinosis. Nephrocalcinosis grade improved after 6 months of lumasiran in the lumasiran/lumasiran and placebo/lumasiran groups (13% and 8% of patients, respectively). After an additional 6 months of lumasiran, 46% of patients had improvement in nephrocalcinosis grade within the lumasiran/lumasiran group. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) remained stable during the course of lumasiran treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) related to lumasiran were mild, transient injection-site reactions (ISRs). CONCLUSION: Long-term lumasiran treatment enabled sustained lowering of UOx levels with acceptable safety and encouraging results on clinical outcomes.","output":"Randomized Clinical Trial on the Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Lumasiran in Patients With Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Baby wipes are a commonly used cleansing method for infants.

Extract of cactus cladodes (Opuntia ficus indica) was given to MTX-treated rats (0.4 g/kg). Spermatozoa were collected from cauda epididymis and analyzed for sperm count and motility. Testis samples were used for histopathological and oxidative stress studies (assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, protein carbonyls (PCs), catalase (CAT) glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities). Moreover, levels of testosterone were measured in serum by radioimmunoassay. Our results showed that MTX had destructive effects on sperm count and motility associated with significant decrease in testosterone levels in MTX group. This effect was then confirmed by docking results. Testis of MTX group showed increased oxidative stress status. In fact, PCs and MDA were increased and CAT, GPx and SOD were decreased suggesting increased reactive oxygen species and deficiency in enzymatic antioxidant. These findings were associated with disrupted testicular morphology as assessed by histological study. Cladodes extract had protective effects on rat's gonad histology, oxidative stress and improve both sperm parameters (count and motility) and serum testosterone levels.

AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between social support and anxiety, and the mediating effect of risk perception during the COVID-19 epidemic in the third trimester pregnant women in Qingdao, China. METHODS: From 16 to 21 February 2020, an online survey was conducted, which collected the information on demographic data, anxiety, social support and risk perception to COVID-19 of women with established medical records in the ambulatory of the Department of Obstetrics at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Anxiety was assessed by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), social support was assessed by the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and risk perception was assessed by a self-designed questionnaire. RESULTS: This study had 308 participants with an average of 31.02  3.91 years. During the period of prevention and control of the epidemic, most pregnant women adopted protective measures, such as wearing masks (97.4%), washing hands frequently (88.3%) and staying at home (76.3%). The average SAS, SSRS and risk perception scores of the participants were 42.45  6.98, 44.60  7.00 and 21.60  5.74, respectively. The total effect of maternal social support on anxiety was -2.63 (95% confidence interval (CI): -4.40 ~ -1.44, p < .001), the direct effect was -1.44 (95% CI: -2.74 ~ -0.35, p < .05) and the indirect effect was -1.19 (95% CI: -2.49 ~ -0.51, p < .001).

However, the formation of O(2-n)- (0<n<2) species and even oxygen gas during the deep oxidation stage lead to progressive structural transformation that cause the voltage decay / hysteresis, sluggish kinetics and poor thermo-stability, preventing the real-world application of LLOs. Therefore, the substantive key relies in enhancing the anionic redox stability in LLOs. Here, we have purposed a sulfuration procedure of LLOs (S-LLOs), in which sulfur anions incorporate into oxygen sites in the lattice structure and form polyanions on the surface. Proved by structural characterizations and DFT calculations, sulfur anions in the interior lattice can reversibly participate in the redox process and enhance the integral coordination stability by mitigating undesired oxygen redox. Moreover, S polyanions at surface form a protecting layer for interfacial stability. The electrochemical measurements indicate that S-LLO demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 307.8 mAhg-1 , an outstanding capacity retention rate of 91.5% after 200 cycles, along with excellent voltage maintenance, rate capability and thermo-stability. The sulfuration process of LLOs with multi-anionic redox mechanism highlights a promising strategy to design novel high-energy-density cathode materials with superior cycling performance.

In the present study, we investigated the role of autophagy in coxsackievirus replication. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a picornavirus associated with viral myocarditis, causes pronounced intracellular membrane reorganization after infection. We demonstrate that CVB3 infection induces an increased number of double-membrane vesicles, accompanied by an increase of the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and an accumulation of punctate GFP-LC3-expressing cells, two hallmarks of cellular autophagosome formation. However, protein expression analysis of p62, a marker for autophagy-mediated protein degradation, showed no apparent changes after CVB3 infection. These results suggest that CVB3 infection triggers autophagosome formation without promoting protein degradation by the lysosome. We further examined the role of the autophagosome in CVB3 replication. We demonstrated that inhibition of autophagosome formation by 3-methyladenine or small interfering RNAs targeting the genes critical for autophagosome formation (ATG7, Beclin-1, and VPS34 genes) significantly reduced viral replication. Conversely, induction of autophagy by rapamycin or nutrient deprivation resulted in increased viral replication. Finally, we examined the role of autophagosome-lysosome fusion in viral replication. We showed that blockage of the fusion by gene silencing of the lysosomal protein LAMP2 significantly promoted viral replication. Taken together, our results suggest that the host's autophagy machinery is activated during CVB3 infection to enhance the efficiency of viral replication.","output":"Autophagosome supports coxsackievirus B3 replication in host cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surveys that have recruited participants through social media and news websites have led researchers and clinicians to conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a parallel pandemic of nightmares that reflect pandemic-induced psychological distress.

Indeed, it is known that viral infections can be act as triggers for IBD flare and it is reasonable that the possible drug discontinuation during SARS-CoV-2 infection could in turn lead to an IBD flare. Methods: This was a prospective, observational case-control study. From March 11th 2020 to June 30th 2020 we enrolled IBD patients with proven SARS-Cov-2 infection (cases) and IBD patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection matched for sex, age, diagnosis, therapy and clinical activity (controls). Cases and controls were followed-up at least for 6 months. Differences between case and control group were tested for significance using the Students t test and Fishers test, as appropriate. A two-tailed p value < 0.05 was indicative of statistical significance. Results: 219 IBD patients (127 UC, 58.0%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 219 IBD patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Table 1 shows baseline features of the population. Among the 122 cases in clinical remission at the time of viral infection, 28 (22.9%) showed a disease flare;this percentage was significantly higher than that observed in controls: 12/137 (8.8%)(p=0.0018). Among patients with disease flare, there were no significant differences between cases and controls group in terms of age (42.3  16.0 vs. 43.1  15.4 years, p=0.44), gender (female 45.7% vs. 48.2%, p= 0.54), use of biologic therapies (p=0.83) and UC or CD diagnosis (p=0.06).

RESULTS The mean number of daily new patient applications to the outpatient clinic (9.873.87 vs 6.434.03, p<0.001) and OPC clinic (3.871.49 vs 1.131.46, p<0.001) was significantly reduced compared with the previous years. While the number of inpatient admissions was similar for a month frame, the median duration of hospitalisation was significantly reduced. The frequency of hospitalisations for chemotherapy was higher than in previous years (p<0.001). By comparison, the rate of hospitalisations for palliative care (p=0.028) or elective interventional procedures (p=0.001) was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION In our experience, almost all domains of care were affected during the pandemic other than patients' systemic treatments. There were significant drops in the numbers of newly diagnosed patients, patients having interventional procedures and palliative care services, and these problems should be the focus points for the risk mitigation efforts for prevention of care disruptions.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic: changes in cancer admissions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization announced the new coronavirus disease 2019 as a pandemic, as of March 11, 2020. The long-expected method to combat coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, that is, using an effective and widely available vaccine, has become reality by late 2020. This study was conducted prior to the national coronavirus disease 2019 mass vaccination campaign in Turkey to investigate the individual thoughts, behaviors, and expectations of the academic personnel on coronavirus disease 2019 vac- cination practices, who were among the pionneers in both vaccine trials and real-time coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine jabs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Hacettepe University Medical School has a total of 1692 academic personnel. All academicians were reached through their academic email addresses and invited to participate in the survey. Busy academic routines and coronavirus disease 2019-related duties limited response number to 213 academicians, after 3 consecutive reminders at 1 week interval. The survey was conducted using a standardized, 14 question-long questionnaire, using Google forms. RESULTS: Of the 213 participants, 60.6% (n = 129) were females and the average age ( standard deviation) was 40.2  12.0 years. Of all, 17.4% (n = 37) had been reportedly diagnosed to have coronavirus disease 2019 prior to vaccination. A statistically significant posi- tive association was detected between coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination self-experience and recommending such a vaccination for relatives (P < .001); odds of recommendation was 19.5 times (95% CI = 4.2-89.6) higher among coronavirus disease 2019 vaccinated academicians compared to their non-vaccinated counterparts. CONCLUSION: Study participants are amongs the frontline workers, with expectedly the highest exposure rates from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. A significant proportion of academicians also play important role as scientific consultants and role models for the general public. Thus, their thoughts and concerns regarding public preventive measures and coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination practices are important for decisions health policy makers and administrators in charge of vaccine selection, availabil- ity, distribution, and allocation make, besides their self-responsibility in provision of evidence-based vaccine information for the general public, based on local needs and concerns.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccination-Related Thoughts, Behaviors, and Expectations of the Academic Personnel in Hacettepe University Medical School"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to evaluate various methods of chest compressions in patients with suspected/confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conducted by medical students wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE) for aerosol generating procedures (AGP). METHODS This was prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blinded, crossover simulation trial. Thirty-five medical students after an advanced cardiovascular life support course, which included performing 2-min continuous chest compression scenarios using 3 methods: (A) manual chest compression (CC), (B) compression with CPRMeter, (C) compression with LifeLine ARM device. During resuscitation they are wearing full personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures. RESULTS The median chest compression depth using manual CC, CPRMeter and LifeLine ARM varied and amounted to 40 (38-45) vs. 45 (40-50) vs. 51 (50-52) mm, respectively (p = 0.002). The median chest compression rate was 109 (IQR; 102-131) compressions per minute (CPM) for manual CC, 107 (105-127) CPM for CPRMeter, and 102 (101-102) CPM for LifeLine ARM (p = 0.027). The percentage of correct chest recoil was the highest for LifeLine ARM - 100% (95-100), 80% (60-90) in CPRMeter group, and the lowest for manual CC - 29% (26-48). CONCLUSIONS According to the results of this simulation trial, automated chest compression devices (ACCD) should be used for chest compression of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. In the absence of ACCD, it seems reasonable to change the cardiopulmonary resuscitation algorithm (in the context of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19) by reducing the duration of the CPR cycle from the current 2-min to 1-min cycles due to a statistically significant reduction in the quality of chest compressions among rescuers wearing PPE AGP.","output":"Resuscitation of the patient with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 when wearing personal protective equipment: A randomized multicenter crossover simulation trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the rates for consulting a general practitioner (GP) for sequelae after acute covid-19 in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 and those managed in the community, and to determine how the rates change over time for patients in the community and after vaccination for covid-19. DESIGN: Population based study. SETTING: 1392 general practices in England contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum database. PARTICIPANTS: 456 002 patients with a diagnosis of covid-19 between 1 August 2020 and 14 February 2021 (44.7% men; median age 61 years), admitted to hospital within two weeks of diagnosis or managed in the community, and followed-up for a maximum of 9.2 months. A negative control group included individuals without covid-19 (n=38 511) and patients with influenza before the pandemic (n=21 803). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of rates for consulting a GP for new symptoms, diseases, prescriptions, and healthcare use in individuals admitted to hospital and those managed in the community, separately, before and after covid-19 infection, using Cox regression and negative binomial regression for healthcare use. The analysis was repeated for the negative control and influenza cohorts. In individuals in the community, outcomes were also described over time after a diagnosis of covid-19, and compared before and after vaccination for individuals who were symptomatic after covid-19 infection, using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Relative to the negative control and influenza cohorts, patients in the community (n=437 943) had significantly higher GP consultation rates for multiple sequelae, and the most common were loss of smell or taste, or both (adjusted hazard ratio 5.28, 95% confidence interval 3.89 to 7.17, P<0.001); venous thromboembolism (3.35, 2.87 to 3.91, P<0.001); lung fibrosis (2.41, 1.37 to 4.25, P=0.002), and muscle pain (1.89, 1.63 to 2.20, P<0.001); and also for healthcare use after a diagnosis of covid-19 compared with 12 months before infection. For absolute proportions, the most common outcomes 4 weeks after a covid-19 diagnosis in patients in the community were joint pain (2.5%), anxiety (1.2%), and prescriptions for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (1.2%). Patients admitted to hospital (n=18 059) also had significantly higher GP consultation rates for multiple sequelae, most commonly for venous thromboembolism (16.21, 11.28 to 23.31, P<0.001), nausea (4.64, 2.24 to 9.21, P<0.001), prescriptions for paracetamol (3.68, 2.86 to 4.74, P<0.001), renal failure (3.42, 2.67 to 4.38, P<0.001), and healthcare use after a covid-19 diagnosis compared with 12 months before infection. For absolute proportions, the most common outcomes 4 weeks after a covid-19 diagnosis in patients admitted to hospital were venous thromboembolism (3.5%), joint pain (2.7%), and breathlessness (2.8%). In patients in the community, anxiety and depression, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, general pain, nausea, chest tightness, and tinnitus persisted throughout follow-up. GP consultation rates were reduced for all symptoms, prescriptions, and healthcare use, except for neuropathic pain, cognitive impairment, strong opiates, and paracetamol use in patients in the community after the first vaccination dose for covid-19 relative to before vaccination. GP consultation rates were also reduced for ischaemic heart disease, asthma, and gastro-oesophageal disease. CONCLUSIONS: GP consultation rates for sequelae after acute covid-19 infection differed between patients with covid-19 who were admitted to hospital and those managed in the community. For individuals in the community, rates of some sequelae decreased over time but those for others, such as anxiety and depression, persisted. Rates of some outcomes decreased after vaccination in this group.","output":"GP consultation rates for sequelae after acute covid-19 in patients managed in the community or hospital in the UK: population based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with traumatic brain injury may be dependent on the decision-making of their families.

The current most established quantification method for H2S is HPLC method coupled with fluorescence detection after derivatization with a costly fluorescent reagent, Monobromobimane (MBB). However, The MBB method is characterized by strict reaction condition, long reaction time, tedious operation, and inconsistent reported results. In this study, based on the thiolysis reaction of 7-nitro-2, 1, 3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) ether, the commonly used chromatographic modifier 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3- benzoxadiazole (NBDCl) and four probes (NBDOMe, NBDOEt, NBDOTFE and NBDOCMR) synthesized from NBDCl were tested as alternatives for fast quantification of H2S by LC-MS/MS. The reaction product between NBD ethers/NBDCl and H2S showed special pink color visible to the naked eye and was easy to synthesize and separate in lab; it also showed good retention on common chromatographic columns and high instrument response; therefore it is a good determinand. After establishment of LC-MS/MS methods for all the related compounds, the reaction conditions were optimized for all the probes with H2S. Then the stability, selectivity, reaction rate, sensitivity and quantitative linear relationship between the reaction product and H2S concentration were studied for each probe. Finally, NBDOEt was selected for LC-MS/MS detection of H2S. In comparision with the MBB method, the established NBDOEt method showed matched sensitivity and linearity, better selectivity, and higher repeatability; and had the advantages of easy operation, simple reaction condition, and cheap raw materials. The method was successfully validated and applied to determination of Na2S content in Na2Sa??9H2O bulk drug and injection. In conclusion, NBDOEt is a promising option for quantification of H2S in abiotic matrix.","output":"A simple liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method for fast detection of hydrogen sulfide based on thiolysis of 7-nitro-2, 1, 3-benzoxadiazole ether"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of contraceptive method use among women, assess concerns about hormonal contraception (HC) and copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) and determine characteristics associated with concerns of HC and Cu-IUD. METHOD Cross-sectional study. Swedish speaking women (n = 212) aged 16-50 attending midwives at four outpatient clinics in two of Sweden's larger cities answered a waiting room questionnaire. Content analysis was used to categorise open-ended questions with free text answers. RESULTS Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) was used by 30.4%, short acting reversible contraceptives (SARC) by 28.0%, and 16.4% did not use any contraception during most recent intercourse. Four out of ten (41.2%) had concerns about using HC and 52.3% about using Cu-IUD. The most common reason for having concerns regarding HC was unspecified side effects, fear of hormones and adverse mood symptoms; regarding Cu-IUD, concerns related to increased bleeding and menstrual pain. Among those expressing concerns, experience of induced abortion was twice as common. Women who did not have concerns about HC were using combined oral contraception (COC) to a higher extent.

However, there are still many challenges to be solved to develop an effective mucosal vaccine, such as poor adhesion to the mucosal surface, insufficient uptake to break through the mucus, and the difficulty in avoiding strong degradation through the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, increasing efforts to overcome these issues have been made, and we herein summarize the latest findings on these strategies to develop mucosa-targeting vaccines, including a novel needle-free mucosa-targeting route, the development of mucosa-targeting vectors, the administration of mucosal adjuvants, encapsulating vaccines into nanoparticle formulations, and antigen design to conjugate with mucosa-targeting ligands.

Although emerging studies have identified lymphopenia as a driver of cytokine storm, disease progression, and poor outcomes in infected patients, its immunopathogenesis, as well as environmental and genetic determinants, remain unclear. Understanding the interplay of these determinants in the context of lymphopenia and COVID-19 complications in patients in Africa may help with risk stratification and appropriate deployment of targeted treatment regimens with repurposed drugs to improve prognosis. OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to investigate the role of vitamin D status, vasculopathy, apoptotic pathways, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the immunopathogenesis of lymphopenia among African people infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This cross-sectional study will enroll 230 participants, categorized as \\"SARS-CoV-2 negative\\" (n=69), \\"COVID-19 mild\\" (n=32), \\"hospitalized\\" (n=92), and \\"recovered\\" (n=37), from two health facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. Sociodemographic data, travel history, and information on comorbidities will be obtained from case files and through a pretested, interview-based structured questionnaire. Venous blood samples (5 mL) collected between 8 AM and 10 AM and aliquoted into EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and plain tubes will be used for complete blood count and CD4 T cell assays to determine lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1000 cells/L) and CD4 T lymphocyte levels, as well as to measure the concentrations of vitamin D, caspase 3, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) using an autoanalyzer, flow cytometry, and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) techniques. Genomic DNA will be extracted from the buffy coat and used as a template for the amplification of apoptosis-related genes (Bax, Bcl-2, BCL2L12) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyping of VDR (Apa1, Fok1, and Bsm1) gene polymorphisms by the PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism method and capillary sequencing. Total RNA will also be extracted, reverse transcribed, and subsequently quantitated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to monitor the expression of apoptosis genes in the four participant categories. Data analyses, which include a test of association between VDR gene polymorphisms and study outcomes (lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D prevalence, mild/moderate and severe infections) will be performed using the R statistical software. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium analyses for the alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of the genotyped VDR gene will also be carried out. RESULTS: A total of 45 participants comprising 37 SARS-CoV-2-negative and 8 COVID-19-recovered individuals have been enrolled so far. Their complete blood counts and CD4 T lymphocyte counts have been determined, and their serum samples and genomic DNA and RNA samples have been extracted and stored at -20 C until further analyses. Other expected outcomes include the prevalence and distribution of lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D in the control (SARS-CoV-2 negative), confirmed, hospitalized, and recovered SARS-CoV-2-positive participants; association of lymphopenia with CD4 T lymphocyte level, serum vitamin D, sVCAM-1, sFasL, and caspase 3 levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; expression levels of apoptosis-related genes among hospitalized participants with COVID-19, and those with lymphopenia compared to those without lymphopenia; and frequency distribution of the alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of VDR gene polymorphisms in COVID-19-infected participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study will aid in the genotypic and phenotypic stratification of COVID-19-infected patients in Nigeria with and without lymphopenia to enable biomarker discovery and pave the way for the appropriate and timely deployment of patient-centered treatments to improve prognosis.

Time from TUR to first instillation of induction BCG was stratified by quartile and analyzed as a continuous variable. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests analyzed differences in recurrence free- and progression-free survival (RFS, PFS). Cox proportional hazards regression models identified associations between risk factors and survival outcomes. RESULTS 518 patients received adequate BCG at a median 26 days from TUR (range 6-188 days). 45 patients (9%) developed BCG intolerance at a median 12th instillation (range 7-33). When time from TUR to BCG was stratified into quartiles, there was no difference with respect BCG intolerance (P=0.966), RFS (P=0.632) nor PFS (P=0.789).

However, the clinical efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 patients remain unclear. METHODS: To assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab treatment in COVID-19 patients, we performed a retrospective case-control study. The study was conducted, including 95 patients treated with tocilizumab plus standard treatment and matched controls with 95 patients treated with standard treatment therapy by propensity score from February to April 2020. We searched some databases using the search terms for studies published from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2021. RESULTS: Our case-control study found a lower mortality rate in the tocilizumab treatment group than in the standard treatment group (9.47% versus 16.84%, P = 0.134), but the results were not statistically significant. We also found that the mortality rate in tocilizumab treatment groups was significantly lower than in the standard treatment group in the stratified ICU analysis (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44C0.61, P = 0.048 and OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10C0.99, P = 0.044). We selected 49 studies (including 6568 cases and 11,660 controls) that met the inclusion criteria in the meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, we performed a meta-analysis that showed significantly decreased mortality after patients received tocilizumab (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69C0.95, P = 0.008). We also revealed significant associations within some subgroups. The sequential trial analysis showed a true-positive result.

Using serum samples from a prospective cohort of paramedics, we calculated the performance of the V-PLEX nucleocapsid (N) assay to classify prior SARS-CoV-2 infections, defined as a (i) history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test or (ii) positive serology results using the Roche Elecsys total nucleocapsid anti-SARS-Cov-2 assay. We calculated sensitivity and specificity at the optimal threshold (defined by the highest Youden index). We compared subgroups based on vaccination status, and between models that excluded prior infections 3 to 12 months before sample collection. Of 1119 participants, 914 (81.7%) were vaccinated and 60 (5.4%) had evidence of a preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall and within vaccinated and unvaccinated subgroups, the optimal thresholds were 828 AU/mL, 827 AU/mL, and 1324 AU/mL; with sensitivities of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.96), 0.95 (0.94 to 0.96), 0.94 (0.92 to 0.96) and specificities of 0.88 (0.86 to 0.90), 0.87 (0.85 to 0.89), and 0.94 (0.89 to 0.98), respectively. N-assay specificity was significantly better in unvaccinated (versus vaccinated) individuals (P = 0.005). Overall optimal thresholds based on the AUC values were higher for samples from unvaccinated participants, especially when examining infections within the preceding 9 months (5855 versus 1704 AU/mL). Overall, V-PLEX nucleocapsid assay cutoff values were higher among unvaccinated individuals. Specificity was also significantly higher among unvaccinated individuals.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were used from two different prospective cohort studies: 241 outpatients with HF (mean age 78  9 years, 48% female) and 686 geriatric outpatients (mean age 80  7 years, 55% female). We similarly assessed the following geriatric domains in both cohorts: physical function, nutritional status, polypharmacy, cognitive function, and activities in daily living. Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to relate individual domains to 1 year mortality risk in both populations and to compare 1 year mortality risk between both populations. Of the patients with HF, 34% had impairments in 3 domains, compared with 38% in geriatric patients. One\\\\year mortality rates were 13% and 8%, respectively, in the HF and geriatric populations; age\\\\adjusted and sex\\\\adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for patients with HF compared with geriatric patients was 1.7 (1.3C2.6). The individual geriatric domains were similarly associated with 1 year mortality risk in both populations. Compared with zero to two impaired domains, age\\\\adjusted and sex\\\\adjusted mortality risk (hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval) for three, four, or five impaired domains ranged from 1.6 (0.6C4.2) to 6.5 (2.1C20.1) in the HF population and from 1.4 (0.7C2.9) to 7.9 (2.9C21.3) in the geriatric population. CONCLUSIONS: In parallel with geriatric patients, patients with HF often have multiple geriatric domain impairments that adversely affect their prognosis. This similarity together with the findings that patients with HF have a higher 1 year mortality risk than a general geriatric population supports the integration of a multi\\\\domain geriatric assessment in outpatient HF care.","output":"Managing older patients with heart failure calls for a holistic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: This retrospective cohort analysis examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prehospital setting in Germany The data of two emergency physician response units of a northern German region with 1 2 million citizens was analyzed retrospectively Materials and Methods: We analyzed the period March 16 to April 16 for the year 2020 when the lockdown took place in Germany and compare the results for the same period for the year 2019 and 2018 1004 patients were included Demographic data, the type of rescue missions, the number of missions per day, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Score (NACA-score), the frequency of respiratory emergencies (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 associated), as well as the number of deaths were documented Results: Mean age was 62 3+/-24 8 years and 576 (56 5%) were male Number of missions were 397, 403 and 333 in 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively The control room registered a 22% reduction of rescue missions for the year 2020 Even the amount of emergency calls via the emergency number 112 was reduced by 17 4% between 2018 and 2020 150 (14 9%) missions were due to respiratory emergencies In 2020 10 missions (28 6% of respiratory emergencies) were COVID-19 related In 2020 the NACA score increased significantly Conclusion: We found a decreasing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany on the number of emergency calls as well as missions, and an increase of the severity of cases in preclinical care for a northern German region with 1 2 million citizens The effect of these findings caused by COVID-19 on the health care system remains to be seen","output":"A Retrospective Analysis of the Initial Effect of COVID-19 on German Prehospital Care During Lockdown in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, we identified and screened over 490 peer-reviewed publications on pancreatic transplantation, over 500 on intestinal transplantation, and over 5000 on kidney transplantation.

Demographic data, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers, including C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, and the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, as well as patient outcomes, were compared between men and women. During the study period, 701 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were admitted. The patient's mean age was 6117 years. There were 370 men (52.8%). There was no difference in age, racial distribution, and comorbidities in the male patients compared with the female patients. However, both the baseline and peak levels of CRP and ferritin were significantly higher in men as compared with women. While the baseline D-dimer was similar between the sexes, men had a significantly higher maximal D-dimer. Men had evidence of greater disease severity, with a significantly greater admission to the intensive care unit and borderline higher hospital mortality. Our study supports the observation that COVID-19 causes more severe disease in men. The greater disease severity in men was not due to the effect of age or comorbidities; however, in keeping with experimental studies, men had evidence of a heightened inflammatory response, likely contributing to disease severity.","output":"Gender-based disparities in COVID-19 patient outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid dissemination of scientific and medical discoveries. Current platforms available for the distribution of scientific and clinical research data and information include preprint repositories and traditional peer-reviewed journals. In recent times, social media has emerged as a helpful platform to share scientific and medical discoveries. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively analyze activity on social media (specifically, Twitter) and that related to publications in the form of preprint and peer-reviewed journal articles in the context of COVID-19 and gastroenterology during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: COVID-19Crelated data from Twitter (tweets and user data) and articles published in preprint servers (bioRxiv and medRxiv) as well as in the PubMed database were collected and analyzed during the first 6 months of the pandemic, from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organCspecific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity. Any relationship between Twitter activity and preprint articles published and that between Twitter activity and PubMed articles published overall, by organ system, and by geographic location were identified using Spearmans rank-order correlation. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period, 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7164 journal publications, and 4702 preprint publications were retrieved. Twitter activity (ie, number of tweets) peaked in March 2020, whereas preprint and publication activity (ie, number of articles published) peaked in April 2020. Overall, strong correlations were identified between trends in Twitter activity and preprint and publication activity (P<.001 for both). COVID-19 data across the three platforms mainly concentrated on pulmonology or critical care, but when analyzing the field of gastroenterology specifically, most tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal gastroenterology. Furthermore, there were significant positive associations between trends in Twitter and publication activity for all gastroenterology topics (luminal gastroenterology: P=.009; hepatology and inflammatory bowel disease: P=.006; gastrointestinal endoscopy: P=.007), except pancreatology (P=.20), suggesting that Twitter activity did not correlate with publication activity for this topic. Finally, Twitter activity was the highest in the United States (7331 tweets), whereas PubMed activity was the highest in China (1768 publications). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential of social media as a vehicle for disseminating scientific information during a public health crisis. Sharing and spreading information on COVID-19 in a timely manner during the pandemic has been paramount; this was achieved at a much faster pace on social media, particularly on Twitter. Future investigation could demonstrate how social media can be used to augment and promote scholarly activity, especially as the world begins to increasingly rely on digital or virtual platforms. Scientists and clinicians should consider the use of social media in augmenting public awareness regarding their scholarly pursuits.","output":"Social Media and Research Publication Activity During Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Trend Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Older adults have been continuously reported to be at higher risk for adverse outcomes of Covid-19. We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and early outcomes of the older Covid-19 patients hospitalized in our center comparatively with the younger patients, and also to analyze the triage factors that were related to the in-hospital mortality of older adults. DESIGN: Retrospective; observational study. SETTING: Istanbul Faculty of Medicine hospital, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: 362 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from March 11 to May 11, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: The demographic information; associated comorbidities; presenting clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics on admission and outcomes from the electronic medical records were analyzed comparatively between the younger (<65 years) and older (65 years) adults. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality of the older adults were analyzed by multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: The median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46C67), and 224 (61.9%) were male. There were 104 (28.7%) patients 65 years of age. More than half of the patients (58%) had one or more chronic comorbidity. The three most common presenting symptoms in the older patients were fatigue/myalgia (89.4%), dry cough (72.1%), and fever (63.5%). Cough and fever were significantly less prevalent in older adults compared to younger patients (p=0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Clinically severe pneumonia was present in 31.5% of the study population being more common in older adults (49% vs. 24.4%) (p<0.001). The laboratory parameters that were significantly different between the older and younger adults were as follows: the older patients had significantly higher CRP, D-dimer, TnT, pro-BNP, procalcitonin levels, higher prevalence of lymphopenia, neutrophilia, increased creatinine, and lower hemoglobin, ALT, albumin level (p<0.05). In the radiological evaluation, more than half of the patients (54.6%) had moderate-severe pneumonia, which was more prevalent in older patients (66% vs. 50%) (p=0.006). The adverse outcomes were significantly more prevalent in older adults compared to the younger patients (ICU admission, 28.8% vs. 8.9%; mortality, 23.1% vs. 4.3%, p<0.001). Among the triage evaluation parameters, the only factor associated with higher mortality was the presence of clinically severe pneumonia on admission (Odds Ratio=12.3, 95% confidence interval=2.7C55.5, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Older patients presented with more prevalent chronic comorbidities, less prevalent symptomatology but more severe respiratory signs and laboratory abnormalities than the younger patients.

Therefore, the discovery of novel antiviral compounds is needed; in this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) like temporins hold great promise. Here, we discovered that the harmless temporin G (TG) significantly inhibited the early life-cycle phases of influenza virus. The in vitro hemagglutinating test revealed the existence of TG interaction with the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Furthermore, the hemolysis inhibition assay and the molecular docking studies confirmed a TG/HA complex formation at the level of the conserved hydrophobic stem groove of HA. Remarkably, these findings highlight the ability of TG to block the conformational rearrangements of HA2 subunit, which are essential for the viral envelope fusion with intracellular endocytic vesicles, thereby neutralizing the virus entry into the host cell. In comparison, in the case of parainfluenza virus, which penetrates host cells upon a membrane-fusion process, addition of TG to infected cells provoked ~1.2 log reduction of viral titer released in the supernatant. Nevertheless, at the same condition, an immunofluorescent assay showed that the expression of viral hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein was not significantly reduced. This suggested a peptide-mediated block of some late steps of viral replication and therefore the impairment of the extracellular release of viral particles. Overall, our results are the first demonstration of the ability of an AMP to interfere with the replication of respiratory viruses with a different mechanism of cell entry and will open a new avenue for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against a large variety of respiratory viruses, including the recent SARS-CoV2.","output":"Temporin G, an amphibian antimicrobial peptide against influenza and parainfluenza respiratory viruses: Insights into biological activity and mechanism of action."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide.

The stabilization of the vaccine construct is validated with molecular dynamics simulation studies.

STUDY SELECTION We included clinical studies that described sepsis or septic shock and used any clustering method to identify sepsis phenotypes. We excluded conference abstracts, literature reviews, comments, letters to the editor, and in vitro studies. We assessed study quality using a validated risk of bias tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies.

DATA SYNTHESIS Sepsis phenotyping methods most frequently grouped patients based on the degree of inflammatory response and coagulopathy using clinical, nongenomic variables. Five articles clustered patients based on genomic or transcriptomic data. Seven articles generated patient subgroups with differential response to sepsis treatments. Cluster clinical characteristics and their associations with mortality and treatment response were heterogeneous across studies, and validity was evaluated in nine of 17 articles, hindering pooled analysis of results and derivation of universal truths regarding sepsis phenotypes, their prognostic capabilities, and their associations with treatment response.

Face masks are believed to protect people from infection by blocking those droplets. However, current filtration efficiency tests can't evaluate masks under sneeze-like pressure. The goal of this study was to establish a method to evaluate the filtration efficiency of mask materials under extreme conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Efficiency of surgical masks, gauze masks, gauze, cotton, silk, linen and tissue paper on blocking micro-droplet sized starch particles (average 8.2 m) and latex microspheres (0.75 m) with a velocity of 44.4 m/s created by centrifugation was qualitatively analyzed by using imaging-based analysis. RESULTS: The 4 layers of silk could block 93.8% of microspheres and 88.9% of starch particles, followed by the gauze mask (78.5% of microspheres and 90.4% of starch particles) and the 2 layers of cotton (74.6% of microspheres and 87.5-89.0% of particles). Other materials also blocked 53.2-66.5% of microspheres and 76.4%-87.9% of particles except the 8 layers of gauze which only blocked 36.7% of particles. The filtration efficiency was improved by the increased layers of materials. CONCLUSION: Centrifugation-based filtration efficiency test not only compensates shortcomings of current tests for masks, but also offers a simple way to explore new mask materials during pandemics. Common mask materials can potentially provide protection against respiratory droplet transmission.","output":"A New Method for Testing Filtration Efficiency of Mask Materials Under Sneeze-like Pressure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus infections are spreading rapidly worldwide, and primary and middle schools are closed in many countries. After the state of emergency was lifted in Japan, schools have reopened, and teachers are conducting face-to-face classes while maintaining safety precautions. This study aimed to assess the factors contributing to infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety among teachers conducting face-to-face classes during the COVID-19 pandemic after schools reopened. METHODS: This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 263 primary and middle school teachers in the Shinagawa area of Tokyo (October 10-30, 2020). The questionnaire assessed the type of school (primary or middle school), sex, age, and factors contributing to infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that arose from the pandemic. The levels of anxiety and the factors contributing to anxiety were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very anxious). RESULTS: In an analysis of the data of 237 participants excluding the missing data, many teachers reported feeling infection- and education-related anxiety. A majority of the participants were women (n = 152, 64.1%), and the mean age of the participants was 39.8  11.3 years. A stepwise multiple regression analysis identified six factors for infection-related anxiety as significant (R2 = 0.61, p < 0.001). Among these variables, the largest partial regression coefficient value was reported for the following reason: \\"I feel anxious because we cannot ensure the safety of teachers themselves or of their families\\" (? = 0.37, p < 0.001). For educational anxiety, four of six reasons were identified as significant (R2 = 0.64, p < 0.001). Among these, \\"anxiety about the students' home situations\\" (? = 0.41, p < 0.001) and \\"delay in education (students' side)\\" (? = 0.27, p < 0.001) had stronger associations with anxiety compared to the others. CONCLUSION: In-person education during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused teachers to experience anxiety. This report provides useful information by highlighting the reasons for infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that teachers experience in face-to-face classes during a pandemic. Even if the coverage of a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widespread worldwide, we will still be combating COVID-19 infections for at least a few years. Given concerns regarding such infections, to ensure students' right to education, it is essential to understand why teachers feel anxious and to determine appropriate measures to decrease such anxiety.","output":"Causes of anxiety among teachers giving face-to-face lessons after the reopening of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering that female sexual hormones may modulate the inflammatory response and also exhibit direct effects on the cells of the immune system, herein, we intend to discuss the sex differences and the role of estradiol in modulating the lung and systemic inflammatory response, focusing on its possible application as a treatment modality for SARS-CoV-2 patients. COVID-19 patients develop severe hypoxemia early in the course of the disease, which is silent most of the time. Small fibrinous thrombi in pulmonary arterioles and a tumefaction of endothelial were observed in the autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases. Studies showed that the viral infection induces a vascular process in the lung, which included vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Further, the proportions of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes were strongly reduced in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estradiol is connected with CD4+ T cell numbers and increases T-reg cell populations, affecting immune responses to infection. It is known that estradiol exerts a protective effect on endothelial function, activating the generation of nitric oxide (NO) via endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Estrogen attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to various stimuli and induces vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature during stress situations like hypoxia. It exerts a variety of rapid actions, which are initiated after its coupling with membrane receptors, which in turn, may positively modulate vascular responses in pulmonary disease and help to maintain microvascular flow. Direct and indirect mechanisms underlying the effects of estradiol were investigated, and the results point to a possible protective effect of estradiol against COVID-19, indicating that it may be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic element for the treatment of patients affected by the novel coronavirus.","output":"17-Estradiol, a potential ally to alleviate SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical examination allows the neurologist to test hypotheses generated by their interpretation of the patient's story.

In silico analyses revealed the presence of intrinsically disordered stretches and putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization signals in the PGRS domain of Rv0297 (Rv0297PGRS). The PGRS domain aids in ER localization, which was shown by infecting macrophage cells with M. tuberculosis and by overexpressing the protein by transfection in macrophage cells followed by activation of the unfolded protein response, as evident from increased expression of GRP78/GRP94 and CHOP/ATF4, leading to disruption of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and increased nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The consequent activation of the effector caspase-8 resulted in apoptosis of macrophages, which was Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent.

These results implicate a hitherto-unknown role of the PGRS domain of the PE_PGRS protein family in ER stress-mediated cell death through TLR4.

Here, we developed and validated a targeted enrichment platform and conducted large-scale transcriptome analyses of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. We used both an experimental hematopoietic cell model of latency and cells from naturally infected, healthy human subjects (clinical) to define the breadth of viral genes expressed. The viral transcriptome derived from experimental infection was highly correlated with that from clinical infection, validating our experimental latency model. These transcriptomes revealed a broader profile of gene expression during infection in hematopoietic cells than previously appreciated. Further, using recombinant viruses that establish a nonreactivating, latent-like or a replicative infection in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, we defined classes of low to moderately expressed genes that are differentially regulated in latent vs. replicative states of infection. Most of these genes have yet to be studied in depth. By contrast, genes that were highly expressed, were expressed similarly in both latent and replicative infection. From these findings, a model emerges whereby low or moderately expressed genes may have the greatest impact on regulating the switch between viral latency and replication.

The dynamic movement of the hyoid, visible in ultrasound, is crucial in facilitating bolus transition and protection of the airway during a swallow and has shown promise as a biomarker of swallowing function. AIMS: To examine the kinematics of the hyoid during a swallow using ultrasound imaging and to relate the patterns to the different stages of a normal swallow. To evaluate the accuracy and robustness of two different automatic hyoid tracking methods relative to manual hyoid position estimation. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Ultrasound data recorded from 15 healthy participants swallowing a 10 ml water bolus delivered by cup or spoon were analysed. The movement of the hyoid was tracked using manually marked frame-to-frame positions, automated hyoid shadow tracking and deep neural net (DNN) tracking. Hyoid displacement along the horizontal image axis (HxD) was charted throughout a swallow, and the maximum horizontal displacement (HxD max) and maximum hyoid velocity (HxV max) along the same axis were automatically calculated. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The HxD and HxV of 10 ml swallows are similar to values reported in the literature. The trajectory of the hyoid movement and its location at significant swallow event time points showed increased hyoid displacement towards the peak of the swallow. Using an interclass correlation coefficient, HxD max and HxV max values derived from the DNN tracker and shadow tracker are shown to be in high agreement and moderate agreement, respectively, when compared with values derived from manual tracking. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The similarity of the hyoid tracking results using ultrasound to previous reports based on different instrumental tools supports the possibility of using hyoid movement as a measure of swallowing function in ultrasound. The use of machine learning to automatically track the hyoid movement potentially provides a reliable and efficient way to quantify swallowing function. These findings contribute towards improving the clinical utility of ultrasound as a swallowing assessment tool. Further research on both normative and clinical populations is needed to validate hyoid movement metrics as a means of differentiating normal and abnormal swallows and to verify the reliability of automatic tracking. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject There is growing interest in the use of ultrasound as an adjunct tool for assessing swallowing function. However, there is currently insufficient knowledge about the patterning and timing of lingual and hyoid movement in a typical swallow. We know that movement of the hyoid plays an essential role in bolus transition and airway protection. However, manual tracking of hyoid movement is time-consuming and restricts the extent of large-scale normative studies. What this study adds We show that hyoid movement can be tracked automatically, providing measurable continuous positional data. Measurements derived from this objective data are comparable with similar measures previously reported using videofluoroscopy and of the two automatic trackers assessed, the DNN approach demonstrates better robustness and higher agreement with manually derived measures. Using this kinematic data, hyoid movement can be related to different stages of swallowing. Clinical implications of this study This study contributes towards our understanding of the kinematics of a typical swallow by evaluating an automated hyoid tracking method, paving the way for future studies of typical and disordered swallow. The challenges of image acquisition highlight issues to be considered when establishing clinical protocols. The application of machine learning enhances the utility of ultrasound swallowing assessment by reducing the labour required and permitting a wider range of hyoid measurements. Further research in normative and clinical populations is facilitated by automatic data extraction allowing the validity of prospective hyoid measures in differentiating different types of swallows to be rigorously assessed.","output":"Automated assessment of hyoid movement during normal swallow using ultrasound"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existence of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in wastewater raises the opportunity of tracking wastewater for epidemiological monitoring of this disease However, the existence of this virus in wastewater has raised health concerns regarding the fecalCoral transmission of COVID-19 This short review is intended to highlight the potential implications of aerosolized wastewater in transmitting this virus As aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 could offer a more direct respiratory pathway for human exposure, the transmission of this virus remains a significant possibility in the prominent wastewater-associated bioaerosols formed during toilet flushing, wastewater treatment, and sprinkler irrigation Implementing wastewater disinfection, exercising precautions, and raising public awareness would be essential Additional research is needed to evaluate the survival, fate, and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the environment and rapid characterization of aerosols and their risk assessment","output":"Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Aerosolized Wastewater: Toilet Flushing, Wastewater Treatment, and Sprinkler Irrigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this volume of the Side Effects of Drugs Annual, although other vaccines will be covered, the safety of COVID vaccines is the focus as COVID-19 has led to heightened attention on vaccine safety in general.

To counter these outcomes, many countries, including France, put in place strict lockdown measures, requiring the temporary closure of all but essential places and causing an unprecedented disruption of daily life. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to explore potential changes in dietary intake, physical activity, body weight, and food supply during the COVID-19 lockdown and how these differed according to individual characteristics. METHODS: The analyses included 37,252 adults from the French web-based NutriNet-Sant cohort who completed lockdown-specific questionnaires in AprilCMay 2020. Nutrition-related changes and their sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-status correlates were investigated using multivariable logistic regression models. Clusters of participants were defined using an ascending hierarchical classification of change profiles derived from multiple correspondence analyses. RESULTS: During the lockdown, trends of unfavorable changes were observed: decreased physical activity (reported by 53% of the participants), increased sedentary time (reported by 63%), increased snacking, decreased consumption of fresh food (especially fruit and fish), and increased consumption of sweets, cookies, and cakes. Yet, the opposite trends were also observed: increased home cooking (reported by 40%) and increased physical activity (reported by 19%). Additionally, 35% of the participants gained weight (mean weight gain in these individuals, 1.8 kg  SD 1.3 kg) and 23% lost weight (2 kg  SD 1.4 kg weight loss). All of these trends displayed associations with various individual characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that nutrition-related changes occurred during the lockdown in both unfavorable and favorable directions. The observed unfavorable changes should be considered in the event of a future lockdown, and should also be monitored to prevent an increase in the nutrition-related burden of disease, should these diet/physical activity changes be maintained in the long run.

Notably, serine-/arginine- (SR)-rich RBPs are densely phosphorylated compared with the remainder of the proteome. Previously, we showed that dephosphorylation of the splicing factor SRSF2 regulated increased interactions with similar arginine-rich RBPs U1-70K and LUC7L3. However, the large-scale functional and structural impact of these modifications on RBPs remains unclear. In this work, we dephosphorylated nuclear extracts using phosphatase in vitro and analyzed equal amounts of detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions by mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. Correlation network analysis resolved 27 distinct modules of differentially soluble nucleoplasm proteins. We found classes of arginine-rich RBPs that decrease in solubility following dephosphorylation and enrich the insoluble pelleted fraction, including the SR protein family and the SR-like LUC7L RBP family. Importantly, increased insolubility was not observed across broad classes of RBPs. We determined that phosphorylation regulated SRSF2 structure, as dephosphorylated SRSF2 formed high-molecular-weight oligomeric species in vitro. Reciprocally, phosphorylation of SRSF2 by serine/arginine protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) in vitro decreased high-molecular-weight SRSF2 species formation. Furthermore, upon pharmacological inhibition of SRPKs in mammalian cells, we observed SRSF2 cytoplasmic mislocalization and increased formation of cytoplasmic granules as well as cytoplasmic tubular structures that associated with microtubules by immunocytochemical staining. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that phosphorylation may be a critical modification that prevents arginine-rich RBP insolubility and oligomerization.","output":"Phosphorylation regulates arginine-rich RNA-binding protein solubility and oligomerization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been lots of published work examining the association between COVID-19 and mental health, particularly, anxiety and depression in the general populations and disease subpopulations globally. Depression is a debilitating disorder affecting individuals' level of bio-psychological-social functioning across different age groups. Since almost all studies were cross-sectional studies, there seems to be a lack of robust, large-scale, and technological-based interventional studies to restore the general public's optimal psychosocial wellbeing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is a relatively new non-intrusive brain stimulation (NIBS) technology, and only a paucity of studies was conducted related to the TPS treatment on older adults with mild neurocognitive disorders. However, there is by far no study conducted on young adults with major depressive disorder nationwide. This gives us the impetus to execute the first nationwide study evaluating the efficacy of TPS on the treatment of depression among young adults in Hong Kong. METHODS: This study proposes a two-armed single-blinded randomised controlled trial including TPS as an intervention group and a waitlist control group. Both groups will be measured at baseline (T1), immediately after the intervention (T2), and at the 3- month follow-up (T3). RECRUITMENT: A total of 30 community-dwelling subjects who are aged 18 and above and diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) will be recruited in this study. All subjects will be computer randomised into either the intervention group or the waitlist control group, balanced by gender and age on a 1:1 ratio. INTERVENTION: All subjects in each group will have to undertake functional MRI (fMRI) before and after six 30-min TPS sessions, which will be completed in 2 weeks' time. OUTCOMES: Baseline measurements and post-TPS evaluation of the psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, cognition, anhedonia, and instrumental activities of daily living) will also be conducted on all participants. A 3-month follow-up period will be used to assess the long-term sustainability of the TPS intervention. For statistical analysis, ANOVA with repeated measures will be used to analyse data. Missing data were managed by multiple mutations. The level of significance will be set to p < 0.05. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Results of this study will be used to inform health policy to determine whether TPS could be considered as a top treatment option for MDD.

One approach has been the distance learning problem-based learning (PBL) tutorial utilising the online peer-to-peer platform. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of students using distance learning PBL tutorials using with that of students utilising the conventional face-to-face approach. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in a single academic institution. We compared two groups of fourth-year medical students from the same class: one group used distance learning (DL); the other, the face-to-face (FF) method. We used students baseline performance at the preceding block for one-to-one propensity score matching. Students utilising the PBL tutorial were given grades by their tutors according to a standardised scoring system encompassing five key areas (score range: 0C10). The main outcome was a students total score (i.e., the sum of the scores from the five key areas, ranging from 0 to 50). RESULT: We matched 62 students in each group. With four tutorials, there were 490 observations, with 245 in each group. The mean total score for the DL group was 37.5  4.6, which was significantly lower than that of the FF group (39.0  4.4, p < 0.001). We noted that students in the DL group had a significantly lower scores for all five areas of proficiency: participation, communication, preparation, critical thinking and group skills. CONCLUSION: Findings of this study revealed that the performance of students utilising the DL PBL tutorials was lower than that of students participating in the conventional FF approach.

We evaluated the clinical status of COVID-19 survivors at three months after hospital discharge. METHODS In this prospective observational cohort study, hospitalized patients aged 18 years, evaluated at one (M1) and three (M3) months post-discharge were enrolled. 251 patients (71.3% males, median [IQR] age 61.8 [53.5-70.7] years) were included. Median (IQR) time from discharge to M3 was 89 (79.5-101) days. Primary outcome was residual respiratory dysfunction (RRD), defined by tachypnea, moderate to very severe dyspnea, or peripheral oxygen saturation 95% on room air at M3. RESULTS RRD was found in 30.4% of patients, with no significant difference compared with M1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and length of stay were independent predictors of RRD at multivariable logistic regression (odds ratio, OR, [95% confidence interval, CI] 4.13 [1.17-16.88], p 0.033; OR [95% CI] 1.02 [1.00-1.04], p 0.047, respectively). Obesity and C-reactive protein levels upon admission were additional predictors at regression tree analysis. Impaired quality of life (QoL) was reported by 53.2% of patients. Anxiety and insomnia were each present in 25.5% of patients, and PTSD in 22.4%. No difference was found between M1 and M3 in QoL, anxiety or PTSD. Insomnia decreased at M3. Current major psychiatric disorder as well as anxiety, insomnia and PSTD at M1 independently predicted PTSD at M3.

Aim The aim of this study was to determine the visual acuity and outcome in patients who underwent MSICS in a tertiary hospital in south India. Methodology A prospective longitudinal interventional study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Karnataka, India, over a period of nine months. A total of 105 eyes underwent MSICS and were followed up for one month to assess their postoperative visual outcome and complications, if any. During this period, they were started on antibiotic + steroid combination eyedrops, which were tapered over four weeks. Results Results were assessed based on visual grading categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO). A total of 103 (98.1%) patients had good vision, i.e., visual acuity of 6/6 - 6/18, followed by two (1.9%) who had moderate vision i.e., visual acuity of <6/18 - 3/60, and none were blind or with visual acuity of <3/60.

The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were stably transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (19-S), or human ACE2 vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the 19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via 19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. This distinction between the 19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays. Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully.","output":"Deletion of ER-retention Motif on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Reduces Cell Hybrid During Cell-cell Fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Is more novel research always desirable?

Models previously developed to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been rapidly deployed to study SARS-CoV-2. However, it has become clear that despite the common use of ACE2 as a receptor for both viruses, the host range of the 2 viruses does not entirely overlap. Distinct ACE2-interacting residues within the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as species differences in additional proteases needed for activation and internalization of the virus, are likely sources of host differences between the 2 viruses. Spontaneous models include rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, African Green monkeys, hamsters, and ferrets. Viral shedding and transmission studies are more frequently reported in spontaneous models. Mice can be infected with SARS-CoV; however, mouse and rat ACE2 does not support SARS-CoV-2 infection. Murine models for COVID-19 are induced through genetic adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, creation of chimeric SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, use of human ACE2 knock-in and transgenic mice, and viral transfection of wild-type mice with human ACE2. Core aspects of COVID-19 are faithfully reproduced across species and model. These include the acute nature and predominantly respiratory source of viral shedding, acute transient and nonfatal disease with a largely pulmonary phenotype, similar short-term immune responses, and age-enhanced disease.

According to the International Labour Organisation, more than 80% of India's employed nonagricultural population is in the informal sector, implying that they are possibly excluded from receiving health insurance benefits. This is where CBHI comes into play, wherein groups of people belonging to a community define the demand and benefits and pool their resources to provide financial protection to all their members. This study aims to scrutinize the package prices sanctioned by these schemes and compare them with the cost incurred by the hospital. The expense pattern of three surgeries in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology was analysed under three insurance schemes: Arogya Bhagya Yojana, Arogya Karnataka, and Employees' State Insurance Scheme. Methodology. A retrospective study was conducted in a 2,032-bedded tertiary care hospital in South India. Patients of abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy, and caesarean section surgeries covered by any of the insurance schemes mentioned above were a part of the inclusion criteria. The patient records were examined from the hospital's Medical Records Department (MRD). The patients' bills were assembled from the inpatient billing department to scrutinize all the expenses associated with each surgery. The variable costs include consumables, medicine, electricity and AC, diagnostics, blood bank materials, doctor's fee, package differences, and others. In contrast, fixed costs include bed cost, equipment cost (purchase + annual maintenance cost), manpower cost-OT, manpower cost-nursing, and allocated indirect costs associated with the medical treatment. These were computed and compared with the package price of respective insurance schemes to determine if the schemes are profit-yielding schemes or loss-yielding schemes, using the data from the finance department. Results and Conclusion. It has been observed that the operating loss of the hospital for abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy, and caesarean section under CBHI schemes ranges between 7% and 36%. The highest loss was observed in Arogya Karnataka Scheme for caesarean section surgery (BPL patients). The amount received through these schemes is insufficient to cover the costs acquired by the hospital, let alone make a profit. However, under Arogya Bhagya and ESI Schemes, the hospital has made a profit in covering the variable costs for these surgeries. The study concludes that the hospital is running under loss due to the three Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) schemes.","output":"An Assessment of the Economic Feasibility of Selected Surgeries in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department under Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) in a Tertiary Care Hospital in South India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-typhoidal Salmonella is one of the most common causes of bacterial foodborne disease and consumption of contaminated poultry products, including turkey, is one source of exposure. Minimizing Salmonella colonization of commercial turkeys could decrease the incidence of Salmonella-associated human foodborne illness.

In this study, we evaluated bacterial load and blood leukocyte transcriptomic responses of 3-week-old turkeys challenged with the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) UK1 strain. Turkeys (n = 8/dose) were inoculated by oral gavage with 108 or 1010 colony forming units (CFU) of S. Typhimurium UK1, and fecal shedding and tissue colonization were measured across multiple days post-inoculation (dpi). Fecal shedding was 1-2 log10 higher in the 1010 CFU group than the 108 CFU group, but both doses effectively colonized the crop, spleen, ileum, cecum, colon, bursa of Fabricius and cloaca without causing any detectable clinical signs in either group of birds. Blood leukocytes were isolated from a subset of the birds (n = 3-4/dpi) both pre-inoculation (0 dpi) and 2 dpi with 1010 CFU and their transcriptomic responses assayed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).

IL1? was predicted as a major regulator of DE in the leukocytes, which was predicted to activate cell migration, phagocytosis and proliferation, and to impact the STAT3 and toll-like receptor pathways. These analyses revealed genes and pathways by which turkey blood leukocytes responded to the pathogen and can provide potential targets for developing intervention strategies or diagnostic assays to mitigate S.

METHODS: Following Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, we searched five electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science) and an online search engine (Google Scholar). Inclusion criteria consisted of English-language articles focusing on the COVID-19 experiences of people with dementia and their care partners. SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one articles met our inclusion criteria: six letters to the editor, seven commentaries, and eight original research studies. In the literature, five main themes were identified: (i) care partner fatigue and burnout; (ii) lack of access to services and supports; (iii) worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive function; (iv) coping with COVID-19; and (v) the need for more evidence-informed research.

Although immune system malfunction has the most obvious effect, the functions of several tissue cell types are disturbed if Zn supply is limiting. Adhesion molecules and tight junction proteins decrease, while cell death increases, generating barrier dysfunction and possibly organ failure. Taken together, Zn deficiency both weakens the resistance of the human body towards pathogens and at the same time increases the danger of an overactive immune response that may cause tissue damage. The case numbers of Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) are still increasing, which is causing enormous problems for health systems and economies. There is an urgent need to reduce both the number of severe cases and the resulting deaths. While therapeutic options are still under investigation, and first vaccines have been approved, cost-effective ways to reduce the likelihood of or even prevent infection, and the transition from mild symptoms to more serious detrimental disease, are highly desirable. Nutritional supplementation might be an effective option to achieve these aims. In this review, we discuss known Zn deficiency effects in the context of an infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 and its currently known pathogenic mechanisms and elaborate on how severe pre-existing Zn deficiency may pre-dispose patients to a severe progression of COVID-19. First published clinical data on the association of Zn homoeostasis with COVID-19 and registered studies in progress are listed.","output":"Zinc deficiency as a possible risk factor for increased susceptibility and severe progression of Corona Virus Disease 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The segmentation of instances is a key topic in image processing and computer vision.

Nursing informatics has been described as an essential competence for nurse professionals in several countries. In Peru, nursing personnel is predominantly female and represents the largest workforce group in the healthcare system. This article discusses the challenges for capacity-building training programs in nursing informatics in Peru. In general, the published literature on nursing informatics training programs in Peru is rather scarce. Only one out of four Peruvian universities offer courses related to health informatics in undergraduate nursing academic programs. In 2020, the Peruvian Ministry of Health defined the core nursing competences to manage information and communication technologies, and health information systems, including telemedicine. However, nursing informatics has not yet been sufficiently developed in Peru due to organizational, material, cultural and sociotechnical challenges. Moreover, pandemics such as COVID-19 require urgent action to transform health care delivery, to expand telenursing and distance learning nursing programs and initiatives in Peru. Therefore, it is essential to promote research and capacity-building programs in nursing informatics in Peru and foster global collaborative networks between public and private institutions. ? 2021, Universidad de Concepcion.

METHODS The current available randomized controlled trials of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine on SARS were identified through systematically searching literature in any languages or any types of publications. Additional studies of gray literature were also collected. The quality of studies was evaluated by two investigators independently based largely on the quality criteria specified CONSORT. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using RevMan 4.2.0 software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS Six studies (n = 366) fulfilling the inclusion criteria were found, of which the quality of one study was graded as B, the remaining five were graded as C. Two studies were performed with meta-analysis, the other four studies existed some heterogeneity for which meta-analysis could not be performed, a significant effect on lung infiltrate absorption was found in the treatment groups of these two studies (RR 6.68, 95% CI (2.93, 15.24), P<0.01), there was no significant differences between the mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI (0.22, 3.29), P = 0.82) and the average dosage of corticosteroid (WMD -39.65, 95% CI (-116.84, 37.54), P = 0.31). The other three studies also showed significant differences in infiltrate absorption, including national drug No. 2. 3. 4 in combination with Western medicine (RR 5.45, 95% CI (1.54, 19.26)), compound formulas NO. 1 combined with Western medicine (WMD 0.24, 95% CI (0.02, 0.46)), compound formulas combined with Western medicine (RR 8.06, 95% CI (0.40, 163.21)).

This increasingly popularity of Zoom has led to growing debates about its negative health impacts. In particular, Zoom fatigue is a rapidly popularizing phenomena that describes the mental exhaustion or burnout arising from Zoom use. However, the specific mechanisms through which Zoom leads to Zoom fatigue are not well understood. To fill this gap, this study tested a mediated model linking Zoom use with the camera on (ZUC) to Zoom fatigue, through the mediator of social interaction anxiety on Zoom, with a survey sample from the United Kingdom. It was also posited that self-monitoring positively moderated the effects of ZUC on social interaction anxiety on Zoom. The results demonstrated that the direct effects of ZUC on Zoom fatigue was significant and positive. The paper also showed that social interaction anxiety on Zoom increased Zoom fatigue. However, ZUC failed to indirectly increase Zoom fatigue due to the insignificant effects of ZUC on social interaction anxiety on Zoom. Self-monitoring also did not moderate the insignificant relationship between ZUC and social interaction anxiety on Zoom. These insights can guide conceptual frameworks for future research exploring the social psychological impacts of digital media on health.

Motivated by this, we present the first comprehensive study of a two-stage robust telemedicine assignment problem when three different sources of uncertainty are incorporated, including uncertain service duration, no-show behaviours of both patients and telemedical doctors. From an algorithmic viewpoint, we propose an efficient nested column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) solution scheme that decomposes the model into an outer level problem and an inner level problem. Our results show that we can solve the problems of realistic sizes within a reasonable time (e.g., up to 100 patients, 10 telemedical doctors, and 200 scenarios within two hours). On the empirical side, we demonstrate how the hyper-parameters make a balance between cost management and the coverage level of the served patients in the presence of three different sources of uncertainty. Our comparison with a two-stage stochastic programming model implies that our model is not overly conservative and seems to provide a relatively cheaper modeling alternative that requires much less information support when hedging against three different sources of uncertainty under a worst-case situation.","output":"Two-stage robust telemedicine assignment problem with uncertain service duration and no-show behaviours"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv) is an economically significant swine pathogen causing production losses in the global swine industry. Clinical impact depends on many factors including the virus itself. One method to sub-type PRRSv is using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The RFLP pattern 1-7-4 emerged within the United States swine industry in 2014 and has become prevalent since then. This was a field study that prospectively followed 1-7-4-infected breeding herds (n=107) and compared time to stability (TTS), time to baseline production (TTBP) and total loss per 1000 sows between herds using modified-live virus vaccine (MLV) on sows and gilts (MLV-MLV), MLV on sows and MLV in addition to field virus exposure on gilts (MLV-MLV/FVE) or not deliberately exposing sows or gilts to PRRSv (Natural-Natural). Analyses were done in SAS 9.4 and results were adjusted by selected co-variates (duration of herd closure, number of previous PRRSv outbreaks of last 3 years, weaning frequency/week, gilt development unit location, herd size and production system). Survival analysis was conducted on TTS and TTBP and regression analysis on total loss. Herds in the Natural-Natural group achieved TTS and TTBP before other herds. Herds in the MLV-MLV/FVE had the longest TTS and TTBP.

METHODS: We analysed state's COVID-19 data from MarchCMay 2020 to describe time, place and person distribution. We analysed the laboratory surveillance and contact tracing reports to calculate frequency of testing, sample positivity rate (PR) and contacts traced per case. FINDINGS: A total of 2256 cases were reported from MarchCMay, 2020 (attack rate 75 cases/million and case fatality rate 2%). Attack rate was higher among males (81 cases/million males) and maximum affected age group was 60C69 years (164?5 cases/million). Five of 22 districts reported almost half cases in May's first week. Mortality rate was highest among individuals >60years (six deaths/million) and males (two deaths/million males). Of 45 deaths, 41 reported comorbidities [(hypertension (42%), diabetes (40%)].

Objective of the study: to summarize current knowledge about the potential involvement of CVS in the development and progression of acute COVID-19 infection and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and to form an sense of the predictive value, diagnostic tactics and treatment of cardiac anomalies during the coronavirus pandemic. A search was performed in MEDLINE, PubMed, e-library using the search terms ?cardiovascular disease in COVID-19/MIS in children?, ?congenital heart disease/pulmonary hypertension/prolonged QT interval and COVID-19 in children? to identify articles published from April 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021. A literature review indicates that cardiac disorders associated with the new coronavirus infection in children, in the vast majority of cases, developed during MIS, which manifests itself in the form of febrile fever, external signs of Kawasaki disease, hyperinflammatory state and multi-organ damage with an emphasis on CVS. Cardiovascular symptoms occur in the vast majority of children with MIS, and in more than half of the patients C by the type of myocardial dysfunction and/or shock, somewhat less often C in the form of ECG changes, pericardial effusion, oronary artery ectasia. Against the background of treatment with steroids, intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIG) and biologic drugs in combination with inotropic support in almost all children, the morphofunctional characteristics of CVS are restored to normal or subnormal levels in a few days. The need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and lethal cases are rare. The possibility of developing myocarditis (including fatal), pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias associated with COVID-19 in pediatric patients with discussion of possible pathophysiological mechanisms was also described. Long-term observation of this category of persons is necessary due to the uncertain prognosis and the risk of progression of cardiac manifestations. An early comprehensive diagnosis of cardiac disorders and monitoring of the identified changes in children with MIS and acute coronavirus infection are needed.

The lack of knowledge on this virus has led to the implementation of uncertain strategies and measures to fight the pandemic. Here, we review environmental factors that control viral transmission, such as air, temperature, humidity, food, water and sewage, insects, inanimate surfaces, hand hygiene, and social distancing. The main route of viral transmission is the respiratory tract through aerosols. Masks and social distancing are effective in ceasing air transmission. Proper cleaning of surfaces and hand disinfection are required, especially in healthcare units. Food should be handled properly, and food handlers should work based on hygienic protocols.

The state of emergency arising from the Covid-19 pandemic has introduced a new element, given the general concern and feelings of alarm which are global. The most suitable forensic method to analyse these cases is the psychological autopsy. This study's purpose is to analyse the application of the psychological autopsy method to evaluate the impact of the pandemic where government lockdowns impose restrictions on personal freedom. We set out to consider how far this together with other factors may induce suicide.

A research question we address in this work is: do existent well-known clustering algorithms such as k-means or hierarchical clustering methods yield meaningful clusters on the Mol2Vec embeddings? Further, we investigate how far subspace clustering can be utilized to compress the data by reducing the dimensionality of the compounds vector representation. Our first conducted experiments on a set of COVID-19 drug candidates reveal that well-established methods yield meaningful clusters.

Anatomical studies have shown that PVT projects to both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC). However, dual mPFC-HC projecting neurons which could serve a role in synchronizing mPFC and HC activity during PVT-dependent behaviors, have not been explored. Here we used a dual retrograde adenoassociated virus (AAV) tracing approach to characterize the location and proportion of different projection populations that send collaterals to mPFC and/or ventral hippocampus (vHC) in rats. Additionally, we examined the distribution of calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) with respect to these projection populations in PVT. We found that PVT contains separate populations of cells that project to mPFC, vHC, and those that innervate both regions. Interestingly, dual mPFC-HC projecting cells expressed neither CR nor CB. Topographically, CB+ and CR+ containing cells clustered around dual projecting neurons in PVT. These results are consistent with the features of dual mPFC-vHC projecting cells in the nucleus reuniens (RE) and suggestive of a functional mPFC-PVT-vHC system that may support mPFC-vHC interactions in PVT-dependent behaviors.","output":"Dual medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus projecting neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The home environment is thought to influence childrens weight trajectories. However, few studies utilise composite measures of the home environment to examine associations with energy balance behaviours and weight. The present study aimed to adapt and update a comprehensive measure of the obesogenic home environment previously developed for pre-schoolers, and explore associations with school-aged childrens energy balance behaviours and weight. METHODS: Families from the Gemini cohort (n = 149) completed the Home Environment Interview (HEI) via telephone when their children were 12 years old. The HEI comprises four composite scores: one for each domain (food, activity and media) of the environment, as well as a score for the overall obesogenic home environment. The primary caregiver also reported each childs height and weight (using standard scales and height charts), diet, physical activity and sedentary screen-based behaviours. A test-retest sample (n = 20) of caregivers completed the HEI a second time, 7C14 days after the initial interview, to establish test-retest reliability. RESULTS: Children (n = 298) living in higher-risk home environments (a 1 unit increase in the HEI obesogenic risk score) were less likely to consume fruits (OR; 95% CI = 0.40; 0.26C0.61, p < 0.001), and vegetables (0.30; 0.18C0.52, p < 0.001), and more likely to consume energy-dense snack foods (1.71; 1.08C2.69, p = 0.022), convenience foods (2.58; 1.64C4.05, p < 0.001), and fast foods (3.09; 1.90C5.04, p < 0.001). Children living in more obesogenic home environments also engaged in more screen-time ( (SE) = 4.55 (0.78), p < 0.001), spent more time playing video games ( (SE) = 1.56 (0.43), p < 0.001), and were less physically active (OR; 95% CI = 0.57; 0.40C0.80, p < 0.01). Additionally, there was a positive association between higher-risk overall home environment composite score and higher BMI-SDS ( (SE) = 0.23 (0.09), p < 0.01). This finding was mirrored for the home media composite ( (SE) = 0.12 (0.03), p < 0.001). The individual home food and activity composite scores were not associated with BMI-SDS. CONCLUSION: Findings reveal associations between the overall obesogenic home environment and dietary intake, activity levels and screen-based sedentary behaviours, as well as BMI in 12 year olds. These findings suggest that the home environment, and in particular the home media environment, may be an important target for obesity prevention strategies.

Attempts to contain its spread have entailed varying early screening and triage strategies implemented in different countries and regions. AIM: To share the experience of scientific and standardized management of fever clinics in China, which provide the first effective checkpoint for the prevention and control of COVID\\\\19. INTRODUCTION: A fever clinic was established at our hospital in Tianjin, China, for initially identifying suspected cases of COVID\\\\19 and controlling the spread of the disease. METHODS: The management system covered the following aspects: spatial layout; partitioning of functional zones; a work management system and associated processes; management of personnel, materials and equipment; and patient education. RESULTS: Within two months of introducing these measures, there was a comprehensive reduction in the number of new COVID\\\\19 cases in Tianjin, and zero infections occurred among medical staff at the fever clinic. DISCUSSION: The fever clinic plays an important role in the early detection, isolation and referral of patients presenting with fevers of unknown origin. Broad screening criteria, an adequate warning mechanism, manpower reserves and staff training at the clinic are essential for the early management of epidemics. CONCLUSION: The spread of COVID\\\\19 has been effectively curbed through the establishment of the fever clinic, which merits widespread promotion and application. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICIES: Health managers should be made aware of the important role of fever clinics in the early detection, isolation and referral of patients, and in the treatment of infectious diseases to prevent and control their spread. In the early stage of an epidemic, fever clinics should be established in key areas with concentrated clusters of cases.

With the laparoscopic technology developing rapidly in recent years and people's minimally invasive concept improving continuously, laparoscopic radical surgery has been widely used in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Laparoscopic surgery has the probability of causing complications. In order to avoid this, the risk factors after surgery were analyzed, and the drug-resistant bacteria were analyzed for accurate prevention and treatment. A total of 600 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery in our hospital from January 2017 to September 2021 were included in the study. The risk factors and pathogen distribution of pulmonary infection were analyzed. The risk factors of pulmonary infection after laparoscopic surgery were hypoproteinemia, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary disease history, and perioperative blood transfusion. The main pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The M protein is integrated into the viral envelope with three transmembrane domains flanked by a short amino-terminal ectodomain and a large carboxy-terminal endodomain. In this study, we showed co-purification of the M protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with actin. To understand the cellular factors that may be involved in virion assembly, budding and maturation processes, IBV M was used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, resulting in the identification of -actin as a potentially interacting partner. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy in mammalian cells, and mutation of amino acids A159 and K160 on the M protein abolished the interaction. Introduction of the A159-K160 mutation into an infectious IBV clone system blocks the infectivity of the clone, although viral RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription were actively detected. Disruption of actin filaments with cell-permeable agent cytochalasin D at early stages of the infection cycle led to the detection of viral protein synthesis in infected cells but not release of virus particles to the cultured media. However, the same treatment at late stages of the infection cycle did not affect the release of virus particles to the media, suggesting that disruption of the actin filaments might block virion assembly and budding, but not release of the virus particles.

Opioids are indispensable for pain management in palliative care and can usually be provided by the oral route, which is safe, effective, and of lowest cost in most cases. As patients near the end of life, however, the need for alternate routes of medication increases with up to 70% of patients requiring a nonoral route for opioid administration. In order to optimize patient care, it is imperative that clinicians understand existing available options of opioid administration and their respective advantages and disadvantages. METHODS We performed a literature review to describe the most commonly used and available routes that can substitute for oral opioid therapy and to provide a summary of factors affecting choice of opioid for use in palliative care in terms of benefits, indications, cautions, and general considerations. RESULTS Clinical circumstances will largely dictate appropriateness of the route selected. When the oral route is unavailable, subcutaneous, intravenous, and enteral routes are preferred in the palliative care population. The evidence supporting sublingual, buccal, rectal, and transdermal gel routes is mixed.

We conducted a two-phase project to develop validated versions of the CompACT in three languages: phase 1cross-cultural adaptation; and phase 2psychometric validation of the questionnaire for use in Italy, Germany and Spain. This article focuses on the first phase. Methods: We translated and culturally adapted the CompACT in the three target languages, following the ISPOR TCA Task Force guidelines. The process was overseen by a translation panel (three translators, at least two multiple sclerosis (MS) researchers and a lay person), ACT experts and clinicians from the research team of each country and the original CompACT developers. We debriefed the new questionnaire versions via face-to-face interviews with a minimum of four adults from the general population (GP) and four adults with MS in each country. Results: The translation-adaptation process went smoothly in the three countries, with some items (7 in Italy, 4 in Germany, 6 in Spain) revised after feedback from ACT experts. Cognitive debriefing showed that the CompACT was deemed easy to understand and score in each target country by both GP and MS adults.

Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, HAdV often is detected together with other virus species, even in healthy controls. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare molecular detection of HAdV with culture, and to examine the associations of various methods to RTI. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from 4319 children admitted with RTI and from 361 controls. The NPAs were examined for 23 viral and bacterial pathogens, using inhouse real-time PCR-assays based on TaqMan probes, in addition to bacterial and viral culture. HAdV concentration was evaluated semi-quantitatively from the Ct-value and quantitatively by use of ADENOVIRUS R-gene?. RESULTS: HAdV-DNA was detected in 6.1% patient samples and in 10.5% controls (p< 0.001). Compared to controls, patients had an OR of 3.8 (95% CI 1.4C10.3) for mono-detection of HAdV DNA, and an OR of 5.1 (95% CI 2.0C13.4) for HAdV-positive samples grew adenovirus by culture. HAdV DNA loads from children with RTI consisted of two clusters: one cluster with high viral loads (Ct < 30 and >106 copies/ml) and one cluster with low viral loads, whereas among the controls, nearly all had low viral loads (OR 7.8, 95% CI 2.2C27.1). In 61 available plasma samples, 16.4% were positive for HAdV DNA, all were from patients. CONCLUSION: The detection of HAdV DNA per se by qualitative PCR is not useful as a diagnostic test. Detection of HAdV by use of viral culture and a high viral HAdV DNA load are the two methods most strongly associated with RTI in children.","output":"Human adenovirus in nasopharyngeal and blood samples from children with and without respiratory tract infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity of and recommend indications for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter implantation during percutaneous endovenous intervention (PEVI) for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). BACKGROUND PEVI has emerged as a powerful tool in the management of acute proximal DVT. Instrumentation of extensive fresh thrombus is potentially associated with iatrogenic pulmonary embolism (PE). The true frequency of this complication has not been studied in a randomized fashion. We evaluated IVC filter implantation during PEVI for DVT. METHODS A total of 141 patients with symptomatic proximal DVT undergoing PEVI for symptomatic DVT were randomized to receive an IVC filter (70 patients) or no filter (71 patients; control group). The anticoagulation and PEVI regimen were similar between the two groups. Patients with development of symptoms suggestive of PE underwent objective testing for PE. RESULTS PE developed in 1 of the 14 symptomatic patients in the filter group and 8 of the 22 patients in the control group (P = 0.048). There was no mortality in any group. Three patients (4.2%) in the control group had transient hemodynamic instability necessitating resuscitory efforts. Predictors of iatrogenic PE were found to be PE at admission; involvement of two or more adjacent venous segments with acute thrombus; inflammatory form of DVT (severe erythema, edema, pain, and induration); and vein diameter of 7 mm with preserved architecture. CONCLUSIONS IVC filter implantation during PEVI reduces the risk of iatrogenic PE by eightfold without a mortality benefit.

Immunosuppressives and biological treatments multiply the chances of opportunistic and lung infections, especially in combination therapy, so due to the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) epidemic, which primarily causes respiratory disease, it is advisable to use different therapeutic considerations for effective and safe patient care. Contrary to the expectations, a study from Italy and China each, despite of the large number of infected cases, did not report any SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, which can be due to a number of favorable factors, such as the lower average age of the patients, lack of comorbidities, etc. However, it should not be forgotten that the patients on immunosuppressive and/or biological therapy belong to the compromised group. Consequently, in some cases there is a need to modify the therapy, but we should keep in mind that the relapse alongside with the need of medical consultation and even hospitalization elevate the chance of being infected. Thus, flare-ups ought to be avoided as far as they can be, so continuing the already started maintenance therapy can be a reasonable solution, but, in the high-risk group, modifying it can be reasonable as well.

We aim to demonstrate a novel technique of pure transvaginal laparoscopic ventral hernia repair in a series of patients performed in our institution. TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION The patient was placed in lithotomy position and steep Trendelenburg. A 2-cm transverse colpotomy incision was made and a SILS port was introduced. One 12-mm trocar and two 5-mm trocars were placed through the SILS port and standard straight laparoscopic instruments were used. An appropriately sized round mesh was deployed within a specimen retrieval bag into the peritoneal cavity. Complete anterior circumferential fixation of the mesh was achieved using an AbsorbaTack device. The colpotomy incision was closed. RESULTS There were a total of 6 pure transvaginal ventral hernia repair procedures performed in our institution between November 2010 and February 2012. The first case was converted to an open procedure after a rectal injury was recognized and repaired. Two patients had transient urinary retention that resolved after 24 hours. One patient had vaginal wound granulation noted at 2 months postoperatively. No long-term complications or recurrences were noted with a median follow-up of 9 months.

METHODS: The data were obtained from two independent sources: the Longitudinal Childhood Obesity Study (ELOIN) and the epidemiological surveillance system data from the Community of Madrid (Spain), which served to identify the population within the cohort with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 registry was cross-checked with the cohort population at 11C12 years of age. A total of 2018 eligible participants were identified in the cohort, who underwent physical examinations at 4, 6, and 9 years of age during which weight, height, and waist circumference were recorded. General obesity (GO) was determined according to the WHO-2007 criteria whereas abdominal obesity (AO) was defined based on the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. The relative risks (RRs) of infection were estimated using a Poisson regression model and adjusted by sociodemographic variables, physical activity, and perceived health reported by the parents. RESULTS: The accumulated incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 8.6% (95% CI: 7.3C9.8). The estimated RR of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2.53 (95% CI: 1.56C4.10) and 2.56 (95% CI: 1.55C4.21) for children 4C9 years old with stable GO and AO, respectively, compared with those who did not present GO.

We analysed the adherence to this regime in pandemic and regular circumstances. Methods: We compared the number of check-up visits, hospitalisations and respiratory samples taken in the pre-pandemic 2019 and the pandemic year 2020. Descriptive statistics and t-test (paired two sample for means) were used. Results: The sample consists of 93 patients (40 males, 52 adults), age range 2C36 yrs, median age in 2020: 19,5 yrs. Our goal of at least 4 visits/yr was not achieved for 29/93 patients in 2019. vs. 43/93 in the pandemic year. Although some patients visited the CF Centre more frequently in the pandemic year (15/93), most of them came less often. From a total of 93 patients seen in 2019, 12 did not have a check-up in 2020. Altogether, during the COVID-19 pandemic 2020. year we noticed a convincing, statistically significant trend in declining routine check-ups, as well as hospital admissions among cystic fibrosis patients in relation to pre-pandemic 2019 year (M = 5,20  3,19 vs. M = 3,87  2,88;t = 4,77, p < 0.001). This phenomenon, of course, entails a reduced, also statistically significant, number of respiratory cultures performed in pandemic 2020 year (M = 4,88  4,22 vs. M = 3,34  3,20;t = 5,29, p < 0.001). Conclusion: We definitely observed a negative trend in follow-ups of CF patients in the pandemic year. In our case it could also be partially caused by two serious earthquakes in the Zagreb area. Avoiding hospital arrivals and dropping out of usual follow-up practice due to fear of COVID-19 contagion may be responsible for more frequent CF exacerbations and poorer outcome for our patients in the future.

Traditional approaches include the transcranial route, which broaches the lateral wall of the CS and has a high risk of cranial nerve weakness. A medial approach is more logical but the microscopic transsphenoidal approach has a restricted view. The endoscopic endonasal approach provides an alternative medial approach with improved visualization to that provided with the microscope. We describe our results using this approach for resection of CS tumors. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients treated surgically at a tertiary care referral center between January 2004 and February 2011 with a purely endoscopic endonasal approach to the CS. RESULTS Out of 400 total endoscopic skull base cases, 41 (10.3%) involved the cavernous sinus. The most common approach was the transsphenoidal transsellar approach (31 patients, 75.6%). Other approaches included the tran-sethmoidal transsphenoidal parasellar (4 patients, 9.8%) and transmaxillary transpterygoidal (6 patients, 14.6%). The most common pathology was pituitary macroadenoma (24 patients, 58.5%). Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients (43.9%). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was not encountered in any patient postoperatively. Complications included 1 case of new postoperative VIth nerve palsy, 1 case of intraoperative hemorrhage, 2 cases of persistent diabetes insipidus, and 2 cases of sinusitis.

Italy was the first European country to experience SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, and one of the most severely affected during the first wave of diffusion. In contrast to the general restriction of people movements in Europe, the number of migrants arriving at Italian borders via the Mediterranean Sea route in the summer of 2020 had increased dramatically, representing a possible, uncontrolled source for the introduction of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Importantly, most of the migrants came from African countries showing limited SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological surveillance. In this study, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 genome isolated from an asymptomatic migrant arrived in Sardinia via the Mediterranean route in September 2020, in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 isolates arrived in Sicily through the Libyan migration route; with SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in Sardinia during 2020; and with viral genomes reported in African countries during the same summer. Results showed that our sequence is not phylogenetically related to isolates from migrants arriving in Sicily, nor to isolates circulating in Sardinia territory, having greater similarity to SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported in countries known for being sites of migrant embarkation to Italy. This is in line with the hypothesis that most SARS-CoV-2 infections among migrants have been acquired prior to embarking to Italy, possibly during the travel to or the stay in crowded Libyan immigrant camps.

Decreases in serum neutralizing antibody titers after vaccination against Delta were greater than those against Alpha but less than those against Beta. The protective efficacy of existing vaccines against the Delta variant have declined and is related to the number of doses and the time since vaccination. EXPERT OPINION: The currently used vaccines are effective against hospitalization/severe disease due to the Delta variant. Accelerating the popularization of vaccination, improving the coverage rate, and the implementation of intervention measures, such as wearing masks, are effective means to control the spread of the Delta variant and other variants.

Interventions that increase the rate of SICs between oncology clinicians and patients may improve goal-concordant care and patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a clinician-directed intervention integrating machine learning mortality predictions with behavioral nudges on motivating clinician-patient SICs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted across 20 weeks (from June 17 to November 1, 2019) at 9 medical oncology clinics (8 subspecialty oncology and 1 general oncology clinics) within a large academic health system in Pennsylvania. Clinicians at the 2 smallest subspecialty clinics were grouped together, resulting in 8 clinic groups randomly assigned to the 4 intervention wedge periods. Included participants in the intention-to-treat analyses were 78 oncology clinicians who received SIC training and their patients (N = 14 607) who had an outpatient oncology encounter during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: (1) Weekly emails to oncology clinicians with SIC performance feedback and peer comparisons; (2) a list of up to 6 high-risk patients (10% predicted risk of 180-day mortality) scheduled for the next week, estimated using a validated machine learning algorithm; and (3) opt-out text message prompts to clinicians on the patients appointment day to consider an SIC. Clinicians in the control group received usual care consisting of weekly emails with cumulative SIC performance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of patient encounters with an SIC in the intervention group vs the usual care (control) group. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 78 clinicians and 14 607 patients. The mean (SD) age of patients was 61.9 (14.2) years, 53.7% were female, and 70.4% were White. For all encounters, SICs were conducted among 1.3% in the control group and 4.6% in the intervention group, a significant difference (adjusted difference in percentage points, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.3-4.5; P < .001). Among 4124 high-risk patient encounters, SICs were conducted among 3.6% in the control group and 15.2% in the intervention group, a significant difference (adjusted difference in percentage points, 11.6; 95% CI, 8.2-12.5; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial, an intervention that delivered machine learning mortality predictions with behavioral nudges to oncology clinicians significantly increased the rate of SICs among all patients and among patients with high mortality risk who were targeted by the intervention. Behavioral nudges combined with machine learning mortality predictions can positively influence clinician behavior and may be applied more broadly to improve care near the end of life.

Mobility restrictions policies were the primary preventive measures applied around the globe. In addition to reducing the disease spread, they resulted in air quality changes in urbanized areas. In this sense, this study aimed to investigate how the mobility restrictions imposed by public policies impacted the air quality in Brazil during the COVID-19 2020 outbreak. Therefore, air quality (CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and O-3) and urban mobility datasets available in five populous Brazilian states (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, Parana, and Rio Grande do Sul) were analyzed. Variations in air pollutant concentrations were verified by comparing the period during mobility restrictions (2020) and the average concentrations found before the restrictions (2015-2019). In addition, spatial assessment of changes was evaluated using tropospheric NO2 column densities from the TROPOMI. Although there was no national regulation regarding mobility restrictions, the results show that the reduction in urban mobility was similar for all the analyzed states. Following the mobility behavior, reducing air pollutant concentrations were significant for the first 30 days of restrictions. During this period, the most substantial reductions were observed for CO in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (-53%), NO2 in Rio de Janeiro (-34%), and PM10 in Espirito Santo (-23%). The exception was observed for O-3, which followed the world trend of increasing concentrations (e.g., 40% increase in Parana). Spatially, it was possible to evidence that large urban centers (with a large vehicle fleet) were the ones that showed the most significant reduction in NO2. However, when analyzing longer periods (over 90 days), there is a trend towards an increase in the concentrations of primary pollutants and a consequent reduction in O-3, reflecting the significant increase in mobility rates.","output":"Impacts of Strategic Mobility Restrictions Policies during 2020 COVID-19 Outbreak on Brazil's Regional Air Quality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1. The spatial organization of populations determines their pathogen dynamics. This is particularly important for communally roosting species, whose aggregations are often driven by the spatial structure of their environment. 2. We develop a spatially explicit model for virus transmission within roosts of Australian tree\\\\dwelling bats (Pteropus spp.), parameterized to reflect Hendra virus. The spatial structure of roosts mirrors three study sites, and viral transmission between groups of bats in trees was modelled as a function of distance between roost trees. Using three levels of tree density to reflect anthropogenic changes in bat habitats, we investigate the potential effects of recent ecological shifts in Australia on the dynamics of zoonotic viruses in reservoir hosts. 3. We show that simulated infection dynamics in spatially structured roosts differ from that of mean\\\\field models for equivalently sized populations, highlighting the importance of spatial structure in disease models of gregarious taxa. Under contrasting scenarios of flying\\\\fox roosting structures, sparse stand structures (with fewer trees but more bats per tree) generate higher probabilities of successful outbreaks, larger and faster epidemics, and shorter virus extinction times, compared to intermediate and dense stand structures with more trees but fewer bats per tree. These observations are consistent with the greater force of infection generated by structured populations with less numerous but larger infected groups, and may flag an increased risk of pathogen spillover from these increasingly abundant roost types. 4. Outputs from our models contribute insights into the spread of viruses in structured animal populations, like communally roosting species, as well as specific insights into Hendra virus infection dynamics and spillover risk in a situation of changing host ecology.

The contribution of meteorological factors and emission reduction to air pollution change over the north of Morocco has been investigated in this study using the framework generalized additive models, that have been proved to be a robust technique for the environmental data sets, focusing on main atmospheric pollutants in the region including ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), particulate matter (PM(2.5) and PM(10)), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA), nom-methane volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide (CO) from the regional air pollution dataset of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. Our results, indicate that secondary air pollutants (PM(2.5), PM(10) and O(3)) are more influenced by metrological factors and the other air pollutants reported by this study (NO(2) and SO(2)). We show a negative effect for PBHL, total precipitation and NW10M on PM (PM(2.5) and PM(10)), this meteorological parameters contribute to decrease in PM(2.5) by 9, 2 and 9% respectively, before LCD and 8, 1 and 5% respectively during LCD. However, a positive marginal effect was found for SAT, Irradiance and RH that contribute to increase PM(2.5) by 9, 12 and 18% respectively, before LCD and 17, 54 and 34% respectively during LCD. We found also that meteorological factors contribute to O(3), PM(2.5), PM(10) and SIA average mass concentration by 22, 5, 3 and 34% before LCD and by 28, 19, 5 and 42% during LCD respectively. The increase in meteorological factors marginal effect during LCD shows the contribution of photochemical oxidation to air pollution due to increase in atmospheric oxidant (O(3) and OH radical) during LCD, which can explain the response of PM to emission reduction. This study indicates that PM (PM(2.5), PM(10)) has more controlled by SO(2) due to the formation of sulfate particles especially under high oxidants level. The positive correlation between westward wind at 10 m (WW10M), Northward Wind at 10 m (NW10M) and PM indicates the implication of sea salt particles transported from Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. The Ozone mass concentration shows a positive trend with Irradiance, Total and SAT during LCD; because temperature and irradiance enhance tropospheric ozone formation via photochemical reaction.This study shows the contribution of atmospheric oxidation capacity to air pollution change.

The uniqueness of this situation is not only that we can observe how selective breeding phenotypically and genetically changes successive generations, but also that it enables a comparison of farm minks with their feral counterparts. Such a comparison may thus provide valuable information regarding differences in natural selection and selective breeding. In our study, we found significant morphological differences between farm and feral minks as well as changes in body shape: trapezoidal in feral minks and rectangular in farm minks. Such a clear differentiation between the two populations over a period of several decades highlights the intensity of selective breeding in shaping the morphology of these animals and gives an indication of the speed of phenotypic changes and the species plasticity. This also suggests that the selective forces (selective breeding vs. natural selection) acting upon body dimensions of minks vary between feral and farm populations. ABSTRACT: In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of the morphological traits between feral (n = 43) and farm (n = 200) individuals of the American mink in Poland to address the question of how multigenerational intensive selective breeding has morphologically differentiated these two populations. Nine body measurements and two proportion coefficients were obtained using adult individuals. The significance of differences between population means was assessed using the Wilcoxon test for independent samples, while the KruskalCWallis test was used to compare sex-population groups. Spearmans correlation coefficients between measurements were estimated for each population. We also performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the variables that were most closely correlated with variation in the trait measurements and to investigate the morphological differences between farm and feral minks. We found that the farm minks exhibited significantly higher mean values for eight out of eleven studied traits. Moreover, significant changes in forelimb length, with no concomitant changes in hindlimb length, were accompanied by differences in body shape: trapezoidal in feral minks and rectangular in farm minks. The PCA suggested an almost complete separation of the two populations and indicated that sexes were quite separate; farm males in particular constitute a wholly discrete cluster. Such a clear differentiation between the two populations and sexes over a period of several decades highlights the intensity of selective breeding in shaping the morphology of these animals.","output":"How Selective Breeding Has Changed the Morphology of the American Mink (Neovison vison)A Comparative Analysis of Farm and Feral Animals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An endophytic fungus isolated from healthy leaf tissues of Houttuynia cordata Thunb., an ethnomedicinal plant of North East India, showed a considerable amount of antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the fungal culture filtrates displayed promising antimicrobial activity against a panel of clinically significant pathogens including Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bioassay guided purification of the organic extract using column and thin layer chromatography yielded a pure homogenous compound which was identified using spectroscopic methods (essentially by (1)H NMR and MS) as tyrosol, a well-known phenylethanoid present in several natural sources. Besides, molecular docking studies against tyrosyl tRNA synthetases (TyrRS) of S. aureus (PDB ID: 1JIL) and E. coli (PDB ID: 1VBM), and CYP45014-lanosterol demethylase (CYP51) of C. albicans (PDB ID: 5FSA) revealed tyrosol has a strong binding affinity with the enzyme active site residues.

Contemporary studies have found that the antibody titre levels in infected patients decrease over time. The recent discoveries of isolated but fully documented reinfection cases from around the world raise the question of what profile the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population.Methods: We employ mathematical modelling to answer the above question. We construct a novel delay differential equation model tailored to accommodate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) where a recovered case becomes completely susceptible after a given time interval following infection and (b) where a first-time recovered case becomes susceptible to a lower virulence infection after a given interval following recovery, and becomes permanently immunized by a second infection.Findings: Possible solutions to the above model exhibit a large number of waves of disease with the first immune response and two to three waves with the second. These multiple wave solutions are manifest only for some intermediate values of the reproduction number R, which is governed by public health intervention measures.

This is because the XNAs, especially the locked nucleic acid, the peptide nucleic acid, and the morpholino, have shown better single nucleobase mismatch discrimination capacity than the DNA capture probes, indicating their capacity for more precise detection of nucleic acid sequences, which is beneficial for detection of gene stretches having point mutations.

Methodology: In this pilot study, authors used the online available data sources of randomly selected 18 countries to collect ecological predictors of COVID-19 transmissibility and mortality. The studied determinants were environmental factors (daily average temperature, daily humidity) and socioeconomic attributes (population age structure, count and density, human development index, per capita income (PCI), gross domestic product, internet coverage, mobility trends, chronic diseases). Researchers used the linear and exponential time series analysis, and further utilize multivariate techniques to explain the variance in the monthly exponential growth rates of new cases and deaths. Result: In the first two months, the R2 of linear models for the cases and deaths were higher than that of the corresponding R2 of the exponential model. Later one, R2 of the exponential model was occasionally relatively higher than that of the linear models. The exponential growth rate of new cases was significantly associated with mobility trends (?=0.00398, P=0.002), temperature (?=0.000679, P=0.011), humidity (?=0.000249, P=0.000), and the proportion of patients aged above 65 years (?=-0.000959, P=0.012). Similarly, the exponential growth rate of deaths was significantly associated with mobility trends (?=0.0027, P=0.049), temperature (?=0.0014, P<0.001), humidity (?=-0.0026, P=0.000), and PCI of countries. During this period, COVID-19 transmissibility was evident to be controlled as soon as social mobility is decreased by about 40% of the baseline over 3 months controlling for the other predictors. Conclusion: Controlling of COVID-19 pandemic is based mainly on controlling social mobility. Role of environmental determinants like temperature and humidity was well noticed on disease fatality and transmissibility.

Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p < 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001).

However, production and utilization modes of IMP1 using Lactococcus lactis as delivery vector were not reported untill now. In the present study, Eimeria tenella IMP1 (EtIMP1) protein was expressed in L. lactis under the nisin-inducible promoter, and EtIMP1 protein was produced in cytoplasmic, cell wall-anchored and secreted forms. Each chicken was orally immunized with one of the three live EtIMP1-expressing lactococci three times at 2 weeks intervals (immunized group), or with live bacteria harboring empty vector (immunized control group). Chickens in immunized and immunized control group were challenged with E. tenella sporulated oocysts to assess the immune responses. The results showed that proliferative responses of peripheral blood T lymphocytes, mRNA expression levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-?3 in spleen tissues, levels of serum IgG and secretory IgA (sIgA) in cecal lavage fluids from chickens in immunized group were all significantly elevated compared to that in immunized control group. All three the live EtIMP1-expressing lactococci significantly decreased oocyst shedding, alleviated pathological damage in cecum and improved weight gain compared with bacteria harboring empty vector. These results suggested EtIMP1 protein delivered by L. lactis might be a promising candidate in developing novel vaccines against Eimeria infection.","output":"Eimeria tenella: IMP1 protein delivered by Lactococcus lactis induces immune responses against homologous challenge in chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to protect decedent privacy and to avoid the gratuitous use of photographs of death scenes and injuries by non-practitioners, professional meetings of forensic pathologists are never broadcast live to an audience beyond immediate conference attendees.

Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are being published daily in public databases and the availability of this genome datasets has allowed unprecedented access into the mutational patterns of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. We made use of the same genomic information for conducting phylogenetic analysis and identifying lineage-specific mutations. The catalogued lineage defining mutations were analysed for their stabilizing or destabilizing impact on viral proteins. We recorded persistence of D614G, S477N, A222V V1176F variants and a global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1. In addition, a retention of Q57H (B.1.X), R203K/G204R (B.1.1.X), T85I (B.1.2-B.1.3), G15S+T428I (C.X) and I120F (D.X) variations was observed. Overall, we recorded a striking balance between stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, therefore well-maintained protein structures. With selection pressures in the form of newly developed vaccines and therapeutics to mount soon in coming months, the task of mapping of viral mutations and recording of their impact on key viral proteins would be crucial to pre-emptively catch any escape mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 may evolve for. STUDY IMPORTANCE As large numbers of the SARS CoV-2 genome sequences are shared in publicly accessible repositories, it enables scientists a detailed evolutionary analysis since its initial isolation in Wuhan, China. We investigated the evolutionarily associated mutational diversity overlaid on the major phylogenetic lineages circulating globally, using 513 representative genomes. We detailed phylogenetic persistence of key variants facilitating global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1, including the recent, fast expanding, B.1.1.7 lineage. The stabilizing or destabilizing impact of the catalogued lineage defining mutations on viral proteins indicates their possible involvement in balancing the protein function and structure. A clear understanding of this mutational profile is of high clinical significance to catch any vaccine escape mechanism, as the same proteins make crucial components of vaccines recently approved and in development. In this direction, our study provides an imperative framework and baseline data upon which further analysis could be built as newer variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to appear.","output":"Evolutionary tracking of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants highlights an intricate balance of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El presente artculo busca describir las principales medidas de prevencin primaria sobre el COVID-19 que recientemente est afectando a nuestro pas, considerando aspectos epidemiolgicos y recomendaciones aplicadas y reportadas en otros pases.

The results are compared with the results of COVID-Net and various other state of the art Deep Learning models from the open-source community. Deep Learning tools are often referred to as black boxes because humans cannot interpret how or why a model is classifying an image into a particular class. This problem is addressed by testing VisionPro Deep Learning with two settings, firstly by selecting the entire image, that is, selecting the entire image as the Region of Interest-ROI, and secondly by segmenting the lungs in the first step, and then doing the classification step on the segmented lungs only, instead of using the entire image. VisionPro Deep Learning results-on the entire image as the ROI it achieves an overall F-score of 94.0 percent, and on the segmented lungs, it gets an F-score of 95.3 percent, which is at par or better than COVID-Net and other state of the art open-source Deep Learning models.","output":"Identification of images of COVID-19 from Chest X-rays using Deep Learning: Comparing COGNEX VisionPro Deep Learning 1.0 Software with Open Source Convolutional Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacterial infections are a prevalent complication after primary viral respiratory infections and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Antibiotics are widely used against bacterial respiratory pathogens; however, the rise in antibiotic-resistant strains urges us to search for new antimicrobial compounds, including ones that act synergistically with antibiotics. In this study, the minimal inhibitory (MIC) and minimal bactericidal (MBC) concentrations of a polyphenol-rich complex of green propolis, Tabebuia avellanedae bark, and Olea europaea leaf extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were determined, followed by an analysis of the synergistic effect with clarithromycin, azithromycin, and amoxiclav (875/125 mg amoxicillin/clavulanic acid). A combination of extracts showed activity against all three bacterial strains, with MIC values ranging from 0.78 to 12.5 mg/mL and MBC values from 1.56 to 12.5 mg/mL. The extracts showed synergistic activity with azithromycin and clarithromycin against S. aureus, with clarithromycin against K. pneumoniae, and with all three tested antibiotics against H. influenzae. Synergy with clarithromycin was additionally evaluated in a time-kill assay where the synergistic effects against S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were seen within the first 6 h of incubation.

The aim of this study is to describe the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on a third-level referral center for pancreatic surgery in Italy. METHODS: The 2020 activity of The Pancreas Institute of the University of Verona was reviewed, comparing different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks using the pre-COVID era as a control. Endpoints were the overall caseload of pancreatic resections, surgical waiting list, administration of preoperative therapy, major morbidity and mortality, residents training; number of inpatients beds, outpatient visits/procedures/diagnostics. RESULTS: In 2020, there was an overall significant reduction of pancreatic resections performed (394 vs. 506 in 2019), particularly during the first (MarchCMay) and second (OctoberCDecember) COVID-19 outbreaks, with an all-time-low of 16 resections/months in April (compared to 43 average resection/month in 2019). The rates of major morbidity (ClavienCDindo  3) and mortality were similar to 2019 (16 vs 12%, p = 0.11 and 3 vs 2%, p = 0.29, respectively). During the first and second outbreaks residents training, inpatient beds, outpatient visits, diagnostics, and procedures were severely impaired, while the waiting list for up-front cancer resections and the use of preoperative chemotherapy concomitantly raised.

Despite the Indonesian Governments ongoing effort to impose regulation for collaborative TB-DM management, the involvement of private primary care providers (PPCs) has not been considered before the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to capture the PPCs existing practices and explore their challenges, opportunities, and potential roles in the collaborative TB-DM services and control. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative research design was used to collect data. Two Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 13 healthcare workers (HCWs) from different private clinics and eight private/solo general practitioners (GPs) from Yogyakarta City, Indonesia. We triangulated these data with data from FGDs of HCWs community health centers (CHCs) and in-depth interviews of three regional health regulators, five hospitals staff members, and a representative of national health insurance. The discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: PPCs have not been initiated into the implementation of the collaborative TB-DM programme. The themes identified in this study were health system-related barriers, knowledge and perception of HCWs, lack of implementation of bi-directional screening, and needs of multisector role. The potential roles identified for PPCs include involvement in health promotion, bi-directional screening, patient referral, and data reporting according to the TB-DM programme indicators. However, more thorough improvement of PPCs capacity and logistic supplies are needed to provide comprehensive TB treatment. CONCLUSION: Although PPCs involvement in implementing collaborative TB-DM services has yet to be considered, their potential role should not be neglected. Therefore, it is essential to increase their involvement by enhancing their capacity and improving the Public-Private Mix.

METHODS: Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. RESULTS: The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe.

This retrospective prospective cohort study was conducted on 150 ADHD children and adolescents that had previously attended the child unit of the Psychiatry Department, Zagazig University Hospitals, Sharkia, Egypt, and diagnosed as ADHD patients using the research diagnostic criteria of DSM-5 which administrated by experienced psychiatrists and evaluated by The Arabic version of Conners Parent Rating Scale Revised-short version (CPRS-48) before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. We collected the other data of the study by applying an Arabic language questionnaire which included the data related to the COVID -19 pandemic and the Arabic version of CPRS-48 by which we reevaluated the behavioral symptoms of the subjects who participated in the study during COVID-19 pandemic. This research aimed to evaluate the behavioral symptoms among ADHD children and adolescents and detect the change in these symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing them before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: One hundred fifty ADHD children were included in the study with a mean age of 10 years old. The male gender was predominant and represented 76.7% of the sample. Ninety percent were living in urban areas with more low social class (50%), 84.7% of parents were married, 60% of the family member of our subjects had COVID-19 while 12% lost one or more of their relative by the pandemic (64.7%). The fathers continued working as normal, while 40.7% of the mothers stopped working because of COVID-19. 62.7% of the parents were verbally and physically abusive to their children. Unfortunately, 100% of the subjects stopped attending their behavioral therapy center, 96.0% stopped their Follow up with a psychiatrist, and 55% stopped complying with their medications. As we presumed, we found a statistically significant change in the behavioral and psychological symptoms measured by Conners Parent Rating Scale Revised-short version (CPRS-48) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period before. The worsening of the symptoms was associated with age, sex, residency, social class, father and mother present working and couple status, having positive cases or losses of COVID-19 among family members, and patient maltreatment. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, this study suggests that the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened symptoms in a significant number of children and adolescents with ADHD, which needs clinical attention. Moreover, the patients psychiatric follow-up and compliance with their medications were markedly affected. Additionally, the lockdown has also led to an increase in the abusive behavior of the parents towards their children.","output":"Behavioral symptoms among children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during COVID-19 outbreak: a retrospective prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has posed a serious threat to global public health security With the increase in the number of confirmed cases globally, the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of COVID-19 an international public health emergency Despite atypical pneumonia as the primary symptom, liver dysfunction has also been observed in many clinical cases and is associated with the mortality risk in patients with COVID-19, like severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome Here we will provide a schematic overview of the clinical characteristics and the possible mechanisms of liver injury caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, which may provide help for optimizing the management of liver injury and reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients","output":"Clinical features and potential mechanism of coronavirus disease 2019-associated liver injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To synthesize evidence from studies that analyzed the associations between sedentary behavior and motor competence in children and adolescents. METHODS: Systematic review of original articles that analyzed possible associations between sedentary behavior and motor competence in children and adolescents (3C18 years of age), without restrictions on study design, instruments and analysis protocols. The articles were identified through searches in the PubMed, Web of Science, Academic Search Premier, Cinahl, Medline and SPORTDiscus databases, as well as in reference lists. The level of evidence was evaluated according to the amount of studies that reported statistical significance in the associations between the variables and the quality of the articles (risk of bias). RESULTS: Of 2,462 initial studies, 22 composed the synthesis (two interventions, nine longitudinal and eleven cross-sectional studies). Of these, in 13, we observed negative associations between the variables, more often in the age group of seven to fourteen years. In the analysis of risk of bias, the main limitations of the studies were convenience sampling and no description of sample sizing. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests that sedentary behavior is negatively associated with motor competence in elementary school children, although the evidence is uncertain in the preschool years; the synthesis of results from longitudinal studies suggests that sedentary behavior negatively affects the development of motor competence.

A cadaveric temporal bone was used to simulate droplet spread during suctioning of fluorescein-labelled middle ear fluid and visualized with a blue-light filter. RESULTS: A 23-year-old male who presented with complicated acute otitis media with facial paralysis was found to have an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, with positive viral PCR of nasopharyngeal swab, and a negative PCR of the middle ear fluid. He was placed on isolation precautions and treated with myringotomy, topical and systemic antibiotics, and antivirals. Consistent with observations during endonasal suctioning, suctioning of middle ear fluid was not found to be aerosol or droplet generating.

For a normal cellular immune response, the following conditions must be fulfilled: (1) accumulation of white blood cells, (2) their diapedesis through the vessel walls of the inflammatory area affected by an injurious agent, and (3) normal cellular effector functions in the tissue. This cascade of inflammatory processes has recently been shown to be regulated by a group of molecules that are termed adhesion molecules and consist of three subfamilies: selectins, the immunoglobulin supergene family, and integrins. The cellular functions influenced by adhesion molecules include, among others, cytotoxic T-cell responses, CD4-dependent activation of B lymphocytes by T lymphocytes, activation of granulocytes and macrophages, phagocytosis of opsonized particles by monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, antigen-presenting function of macrophages, their antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, initiation of a respiratory burst by white blood cells, and activation of fibroblasts. Studies performed in recent years have shown that pathogenetically relevant changes in the expression and function of adhesion molecules are involved in a variety of pulmonary diseases. These changes include the accumulation and activation of alveolar macrophages in smokers, experimentally induced bronchial hyperreactivity in bronchial asthma, accumulation of eosinophils in allergic rhinitis, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, binding of viruses and bacteria to respiratory mucosa, and various mechanisms of acute damage to pulmonary parenchyma. Though their role in tumor development is still unclear, adhesion molecules are obviously involved in determining the route and organotropism of metastases.

The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494, and asparagine by valine or threonine at position 501. Substitutions at positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin.

Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is the most severe and potentially fatal form. Anticoagulants used in prophylactic or therapeutic doses are discussed to potentially exert beneficial effects in patients with sepsis and/or SIC; however, due to the lack of evidence recent guidelines are limited to recommendations for drug prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE), while treatment of SIC has not been addressed. METHODS: In order to determine the status quo of VTE prophylaxis as well as treatment of SIC in German intensive care units (ICU), we conducted a Germany-wide online survey among heads of ICUs from October 2019 to May 2020. In April 2020, the survey was supplemented by an additional block of questions on VTE prophylaxis and SIC treatment in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. RESULTS: A total of 67 senior doctors took part in the survey. The majority (na?= 50; 74.6%) of the responses were from ICU under the direction of an anesthesiologist and/or a department of anesthesiology. Most of the participants worked either at a university hospital (na?= 31; 47.8%) or an academic teaching hospital (na?= 27; 40.3%). The survey results show a pronounced heterogeneity in clinical practice with respect to the prophylaxis of VTE as well as SIC treatment. In an exemplary case of pneumogenic sepsis, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) were by far the most frequently mentioned group of medications (na?= 51; 76.1% of the responding ITS). In the majority of cases (na?= 43; 64.2%), anti-FXa activity is not monitored with the use of LMWH in prophylaxis doses. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) was listed as a strategy for VTE prophylaxis in 37.3% of the responses (na?= 25). In an exemplary case of abdominal sepsis 54.5% of the participants (na?= 36; multiple answers possible) stated the use of UFH or LMWH and UFH with dosage controlled by PTT is used on two participating ICUs. The anti-FXa activity under prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH is monitored in 7 participating clinics (10.6%) in abdominal sepsis. Systematic screening for sepsis-associated coagulation disorders does not take place in most hospitals and patterns in the use of anticoagulants show significant variability between ICUs. In the case of COVID-19 patients, it is particularly noticeable that in three quarters of the participating ICUs the practice of drug-based VTE prophylaxis and SIC treatment does not differ from that of non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of answers collected in the survey suggests that a systematic approach to this topic via clinical trials is urgently needed to underline individualized patient care with the necessary evidence.","output":"[Treatment of sepsis-induced coagulopathy : Results of a Germany-wide survey in intensive care units]./ Therapie der sepsisinduzierten Koagulopathie : Ergebnisse einer deutschlandweiten Umfrage auf Intensivstationen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevalence has caused many problems in society and disrupted many regular aspects of life.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a promising treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults who do not respond to pharmacological or behavioral interventions. In contrast, rTMS has not demonstrated the same degree of efficacy in adolescent MDD. We argue that this is due, in part, to conceptual and methodological shortcomings in the existing literature. In our review, we first provide a neurodevelopmentally focused overview of adolescent depression. We then summarize the rTMS literature in adult and adolescent MDD focusing on both the putative mechanisms of action and neurodevelopmental factors that may influence efficacy in adolescents. We then identify limitations in the existing adolescent MDD rTMS literature and propose specific parameters and approaches that may be used to optimize efficacy in this uniquely vulnerable age group. Specifically, we suggest ways in which future studies reduce clinical and neural heterogeneity, optimize neuronavigation by drawing from functional brain imaging, apply current knowledge of rTMS parameters and neurodevelopment, and employ an experimental therapeutics platform to identify neural targets and biomarkers for response. We conclude that rTMS is worthy of further investigation.

Participants underwent a 3-minute active stand (AS) with Finapres(R) NOVA, followed by a 10-minute unmedicated 70-degree head-up tilt test. 85 participants were included (mean age 46 years, range 25-78; 74% women), of which 56 (66%) reported OI during AS (OIAS). OIAS seemed associated with female sex, more fatigue and depressive symptoms, and greater inability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), as well as a higher heart rate (HR) at the lowest systolic blood pressure (SBP) point before the 1st minute post-stand (mean HRnadir: 88 vs 75 bpm, P=0.004). In a regression model also including age, sex, fatigue, depression, ADL inability, and peak HR after the nadir SBP, HRnadir was the only OIAS predictor (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18, P=0.027). 22 participants had initial (iOH) and 5 classical (cOH) orthostatic hypotension, but neither correlated with OIAS. 71 participants proceeded to tilt, of which 28 had OI during tilt (OItilt). Of the 53 who had a 10-minute tilt, 7 (13%) fulfilled hemodynamic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) criteria, but 6 did not report OItilt. OIAS was associated with a higher initial HR on AS, which after 1 minute equalized with the non-OIAS group. Despite these initial orthostatic HR differences, POTS was infrequent and largely asymptomatic.

The goal of the study was to determine whether exposure is important by assessing the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in HCWs. The study was conducted between November 2020 and June 2021. HCWs in the major hospitals where COVID-19 cases were being cared for in the capital city, Bamako, Mali, were recruited. During the study period, vaccinations were not yet available. The ELISA of the IgG against the spike protein was optimized and quantitatively measured. A total of 240 HCWs were enrolled in the study, of which seropositivity was observed in 147 cases (61.8%). A continuous increase in the seropositivity was observed, over time, during the study period, from 50% at the beginning to 70% at the end of the study. HCWs who provided direct care to COVID-19 patients and were potentially highly exposed did not have the highest seropositivity rate. Vulnerable HCWs with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and asthma had even higher seropositivity rates at 77.8%, 75.0%, and 66.7%, respectively. Overall, HCWs had high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, likely reflecting a herd immunity level, which could be protective at some degrees.

If under these constrained conditions the hypothesis still holds, then many small and medium-sized organizations could identify fast and consequently utilize their own superforecasters. In this study, we provide supportive empirical evidence from an experiment with an initial (small) pool of 314 experts and an identification phase of (just) 9 months.

However, its dual role in both the activation and suppression of innate immune responses makes it very difficult to use the results from gathered basic research and apply them to the development of clinical trials. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the knowledge of the function of TLR2 in innate immunity and metabolism to provide some future research directions. ABSTRACT: Innate immunity is considered the first line of defense against microbial invasion, and its dysregulation can increase the susceptibility of hosts to infections by invading pathogens. Host cells rely on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize invading pathogens and initiate protective innate immune responses. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is believed to be among the most important Toll-like receptors for defense against mycobacterial infection. TLR2 has been reported to have very broad functions in infectious diseases and also in other diseases, such as chronic and acute inflammatory diseases, cancers, and even metabolic disorders. However, TLR2 has an unclear dual role in both the activation and suppression of innate immune responses. Moreover, in some studies, the function of TLR2 was shown to be controversial, and therefore its role in several diseases is still inconclusive. Therefore, although TLR2 has been shown to have an important function in innate immunity, its usefulness as a therapeutic target in clinical application is still uncertain. In this literature review, we summarize the knowledge of the functions of TLR2 in hostCmycobacterial interactions, discuss controversial results, and suggest possibilities for future research.","output":"The Role of TLR2 in Infectious Diseases Caused by Mycobacteria: From Cell Biology to Therapeutic Target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adverse events and childhood trauma increase the susceptibility towards developing psychiatric disorders (substance use disorder, anxiety, depression, etc.) in adulthood. Although there are treatment strategies that have utility in combating these psychiatric disorders, little attention is placed on how to therapeutically intervene in children exposed to early life stress (ELS) to prevent the development of later psychopathology. The lateral habenula (LHb) has been a topic of extensive investigation in mental health disorders due to its prominent role in emotion and mood regulation through modulation of brain reward and motivational neural circuits. Importantly, rodent models of ELS have been shown to promote LHb dysfunction. Moreover, one of the potential mechanisms contributing to LHb neuronal and synaptic dysfunction involves endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, which has been observed to critically regulate emotion/mood and motivation. Many pre-clinical studies targeting eCB signaling suggest that this neuromodulatory system could be exploited as an intervention therapy to halt maladaptive processes that promote dysfunction in reward and motivational neural circuits involving the LHb. In this perspective article, we report what is currently known about the role of eCB signaling in LHb function and discuss our opinions on new research directions to determine whether the eCB system is a potentially attractive therapeutic intervention for the prevention and/or treatment of ELS-associated psychiatric illnesses.","output":"Targeting Endocannabinoid Signaling in the Lateral Habenula as an Intervention to Prevent Mental Illnesses Following Early Life Stress: A Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reviews current scientific information about the duration of immunity induced in dogs by infection or vaccination.

General stressors include unmanageable workloads and staff shortages. Stressors specific to palliative care include regular exposure to death, loss and grief. The COVID pandemic exacerbated exhaustion and burnout across the healthcare system, including for those providing palliative care. Evidence based psychological support interventions, tailored to the needs and context of palliative care workers, are needed. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an established form of cognitive behavioural therapy which uses behavioural psychology, values, acceptance, and mindfulness techniques to improve mental health and wellbeing. ACT is effective in improving workplace wellbeing in many occupational settings. Our study examines the acceptability and feasibility of an online ACT-based intervention to improve mental health and wellbeing in staff caring for people with an advanced progressive illness. Methods A single-arm feasibility trial. We will seek to recruit 30 participants to take part in an 8- week online ACT-based intervention, consisting of three synchronous facilitated group sessions and five asynchronous self-directed learning modules. We will use convergent mixed methods to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention.

As such, detailed characterization of antibody-antigen binding provides important information to guide development. Due to the time and expense required, high-resolution structural characterization techniques are typically used sparingly and late in a development process. Here, we show that antibody-antigen binding can be characterized early in a process for whole panels of antibodies by combining experimental and computational analyses of competition between monoclonal antibodies for binding to an antigen. Experimental \\"epitope binning\\" of monoclonal antibodies uses high-throughput surface plasmon resonance to reveal which antibodies compete, while a new complementary computational analysis that we call \\"dock binning\\" evaluates antibody-antigen docking models to identify why and where they might compete, in terms of possible binding sites on the antigen. Experimental and computational characterization of the identified antigenic hotspots then enables the refinement of the competitors and their associated epitope binding regions on the antigen. While not performed at atomic resolution, this approach allows for the group-level identification of functionally related monoclonal antibodies (i.e., communities) and identification of their general binding regions on the antigen. By leveraging extensive epitope characterization data that can be readily generated both experimentally and computationally, researchers can gain broad insights into the basis for antibody-antigen recognition in wide-ranging vaccine and immunotherapy discovery and development programs.","output":"Characterizing Epitope Binding Regions of Entire Antibody Panels by Combining Experimental and Computational Analysis of Antibody: Antigen Binding Competition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Different pathogens can cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), however the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has re-emphasized the important role of respiratory viruses as a cause of CAP.

Fat (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were assessed with bioelectrical impedance analysis. Physical activity and capacity were assessed using questionnaires and grip strength. Plasma (p)-glucose, p-lipids, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), p-adiponectin, and cytokines were measured. Findings: Among 164 patients with CAP, etiology did not affect admission levels of glucose, HbA1c, adiponectin, or lipids. Overall, 152% had known diabetes, 61% had undiagnosed diabetes, 513% had pre-diabetes, 81% had hyperglycemia, and 60% had low HDL-cholesterol, with no difference between groups.

We demonstrate a case of post COVID-19 cholangiopathy with prolonged hyperbilirubinemia partially responsive to ursodiol. Case Description/Methods: Patient is a 59-year-old male presented with weakness and COVID-19 infection. His clinical course continued to deteriorate with multi-organ failure. After a prolonged ICU course, patient's respiratory failure improved, but had a persistent hyperbilirubinemia. Patient underwent ERCP showing a normal-appearing common bile duct with no evidence of any filling defects. He underwent autoimmune workup with positive ASMA with a titer 1:20, but negative ANA and AMA. HIDA scan showed poor clearance and no activity within the biliary tree, suggestive of underlying intrinsic hepatic abnormality. MRCP showed innumerable cystic dilation and areas of narrowing. Liver biopsy showed extensive cholestatic changes, perisinusoidal and bridging fibrosis, and iron deposition primarily within Kupffer cells. Repeat ERCP showed diffuse intrahepatic cholangiopathy in a pattern most consistent with PSC. Patient was started on ursodiol 250 mg three times a day with a mild improvement of bilirubin levels of about 25%. After a 6-month hospital course, patient was discharged to an acute care facility. Upon discharge, patient remained jaundice with persistent liver enzymes and a bilirubin of 21 mg/dL. Discussion: We described a case of an individual who recovered from severe sepsis secondary to COVID-19 developing significant post COVID-19 cholangiopathy. Despite recovery, patient continued to have chronic cholestasis and liver injury. Liver biopsy demonstrated predominant cholangiocyte injury with bridging fibrosis consistent with progression of secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SCC). Based on histopathological changes, it is postulated that damage occurs secondary to direct bile duct ischemia. While no standard therapies exist and only 1 case report showing post COVID-19 liver transplantion, many therapeutic options are limited. However, in our case, ursodiol demonstrated a significant improvement with a plateau of about 25% of the total bilirubin level.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is associated with a high mortality rate and recurrent hospitalizations. PURPOSE: To present the first data of the patients using Satelia? Cardio solution METHOD: Satelia? Cardio is a HF patient management solution with a remote monitoring system and a therapeutic guidance by a dedicated-nurse phone platform, supported by the ETAPES Program. The system is accessible from any device and requiring no installation. After the inclusion, the patient is contacted by the nurse, he then receives an SMS alerts following cardiologist prescription (on regular basis), with a link leading to a web page on which he will answer 7 questions and enter his current body weight. Satelia? Cardio algorithm is based on these data inputs, their variability, and the weight. In case of worsening of symptoms, the cardiologist will be notified. Since Covid-19 lockdown, more than 1400 patients have been monitored with the solution. RESULTS: 165 centers (306 cardiologists) are using Satelia? Cardio with 3540 HF patients monitored in the last 29 months. The patients with a mean age of 72 years (19-100) are predominantly males (67%), and mostly NYHA II/III (69%/31%) with a mean LVEF of 40%. The adherence to the system is very good (91%) with 78% of patients still monitored (n = 2787). The main reasons for stopping are related to the occurrence of death (205/753) or patient/HCP decision (392/753), or other reasons (156/753). Over the period of analysis, the HF patients answered to 163 700 questionnaires, generating 8210 alerts transmitted to the referent cardiologists. CONCLUSION: Patient management solution with a remote monitoring system is key to improving the follow-up of HF patients. The solution Satelia? Cardio is an easy way to use a web application to monitor HF patients, especially on the current period of Covid-19 with a low rate of premature discontinuation.

We also focused on 478 vertigo/dizziness outpatients between March 01, 2019, and May 31, 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, to compare the number of cancellations between these 2 periods. The reasons for cancellation and noncancellation were investigated using telephone multiple-choice questionnaires (telMCQs), particularly for patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Meniere's disease (MD). RESULTS There were many cancellations for medical examinations during the 2020 study period. The total number of vertigo/dizziness outpatients decreased by 44.6% in the 2020 period compared to the same period in 2019. The percent reduction in clinic attendance from 2019 to 2020 (ie, [2019-2020]/2019) for patients with BPPV was higher than that for patients with MD. Compared to the other vertigo-associated conditions, patients with MD exhibited a lower percent reduction in clinic attendance. According to the results of the telMCQs, 75.0% of BPPV cases and 88.2% of MD cases cancelled their appointment and gave up visiting hospitals due to fear of COVID-19 infection, even if they had moderate to severe symptoms. On the contrary, 25.0% and 80.0% patients with BPPV and MD, respectively, did not cancel their appointment; they should not have visited the hospital but stayed at home because they had slight symptoms. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that advanced forms should be prepared for medical care, such as remote medicine. These forms should not only be for the disease itself but also for the mental distress caused by persistent symptoms.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Follow-Ups for Vertigo/Dizziness Outpatients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The qualitative research participants were 15 mothers, had children, and did not work.

Although the biological properties and safety of the representative Kampo compounds, hochuekkito (HET) and kakkonto (KKT), have been confirmed in various animal model experiments, clinical studies, and a few human studies to induce biological effects on various infectious diseases without significant toxicity, it is unclear whether HET and KKT are safe and effective for COVID-19 prevention. The study population included healthcare workers (HCWs), as they are at a higher risk of infection than the other populations. We retrospectively investigated the immunological and preventive effects of HET and KTT against COVID-19. We included 27 HCWs (aged 21C72 years, F:M = 18:9) from hospitals and clinics of the Hokuriku-Tokai region. The HCWs received HET and KKT for general fatigue and myalgia during this period for 28 days. We obtained patient clinical data from electronic medical records. We analyzed the changes in immunomodulation before and after the administration of the formulas from residual specimens based on the expression of relevant surface markers. The specimens were also tested for the presence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The following side effects were reported: abdominal discomfort in five patients, diarrhea in two, and loose or soft stool in three. All 27 HCWs tested negative for COVID-19 antibodies. HET and KKT administration significantly increased the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes expressing the activating receptors NKp46, NKp30, and suppressing receptor NKG2A. There was also a significant increase in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes expressing the receptors TLR4, OX40, 4C1BB, GITR, PD-1, and ICOS. These data indicate that HET and KKT can enhance and modulate NK activity in circulating human immune cells. The immunomodulatory effects, such as activation and regulation of T cells, are consistent with a putative improvement in infectious immunosurveillance. An increase in the number of T cells and CD4/CD8-positive cells indicates an enhanced ability to protect against infection. HET and KKT may prevent the onset or worsening of COVID-19 through their immunomodulatory effects.","output":"Immunological and Preventive Effects of Hochuekkito and Kakkonto Against Coronavirus Disease in Healthcare Workers: A Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sledding is the most popular activity in young children given its cost and simplicity.

In addition atypical presentations may confuse and mislead physician to do different diagnostic procedures and interventions. We report a 6 years and half old boy with diarrhea, abdominal pain with first diagnosis acute abdomen due to acute appendicitis. At last diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis due to enterocolitis was confirmed. CASE PRESENTATION: A 6 years and half old boy with severe abdominal pain admitted in emergency ward. He had history of fever, nine days of diarrhea and recurrent vomiting. The abdominal pain was severe with moderate tenderness in right lower quadrant. He admitted in pediatric surgery ward after surgical consultation for rolling out acute appendicitis. The results of first lab studies were shown leucopenia, lymphopenia and COVID 19 PCR was positive. During admission the cough has increased and abdominal distention has evolved. Vomiting was intractable and feeding was impossible. Pneumatosis intestinalis in ascending colon and dilatation in colon caliber were detected abdominal. Miliary like pattern in lung has reported in chest CT. Stool exam results revealed loss of protein in high amount in spite of normal pancreatic and enterocyte function. The calprotectin was high and implied high inflammation in large intestine. With all above data necrotizing enterocolitis management was started.

We aim to develop a model helping planners assess expected COVID-19 hospital resource utilization based on individual patient characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop a model of patient clinical course based on an advanced multistate survival model. The model predicts the patient's disease course in terms of clinical states-critical, severe, or moderate. The model also predicts hospital utilization on the level of entire hospitals or healthcare systems. We cross-validated the model using a nationwide registry following the day-by-day clinical status of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel from March 1st to May 2nd, 2020 (n = 2,703). RESULTS: Per-day mean absolute errors for predicted total and critical-care hospital-bed utilization were 4.72  1.07 and 1.68  0.40 respectively, over cohorts of 330 hospitalized patients; AUCs for prediction of critical illness and in-hospital mortality were 0.88  0.04 and 0.96  0.04, respectively. We further present the impact of patient influx scenarios on day-by-day healthcare system utilization. We provide an accompanying R software package. DISCUSSION: The proposed model accurately predicts total and critical-care hospital utilization. The model enables evaluating impacts of patient influx scenarios on utilization, accounting for the state of currently hospitalized patients and characteristics of incoming patients. We show that accurate hospital-load predictions were possible using only a patient's age, sex, and day-by-day clinical state (critical, severe or moderate).

This study aimed to explore psychological adjustment processes of Spanish adolescents and their parents during the first month of lockdown by analyzing their narratives, perceived outcomes, protection and risk factors. A total of 142 people agreed to participate in this study. Of all participants, 61 were adolescents (M = 13.57; SD = 1.74; 57% women) and 81 were parents (M = 46.09; SD = 4.72; 91% mothers). All were Spanish residents and completed an online survey during the domestic lockdown in March 2020. From a qualitative design, methodology followed a mixed approach to analyze data. The results showed three different types of adaptation to lockdown and social isolation in both adolescents and their parents: 1) positive adjustment, 2) moderate adjustment, and 3) maladjustment. Most participants reported a good adjustment and only a 20% of parents and a 16% of adolescents stated that they had not been able to achieve a positive psychological adjustment. There are few significant quantitative differences between adolescents and their parents. The qualitative analysis of data showed that adolescents reported less psychological distress than their parents. The two most important protective factors were social support and keeping busy during lockdown. The most significant risk factors were loss of mobility and social isolation. The conclusions stressed that regarding psychological maladjustment, parents experienced feelings of uncertainty whereas adolescents experienced a kind of mourning process.

The data were collected in two stages: at the first stage, there were 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in Russia, but no cases had yet been recorded in the Sverdlovsk region;at the second stage, the number of cases reached 1952 in the Sverdlovsk region and 221 344 throughout the country. The study used the word association tests, The Semantic Differential Scale (V.F. Petrenko), The Psychic Activation Assessment Methodology (L.A. Kurgan and T.A.

The core of the social representation is sustainable and coherent. It reflects the results of the media impact: death, panic. It also remains stable regardless of the time and involvement of the respondents in the pandemic. The potential alteration zone serves as a kind of 'taming' of knowledge about the coronavirus, the operationalization of the coronavirus perception content into the language of changes in a person's everyday life-the coronavirus pandemic is understood as a 'flu epidemic' and the need for self-isolation is a 'vacation', an opportunity 'to stay at home'. Observation of the immediate affective reaction of the respondents to the trigger 'coronavirus' uncovered the presence of emotional tension and the prevalence of negative experiences in them.

Methods: We synthesized 41 peptides ranging in size from 16 to 25 amino acid residues of relatively high hydrophilicity. The immunoreactivities of the peptides with SARS patient sera were determined by ELISA. Results: Four epitopic sites, S599, M137, N66, and N371-404, located in the SARS-coronavirus S, M, and N proteins, respectively, were detected by screening synthesized peptides. Notably, N371 and N385, located at the COOH terminus of the N protein, inhibited binding of antibodies to SARS-coronavirus lysate and bound to antibodies in >94% of samples from SARS study patients. N385 had the highest affinity for forming peptide-antibody complexes with SARS serum.

Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholine-esterase inhibitor, increases the half-life of endogenous ACh, chemically stimulating the inflammatory reflex. This trial aimed to evaluate whether pyridostigmine could decrease invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: We performed a parallel-group, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate if add-on pyridostigmine to standard treatment reduced the composite outcome of initiation of IMV and 28-day all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define the prevalence of autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFN in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with IFN-beta-1b during hospitalization and to analyze their impact on various clinical variables and outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed stored serum/plasma samples and clinical data of COVID-19 patients treated subcutaneously with IFN-beta-1b from March to May 2020, at the Infanta Leonor University Hospital in Madrid, Spain. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 47 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, 16 of whom (34%) had a critical progression requiring ICU admission. The median age was 71 years, with 28 men (58.6%). Type I IFN-alpha- and omega-neutralizing autoantibodies were found in 5 of 47 patients with severe pneumonia or critical disease (10.6%), while they were not found in any of the 118 asymptomatic controls (p = 0.0016). The autoantibodies did not neutralize IFN-beta. No demographic, comorbidity, or clinical differences were seen between individuals with or without autoantibodies. We found a significant correlation between the presence of neutralizing autoantibodies and higher C-reactive protein levels (p = 5.10e-03) and lower lymphocyte counts (p = 1.80e-02). No significant association with response to IFN-beta-1b therapy (p = 0.34) was found.

We sought to characterise biological responses among patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 based on serial, routinely collected, physiological and blood biomarker values. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1335 patients hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (median age 70 years, 56 % male), between 1st March and 30th April 2020. Latent profile analysis was performed on serial physiological and blood biomarkers. Patient characteristics, comorbidities and rates of death and admission to intensive care, were compared between the latent classes. A five class solution provided the best fit. Class 1 \\"Typical response\\" exhibited a moderately elevated and rising C-reactive protein (CRP), stable lymphopaenia, and the lowest rates of 14-day adverse outcomes. Class 2 \\"Rapid hyperinflammatory response\\" comprised older patients, with higher admission white cell and neutrophil counts, which declined over time, accompanied by a very high and rising CRP and platelet count, and exibited the highest mortality risk. Class 3 \\"Progressive inflammatory response\\" was similar to the typical response except for a higher and rising CRP, though similar mortality rate. Class 4 \\"Inflammatory response with kidney injury\\" had prominent lymphopaenia, moderately elevated (and rising) CRP, and severe renal failure. Class 5 \\"Hyperinflammatory response with kidney injury\\" comprised older patients, with a very high and rising CRP, and severe renal failure that attenuated over time. Physiological measures did not substantially vary between classes at baseline or early admission. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our identification of five distinct classes of biomarker profiles provides empirical evidence for heterogeneous biological responses to COVID-19. Early hyperinflammatory responses and kidney injury may signify unique pathophysiology that requires targeted therapy.","output":"Biological responses to COVID-19: Insights from physiological and blood biomarker profiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.2196/23194.].","output":"Correction: COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: A Technologic Tower of Babel and the Gap for International Pandemic Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) is a rare tumor, accounting for about 1% of all pancreatic exocrine cancers.

After progression of disease evaluated based on RECIST 1.1, toripalimab and SOX regimen was administered because of PD-L1-positive expression, high tumor mutation burden (TMB), and somatic FANCA deletion in the tumor. Both the primary and metastatic tumor mass shrank significantly after two courses. The patient exhibited sustained partial response for at least six courses with well-controlled toxic effects. Then the treatment had to be stopped for 2 months because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Computed tomography scan in March 2020 showed disease progression. Time from initiating treatment to tumor progression on toripalimab and SOX regimen treatment took up to at least 8 months.

Here, we develop DA-seq, a powerful unbiased, multi-scale algorithm that uniquely detects and decodes novel DA subpopulations not restricted to well separated clusters or known cell types. We apply DA-seq to several publicly available scRNA-seq datasets on various biological systems to detect differences between distinct phenotype in COVID-19 cases, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy, embryonic development and aging brain, as well as simulated data. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies, but also reveals new DA subpopulations that were not described before.

One hypothesis is that stress signals released by aluminum-exposed necrotic cells play a role in modulating an immune response that contributes to the adjuvants effectiveness. We hypothesized that aluminum adjuvant-induced necrosis would be similar irrespective of cellular origin or composition of the adjuvant. To test this hypothesis, human macrophages derived from peripheral monocytic cell line (THP-1) and cells derived from the human brain (primary astrocytes) were evaluated. Three commercially available formulations of ABAs (Alhydrogel, Imject alum, and Adju-Phos) were examined. Alum was also used as a reference. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species formation, and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified. Cells were exposed to different concentrations (10-100 g/mL) of the adjuvants for 24 h or 72 h. The two FDA approved adjuvants (Alhydrogel and Adju-Phos) decreased cell viability in both cell types. At the 72 h time point, the decrease in viability was accompanied with increased ROS formation. The size of the aluminum agglomerates was not relatable to the changes observed. After exposure to ABAs, astrocytes and macrophages presented a distinct profile of cytokine secretion which may relate to the function and unique characteristics of each cell type. These variations indicate that aluminum adjuvants may have differing capability of activating cells of different origin and thus their utility in specific vaccine design should be carefully assessed for optimum efficacy.","output":"Distinctive Cellular Response to Aluminum Based Adjuvants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electronic healthcare records (EHRs) have become popular because they facilitate sharing of information, and they take small space compared to paper chart systems.

Patients with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome typically present with lower leg pigmented macules, papules and plaques that can coalesce to form larger confluent patches of pigmentation. Recognition of Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome may be difficult or delayed as the cutaneous manifestations may resemble a variety of other dermatological conditions. Most commonly, acroangiodermatitis may be confused with Kaposi's sarcoma and the condition is often referred to as 'Pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma'. Acroangiodermatitis may also resemble or coexist with pigmentation of chronic venous insufficiency. As seen in this report, acroangiodermatitis may also be clinically confused with the 'cavernous' form of a capillary malformation. Here, we describe five patients with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome.

In this study, we investigated whether the control of sedatives, analgesics, and muscle relaxants delivered by this system is non-inferior to that delivered by anesthesiologists. METHODS During anesthesia management by our automated administration control system and by anesthesiologists, the concentration of each drug at the site of effect (calculated from drug administration history) and biometric information (bispectral index, blood pressure, pulse rate, and single contraction ratio %T1) were tabulated during the period from the start to end of surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint was the ratio of adequate anesthesia time, in which all three factors of sedation, analgesia, and muscle relaxation were maintained within the target range, to the period from the start to end of surgery under total intravenous anesthesia. RESULTS Percentage of time under appropriate anesthesia was 73.24  17.24 in the automatic group (n = 28) and 59.94  29.06 in the manual group (n = 28).

Thus, game-based learning environments have caused an increase in the need of game contents, but generation of the game contents and levels is a time-consuming and costly process. Generated game contents and levels should be balanced, dense, aesthetic and reachable. Also, the time as well as the costs spent should be decreased. In order to overcome this problem, automatic and intelligent game content and level generation methods have emerged, and procedural content generation (PCG) is the most popular one of these methods. Artificial intelligence techniques are used for procedural game level generation instead of traditional methods. In this study, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-genetic algorithm (FAHP-GA) methods were used to generate procedural game levels. This proposed hybrid system was used in a developed educational game as a case study to create game levels. The performance of the proposed study was compared to the other multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, and also further statistical analyses were investigated.

IFN- inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2; and TFF2 is a small secreted polypeptide that promotes the repair of mucosal injury and reduces the inflammatory responses. We used the synergistic effect of both proteins to treat COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized, clinical trial involving patients with moderate COVID-19. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either aerosol inhalation treatment with IFN- and TFF2 every 24 h for six consecutive dosages in addition to standard care (experimental group) or standard care alone (control group). The primary endpoint was the time until a viral RNA negative conversion for SARS-CoV-2 in all clinical samples. The secondary clinical endpoint was the time of CT imaging improvement. Data analysis was performed per protocol. This study was registered with chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000030262. FINDINGS: Between March 23 and May 23 of 2020, 86 COVID-19 patients with symptoms of moderate illness were recruited, and 6 patients were excluded due to not matching the inclusion criteria (patients with pneumonia through chest radiography). Among the remaining 80 patients, 40 patients were assigned to experimental group, and the others were assigned to control group to only receive standard care. Efficacy and safety were evaluated for both groups. The time of viral RNA negative conversion in experimental group (Mean, 380 days, 95% CI 207C553), was significantly shorter than that in control group (740 days, 95% CI 457 to 1023) (p = 0.031), and difference between means was 360 days. The percentage of patients in experimental group with reversion to negative viral RNA was significantly increased compared with control group on all sampling days (every day during the 12-day observation period) (p = 0037). For the secondary endpoint, the experimental group had a significantly shorter time until improvement was seen by CT (Mean 621 days, N = 38/40, 95% CI 511C731) than that in control group (876 days, N = 34/40, 95% CI 757C996) (p = 0.002), and difference between means was 255 days. No discomfort or complications during aerosol inhalation were reported to the nurses by any experimental patients. INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, we found that aerosol inhalation of IFN- plus TFF2 in combination with standard care is safe and superior to standard care alone in shortening the time up to viral RNA negative conversion in all clinical samples. In addition, the patients in experimental group had a significantly shortened CT imaging improvement time than those in control group. This study suggested that this combination treatment is able to facilitate clinical improvement (negative for virus, improvement by CT, reduced hospitalization stay) and thereby result in an early release from the hospital. These data support the need for exploration with a large-scale trial of IFN- plus TFF2 to treat COVID-19.

Using three well-established models of cervical cancer natural history adapted to simulate screening across four countries, we compared the impact of a range of standardised screening disruption scenarios in four countries that vary in their cervical cancer prevention programs. All scenarios assumed a 6- or 12-month disruption followed by a rapid catch-up of missed screens. Cervical screening disruptions could increase cervical cancer cases by up to 5-6%. In all settings, more than 60% of the excess cancer burden due to disruptions are likely to have occurred in women aged less than 50a?years in 2020, including settings where women in their 30s have previously been offered HPV vaccination. Approximately 15-30% of cancers predicted to result from disruptions could be prevented by maintaining colposcopy and precancer treatment services during any disruption period. Disruptions to primary screening had greater adverse effects in situations where women due to attend for screening in 2020 had cytology (vs. HPV) as their previous primary test. Rapid catch-up would dramatically increase demand for HPV tests in 2021, which it may not be feasible to meet because of competing demands on the testing machines and reagents due to COVID tests. These findings can inform future prioritisation strategies for catch-up that balance potential constraints on resourcing with clinical need.","output":"Impact of disruptions and recovery for established cervical screening programs across a range of high-income country program designs, using COVID-19 as an example: A modelled analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viral infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host.

These results demonstrate the extreme functional flexibility of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.

One account for this delayed advantage of complex span over simple span, or the McCabe effect (McCabe, Journal of Memory and Language, 58[2], 480C494, 2008), is that complex span affords covert retrieval opportunities that facilitate later retrieval from EM by cumulatively reactivating each successively presented item after distraction. This explanation focuses on the processing that occurs during presentation and maintenance of the items, but no work to date has explored whether the differential demands of immediate retrieval between simple and complex span may explain the effect. Accordingly, these experiments examined the impact of immediate retrieval demands on the McCabe effect by comparing typical immediate serial-recall instructions (i.e., recalling the words in their exact order of presentation) to immediate free-recall (Experiments 1C2) and no-recall (Experiments 2 and 3) instructions. The results suggested that the nature of retrieval may constrain the McCabe effect in some situations (Experiments 1C2), but its demands do not drive the McCabe effect given that it was observed in both serial-recall and no-recall conditions (Experiment 3). Instead, activities such as covert retrieval during the processing phase may underlie the McCabe effect, thus further evidencing the importance of processing in WM for the long-term retention of information.

SETTING: Five hospitals within the Yale New Haven Health System between 3/10/2020 and 9/1/2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients who received diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. EXPOSURE: We developed a logistic regression model from readily available electronic health record data to predict SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients who were positive for COVID and those who were negative and never retested. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This model was applied to patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 who were retested within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. We evaluated the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who would subsequently retest negative and those who would subsequently retest positive. RESULTS: We included 31,459 hospitalized adult patients; 2,666 of these patients tested positive for COVID and 3,511 initially tested negative for COVID and were retested. Of the patients who were retested, 61 (1.7%) had a subsequent positive COVID test. The model showed that higher age, vital sign abnormalities, and lower white blood cell count served as strong predictors for COVID positivity in these patients. The model had moderate performance to predict which patients would retest positive with a test set area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.83). Using a cutpoint for our risk prediction model at the 90th percentile for probability, we were able to capture 35/61 (57%) of the patients who would retest positive. This cutpoint amounts to a number-needed-to-retest range between 15 and 77 patients. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We show that a pragmatic model can predict which patients should be retested for COVID.

On the other hand, it has been suggested that the participation of more than one RBD is a possible mechanism to enhance cell entry.

We compared annual all-cause mortality March-September 2015 through 2020 within and across cohorts, and assessed absolute and relative risks for hospitalisation, admission to intensive care and death due to COVID-19 March-September 2020, using Cox regression. RESULTS: During March-September 2020, the absolute all-cause mortality in RA and in other IJDs was higher than 2015-2019, but relative risks versus the general population (around 2 and 1.5) remained similar during 2020 compared with 2015-2019.

O recrutamento, a elegibilidade do doador e a pesquisa e quantificacao dos anticorpos, sao alguns deles. Nao se sabe ate o momento qual a concentracao de anticorpos necessarias no PC, para que possa ser minimamente efetivo. O Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), preconiza que seja realizada pesquisa de anticorpos contra SARS-CoV-2 e sugere utilizacao de doadores que tenham titulo de anticorpos neutralizantes acima de 1/80. A pesquisa de anticorpos neutralizantes e um teste de pouco acesso na praticas clinica.

Objetivo: Realizar a qualificacao de doadores quanto a existencia e intensidade de anticorpo SARS-CoV-2 IgG em doadores de sangue, a fim de fornecer terapeutica potencialmente eficaz de PC para o tratamento da COVID-19. Materiais e metodos: Foram realizados 459 testes de titulacao SARS-CoV-2 IgG em doadores de sangue do grupo H.Hemo. Os doadores testados eram homens ou mulheres nuligestas, que atendiam aos criterios para doacao de sangue, com exame confirmatorio da SARS- CoV-2 e no minimo 30 dias de resolucao dos sinais e sintomas da doenca. As amostras foram coletadas em duas situacoes: coleta somente de exames para pesquisa e qualificacao do doador para posterior doacao de plasma convalescente por aferese, ou coleta de doacao de sangue total e amostras para titulacao do plasma fresco congelado. Resultados: Dos 459 testes realizados, 333 (73%) apresentaram resultados positivos para IgG.

What would ensue has become a largely unprecedented sequence of alarming events since the FDA began reporting public recalls, withdrawals and safety alerts on their website in 2016. Since then, the United States has been significantly impacted by drug recalls affecting angiotensin receptor blockers. This report arms clinicians with additional guidance and provides a framework for responding appropriately to future similar incidents and includes an overview of the angiotensin receptor blockers, and their effects and safety profiles. METHODS: This report includes a review of data from all pertinent clinical and scientific sources including information from the FDA's inspection documents and recall website. Additional information is provided on the specific bottles including all lot numbers, expiration dates, etc. RESULTS: The recalls/withdrawals are attributable to the presence of cancer-causing contaminants identified during the manufacturing process from drug manufacturers abroad. The root causes behind the recalls and subsequent shortage appear multifactorial, and stem to a certain extent from the outsourcing of medication manufacturing overseas and lack of quality checks and appropriate oversight.

However, reduced trapezial height has sometimes been reported after LRTI. Longer immobilization and delayed rehabilitation times are also problematic. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients who underwent our modified LRTI procedure. METHODS Retrospective study included 26 thumbs in 24 cases with advanced stages. Our modified Burton's procedure was as follows: (1) trapeziectomy was limited to distal-half, (2) the entire flexor carpi radialis (FCR) was harvested from the forearm, and (3) half-slip of the FCR tendon was stabilized by interference screw in the first metacarpal bone tunnel. RESULTS Pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS), the quick Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand score, tip pinch strength significantly improved postoperatively. The preoperative height of the trapezial space was well-maintained at final follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging at the one-year follow-up showed the existence of FCR tendon ball in 15 cases. Eighteen housewives resumed their daily activities after a mean period of 10 days postoperative, while another 6 patients returned to their original jobs after 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS Our modified LRTI method involves distal-half trapeziectomy and entire FCR interposition. A sewn FCR tendon ball always provide enough volume to fill the trapeziectomy space, which helps to prevent sinking of the metacarpal bone. Our technique produced sufficient ligamentoplasty and allowed early mobilization after surgery.","output":"Partial trapeziectomy for Eaton stage III thumb carpometacarpal arthritis: ligament reconstruction with tendon interposition using the entire flexor carpi radialis and interference screw fixation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information and communication technologies have become key elements for the construction of a digital society model that is indispensable to overcome the socioeconomic challenges posed by the Covid-19 health crisis.

This case study seeks to understand the process of care as described by physicians involved in each of the cases that resulted in MAiD. Methods: During the summer of 2020, semistructured interviews were conducted with physicians involved in each known Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) MAiD case. Transcripts were summarized to illuminate details of the care process for each patient, highlighting barriers to patient-centered care. Results: Each case took place in a different province. One MAiD provision took place in a prison hospital, and two provisions took place after the incarcerated patients were transferred to external community hospitals. Case summaries highlight the physicians' efforts and challenges in assuring patient-centered care. Discussion: Physician experiences illuminate several barriers to care: CSC bureaucratic processes that forced longer wait times than typical for patients in the general public; challenges related to accessing release before MAiD application; knowledge of patient preference for location of death; concerns of voluntariness and confidentiality that are unique to CSC patients; and ethical considerations surrounding the presence of prison guards, police officers, and shackles at the time of assessment or provision. Reporting by the Office of the Correctional Investigator highlights additional challenges in these cases.

Here, we show that recombinant IFITM3 reconstituted into lipid vesicles induces negative membrane curvature and that this effect maps to its small amphipathic helix (AH). We demonstrate that AH: (i) partitions into lipid-disordered domains where IAV fusion occurs, (ii) induces negative membrane curvature, and (iii) increases lipid order and membrane stiffness. Additionally, replacing the IFITM3 AH with AH from an unrelated protein did not compromise its antiviral activity. These effects on membrane properties correlate with the fusion-inhibitory activity, as exogenous addition of AH to insulin-producing cells reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our results thus imply that IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to full fusion by imposing an unfavorable membrane curvature and increasing the order and stiffness of the cytoplasmic leaflet of endosomal membranes.","output":"Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 Blocks Fusion of Diverse Enveloped Viruses by Locally Altering Mechanical Properties of Cell Membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are measures of a person's own views of their health, functioning and quality of life. They are typically assessed using validated, self-completed questionnaires known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs are used in healthcare settings to support care planning, clinical decision-making, patient-practitioner communication and quality improvement. PROMs have a potential role in the delivery of social care where people often have multiple and complex long-term health conditions. However, the use of PROMs in this context is currently unclear. The objective of this scoping review is to explore the evidence relating to the use of PROMs in adult social care. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The electronic databases Medline (Ovid), PsychInfo (Ovid), ASSIA (ProQuest), Social Care Online (SCIE), Web of Science and EMBASE (Ovid) were searched on 29 September 2020 to identify eligible studies and other publically available documents published since 2010. A grey literature search and hand searching of citations and reference lists of the included studies will also be undertaken. No restrictions on study design or language of publication will be applied. Screening and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. Quality appraisal of the included documents will use the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and AACODS (Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, Significance) checklists. A customised data charting table will be used for data extraction, with analysis of qualitative data using the framework method. The review findings will be presented as tables and in a narrative summary.

PTA and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) tests were performed in 15 of 30 patients during the active infection period. For all 30 patients, otoscopic examination plus PTA and TEOAE tests were performed at the end of the first month after their treatment. RESULTS When the PTA results of 30 patients (60 ears) before and after COVID-19 were compared, a significant decrease in hearing level was found only at 1000 Hz (p < .05). There were no significant differences at other frequencies. When the PTA and TEAOE test results of 15 patients (30 ears) that were performed during and after COVID-19 were compared, no significant differences were found.

Temperature and relative humidity could have both positive and negative effects on disease events. During the cold seasons especially in the first quarter, higher minimum temperatures, consistently show higher risks of disease occurrence, because this condition stimulates viral activity, while lower minimum temperatures support virus survival in the other quarters of the year with the highest negative effect in the third quarter. On the other hand, relative humidity negatively affects the outbreak in the first quarter of the year as the humid weather does not support viral circulation, while the highest positive effect was found in the second quarter during which low humidity favors the disease event.","output":"Possible ramifications of climate variability on HPAI-H5N1 outbreak occurrence: Case study from the Menoufia, Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

The participants include 88 older adults with mild cognitive decline (mean age = 81.0 [standard deviation = 6.5] years) who participated in a class designed to help prevent cognitive decline. This class was suspended from early-March to end of May 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and resumed in June 2020. We collected demographic and cognitive function test data (Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale [TDAS]) before and after class suspension and questionnaire data on their lifestyle and thoughts during the suspension. Change in TDAS scores from before and after the suspension was used to divide the participants into decline (2 or more points worsening) and non-decline (all other participants) groups, with 16 (18.2%) and 72 (81.8%) participants in each group, respectively. A logistic regression model showed that the odds ratio (OR) for cognitive decline was lower in participants whose responses were engaged in hobbies (OR = 0.07, p = 0.015), worked on a worksheet about cognitive training provided by the town hall (OR = 0.19, p = 0.026), and had conversations over the phone (OR = 0.28, p = 0.0495). There was a significant improvement in TDAS scores after class was resumed (p < 0.01). A proactive approach to intellectual activities and social ties may be important for the prevention of cognitive decline during periods of restrictions due to COVID-19. We found that cognitive function test scores before class suspension significantly improved after resuming classes. We speculate that continued participation in this class led to positive behavioral changes in daily life during periods of restriction due to COVID-19.","output":"Examination of the cognitive function of Japanese community-dwelling older adults in a class for preventing cognitive decline during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies recently accomplished on the Enteric Nervous System have shown that chronic degenerative diseases affect the Enteric Glial Cells (EGC) and, thus, the development of recognition methods able to identify whether or not the EGC are affected by these type of diseases may be helpful in its diagnoses. In this work, we propose the use of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to evaluate if a given animal EGC image was obtained from a healthy individual or one affect by a chronic degenerative disease. In the proposed approach, we have performed the classification task with handcrafted features and deep learning-based techniques, also known as non-handcrafted features. The handcrafted features were obtained from the textural content of the ECG images using texture descriptors, such as the Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Moreover, the representation learning techniques employed in the approach are based on different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, such as AlexNet and VGG16, with and without transfer learning. The complementarity between the handcrafted and non-handcrafted features was also evaluated with late fusion techniques. The datasets of EGC images used in the experiments, which are also contributions of this paper, are composed of three different chronic degenerative diseases: Cancer, Diabetes Mellitus, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. The experimental results, supported by statistical analysis, show that the proposed approach can distinguish healthy cells from the sick ones with a recognition rate of 89.30% (Rheumatoid Arthritis), 98.45% (Cancer), and 95.13% (Diabetes Mellitus), being achieved by combining classifiers obtained on both feature scenarios.","output":"Automatic chronic degenerative diseases identification using enteric nervous system images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) led healthcare providers, including mental health providers, across the U.S. to swiftly shift to telemedicine. Objectives: This shift gave our Department of Psychiatry a chance to better understand key challenges and opportunities vis--vis virtual mental healthcare. We aimed to obtain provider feedback on the use of telepsychiatry and to learn from the provider perspective about patient experiences with video visits. This information will be used to inform the telemedicine strategy at a systems level within our psychiatry department, our academic health system, as well as the field of telemedicine as a whole. Design and Sample: A 22-item online questionnaire comprising 16 quantitative and six qualitative items was distributed to providers currently using video visits to provide care. Results: A total of 89 mental health providers completed the questionnaire. Outcomes demonstrated that while providers perceive challenges associated with virtual care (e.g., fatigue, technology-related issues, and age-related concerns), they also recognize a number of benefits to themselves and their patients (e.g., convenience and increased access). Overall, provider satisfaction, comfort, and willingness to use telepsychiatry was high. Conclusions: The vast majority of providers adapted quickly to the use of virtual platforms; many endorse advantages that suggest virtual care will continue to be a modality they provide in the future, post-COVID-19. It will be important to continue to evaluate aspects of virtual care that may limit clinical assessments and to optimize use to improve access, convenience, and cost-efficiency of mental healthcare delivery.","output":"Going Virtual During a Pandemic: An Academic Psychiatry Department's Experience with Telepsychiatry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeting myeloid cells, especially microglia, for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), is underappreciated. Here, we screened a library of compounds and identified the topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) as a promising drug candidate for microglial modulation. CPT and its FDA-approved analog topotecan (TPT) inhibited inflammatory responses in microglia and macrophages, and ameliorated neuroinflammation in mice. Transcriptomic analysis of sorted microglia revealed an altered transcriptional phenotype following TPT treatment, with Ikzf1 identified as a potential target. Importantly, TOP1 expression was found elevated in several neuroinflammatory conditions, including human MS brains. To achieve targeted delivery to myeloid cells we designed a nanosystem using DNA origami and loaded TPT into it (TopoGami). TopoGami also significantly suppressed the inflammatory response in microglia and mitigated disease progression in MS-like mice. Our findings suggest that TOP1 inhibition represents a therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammatory diseases, and the proposed nanosystem may foster future research and drug development with a demand to target myeloid cells.","output":"Nanoengineered DNA origami with repurposed TOP1 inhibitors targeting myeloid cells for the mitigation of neuroinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Presacral venous bleeding is an uncommon but potentially life threatening complication of rectal surgery. During the posterior rectal dissection, it is recommended to proceed into the plane between the fascia propria of the rectum and the presacral fascia. Incorrect mobilisation of the rectum outside the Waldeyer's fascia can tear out the lower presacral venous plexus or the sacral basivertebral veins, causing what may prove to be uncontrollable bleeding. METHODS A systematic search of the MEDLINE(?) and Embase? databases was performed to obtain primary data published in the period between 1 January 1960 and 31 July 2013. Each article describing variables such as incidence of presacral venous bleeding, surgical approach, number of cases treated and success rate was included in the analysis. RESULTS A number of creative solutions have been described that attempt to provide good tamponade of the presacral haemorrhage, eliminating the need for second operation. However, few cases are reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS As conventional haemostatic measures often fail to control this type of haemorrhage, several alternative methods to control bleeding definitively have been described.

Mosquito control programs are the first line of defense against mosquitoes-borne pathogens in the state of Florida. The purpose of this study was to examine the capabilities of Florida mosquito programs to implement key mosquito measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : In a self-administered online survey, we examined capabilities of all Florida mosquito control programs during the COVID-19 pandemic (both state-approved mosquito districts (N=63) and open programs (N=27). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize information about the characteristics of responding programs, as well as the implemented mosquito control and surveillance activities. We used bivariate analysis to compare the characteristics of these responding programs and the self-reported mosquito measures. Results: : Of the recruited mosquito control programs, 77 completed the survey (85.6% response rate;77/90). Of these, 57.5% (n=42) were Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) mosquito control programs, 21.9% (n=16) were independent tax district programs, 13.7% (n=10) were municipal mosquito control programs, and only 6.8% (n=5) were either health or emergency department mosquito control programs.

Elevation of liver transaminases in the patients' sera has been described in up to 53% of the COVID-19 positive patients. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of the virus on the liver cells are unclear and only few hypotheses are currently available. Data on COVID-19 in pregnant women are lacking and the management of COVID-19 pregnant women is challenging. An elevation of the transaminases during pregnancies infected by SARS-CoV-2 has never been described before. METHODS: Here we presented the case of a 29 years-old patient at 38 weeks of gestation COVID-19 positive with elevated transaminases. RESULTS: The patient showed a progressive decrease of transaminases after the delivery of the fetus. We provided details about the daily transaminases trend, the therapy used and the maternal/neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that in our case the delivery of the fetus contributed to the normalization of the liver enzymes.

A critical priority for P. knowlesi surveillance and control is understanding whether transmission is entirely zoonotic or is also occurring through human-mosquito-human transmission. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to evaluate existing evidence which refutes or supports the occurrence of sustained human-mosquito-human transmission of P. knowlesi. Possible evidence categories and study types which would support or refute non-zoonotic transmission were identified and ranked. A literature search was conducted on Medline, EMBASE and Web of Science using a broad search strategy to identify any possible published literature. Results were synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) framework, using vote counting to combine the evidence within specific categories. RESULTS: Of an initial 7,299 studies screened, 131 studies were included within this review: 87 studies of P. knowlesi prevalence in humans, 14 studies in non-human primates, 13 studies in mosquitoes, and 29 studies with direct evidence refuting or supporting non-zoonotic transmission. Overall, the evidence showed that human-mosquito-human transmission is biologically possible, but there is limited evidence of widespread occurrence in endemic areas. Specific areas of research were identified that require further attention, notably quantitative analyses of potential transmission dynamics, epidemiological and entomological surveys, and ecological studies into the sylvatic cycle of the disease. CONCLUSION: There are key questions about P. knowlesi that remain within the areas of research that require more attention. These questions have significant implications for malaria elimination and eradication programs.

Moreover, when the traditional retailer makes an online entry, although its offline sales decrease, its total offline and online sales increase; also, although the overall market contracts, total online sales and the online price increase. We consider two scenarios of simultaneous and sequential moves made by the retailers to set their prices. We observe that both the retailers benefit under sequential moves than in the simultaneous move; however, the overall market demand is lower in sequential moves than in the simultaneous move.

As for criterion-related validity, high scores on the GADIS-A positively correlated with scales assessing depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and difficulties in emotion regulation, and negatively correlated with social connectedness and life satisfaction. Using latent profile analysis, four groups of gamers were identified, and problematic gaming was associated with greater mental health problems. The findings indicated that psychological comorbidity (e.g., depression and anxiety) was more prevalent among gamers with higher risk of GD.

Those requiring invasive ventilation had the lowest survival rate (41.9%). After adjustment, age (adjusted OR (adj(OR)) for 5-year increase: 1.37, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.63, p<0.001), hypertension (adj(OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.61, p=0.03), room air O2 saturation <92% at presentation (adj(OR) 3.05, 95% CI 1.28 to 7.28, p=0.01), lymphocytopenia (adj(OR) 3.55, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.85, p=0.03) and in-hospital use of antibiotic therapy (adj(OR) 4.91, 95% CI 1.69 to 14.26, p=0.003) were independently associated with the composite endpoint. CONCLUSION: NIV was used in a significant proportion of patients within our cohort, and more than half of these patients survived without the need for intubation. NIV may represent a viable strategy particularly in case of overcrowded and limited intensive care resources, but prompt identification of failure is mandatory to avoid harm. Further studies are required to better clarify our hypothesis.

Healthcare workers (HCW) were prioritized to receive the vaccine. We aim to investigate the side effects and risk factors for allergic reactions in our institution. METHODS: All HCW vaccinations were recorded in an electronic centralized database. All reactions occurring within a 30-minute observation period post vaccination were recorded. Staff were required to report any vaccine-related medical consult including hospitalization occurring within 14 days after vaccination. Moderate/severe reactions were assessed by a medical team and determined if the reactions were probable allergic reactions with consultation with an Allergist. We extracted data from 8 Jan 2021 to 30 April 2021. RESULTS: 5030 and 159 HCW completed 2 doses and 1 dose of the vaccine respectively. There were 1056 HCWs (20.3%) with self-reported pre-existing allergy. There were 114 (1.1%) reactions occurring without the 30-minute observation period, and 64 (56.1%) were related to first dose of vaccine. The most common side effect experienced was aches or pain on any part of the body (n=46, 40.4%) followed by fatigue and/or giddiness (n=45, 39.5%), palpitations and/or shortness of breath (n=22, 19.3%), systemic rash and/or angioedema (n=12, 10.5%) and nausea and/or vomiting (n=12, 10.5%). A total of 23 HCWs complained of systemic rash and/or angioedema that occurred anytime post vaccination. Fifteen HCWs (0.29% of the cohort) were considered to have probable allergic reaction to the vaccine. None of the reactions were classified as anaphylaxis or severe reactions, but 4 HCWs required short hospitalization stay for observation. HCWs with pre-existing allergy had 2.6 times the risk of having probable vaccine-related allergic reaction than HCWs without pre-existing allergy (RR 2.6, 95% CI 0.9 to 7.3, p=0.068) but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: No anaphylaxis or severe reactions were observed in our institution. Acute side effects in our cohort were in line with published trial reports. We noted a raised relative risk of 2.6 of pre-existing allergy with probable vaccine-related allergic reaction but this was not statistically significant.

In the Roman Catholic tradition, the council of Vatican II has defined worship in reference to the endogenous dimensions of the liturgy, with little awareness of outside factors. This paper examines worship in a Catholic parish, characterized by a dynamic Latino minority within a dominantly traditional Italian American population. The endogenous variables of ethnicity and clergy dominance are not recognized while the exogenous variables of national attendance decline, ineffective institutional faith transmission, religious individualism, consumerism, and secularism are ignored. This is so because the clergy defines its responsibility only in reference to the ritual part of the liturgy, not singing and devotions. More generally, the resistance to change can be explained in terms of an ideology of self-preservation, in the form of clerical professionalization and the privatization of worship. The prevalence of ideology in the whole society today, not just religion, call for a greater awareness of the importance of ideology in cultural studies.","output":"Worship and culture: endogenous and exogenous factors in a local church"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face masks are recommended to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

PATIENTS: Adult patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 between February 15, 2020, and April 12, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Hospital-level use of guideline-based care for ARDS including low-tidal-volume ventilation, plateau pressure less than 30 cm H2O, and prone ventilation for a Pao2/Fio2 ratio less than 100. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1,495 adults with COVID-19 ARDS receiving care across 42 hospitals, 50.4% ever received care consistent with ARDS clinical practice guidelines. After adjusting for patient demographics and severity of illness, hospital characteristics, and pandemic timing, hospital of admission contributed to 14% of the risk-adjusted variation in guideline-based care. A patient treated at a randomly selected hospital with higher use of guideline-based care had a median odds ratio of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.1C3.4) for receipt of guideline-based care compared with a patient receiving treatment at a randomly selected hospital with low use of recommended therapies. Median-adjusted inhospital mortality was 53% (interquartile range, 47C62%), with a nonsignificantly decreased risk of mortality for patients admitted to hospitals in the highest use guideline-based care quartile (49%) compared with the lowest use quartile (60%) (odds ratio, 0.7;95% CI, 0.3C1.9;p = 0.49).

Recovery kinetics of anti-CD20 therapy-mediated cellular and humoral effects in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) are poorly defined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the duration of the anti-CD20 treatment-induced effects on humoral responses to COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included pwMS who had discontinued anti-CD20 therapy for ?12 months and remained without immunomodulation. We retrieved demographics and laboratory parameters including B-cell counts and immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, IgA) levels prior to anti-CD20 commencement (baseline) and longitudinally after anti-CD20 treatment discontinuation from electronic medical records. Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were compared with a population of 11 pwMS with ongoing anti-CD20 medication (control cohort). RESULTS: A total of 24 pwMS had discontinued anti-CD20 therapy for a median of 34 months (range: 16C38 months). Antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines were available in 17 (71%). Most individuals (n = 15, 88%) elicited a measurable antibody response [mean: 774 BAU/ml (SD 1283 BAU/ml)] to SARS-CoV-2 immunization on average 22 months (range: 10C30 months) from the last anti-CD20 infusion, which was higher compared with the population with ongoing anti-CD20 therapy (n = 11, mean: 12.36  SD 11.94 BAU/ml; p < 0.00001). Significantly increased antibody levels compared with the control cohort were found among pwMS who were vaccinated >18 months after treatment discontinuation (19C24 months: n = 2, p = 0.013; 25C36 months: n = 9; p < 0.001). The interindividual kinetics for B-cell reconstitution were heterogeneous and mean B-cell counts approached normal ranges 18 months after treatment discontinuation. There was no correlation of B-cell repopulation and vaccine responses. Mean total IgG, IgM, and IgA levels remained within the reference range. CONCLUSION: Anti-CD20-induced inhibition of humoral responses to COVID-19 vaccines is transient and antibody production was more pronounced >18 months after anti-CD20 treatment discontinuation.

Further data regarding COVID-19 knowledge, individual behaviours, occupational choices, and career planning were collected. Based on the results of the Stanford Acute Stress Response Questionnaire, the students were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups for acute stress disorder. The correlation between acute stress disorder and the impact on career planning was analysed. The high-risk group comprised 143 (12.3%) participants, while 1015 (87.7%) participants were in the low-risk group. Two factors increased the risk of acute stress disorder in the students, including 'I think the pandemic is far away from me' (B: 1.27, 95%CI: 1.60-7.87) and 'Physical contact with confirmed or suspected cases' (B: 2.49, 95%CI: 3.42-42.44).

Methods: Using an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were compared across basic demographics. Findings: Of the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72%), older adults ([]55 years; 78%), Asians (81%), and college and/or graduate degree holders (75%) were more likely to accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10%), while 60% of the same group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) black Americans reported lower influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than nearly all other racial groups.

To address this problem, a variety of chiral bicyclic imidazoles were synthesized as organocatalysts for stereoselective (S)-P-phosphoramidation employing a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of phosphoramidoyl chloridates as the coupling reagent to avoid a waste of the other diastereomer.

In this review, we discuss the role of host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe variations in host factor expression as mechanisms underlying the symptoms and severity of COVID-19. We focus on two host factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss genetic variants associated with COVID-19 severity revealed in selected patients and based on genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Furthermore, we highlight important advances in cell and chromatin biology, such as single-cell RNA and chromatin sequencing and chromosomal conformation assays, as methods that may aid in the discovery of viralChost interactions in COVID-19. Understanding how regulation of host factor genes varies in physiological and pathological states might explain the heterogeneity observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, help identify pathways for therapeutic development, and identify patients most likely to progress to severe COVID-19.","output":"From bedside to bench: regulation of host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendeskripsikan dampak pembelajaran daring selama pandemi COVID-19 terhadap kemampuan kognitif dan afektif anak berusia sekolah dasar.

After the first COVID-19 case recorded in March, the Government of Ghana imposed several restrictions on the life of citizenry to prevent the spread of the infection. However, it is imperative to assess and track the knowledge, misperceptions, attitudes and behaviour of Ghanaian on this public health emergency that is moving fast and not well understood before lives are restored to normalcy. This study investigated the knowledge, misperceptions, attitudes and behaviour of Ghanaians on the COVID-19 pandemic through a rapid online survey system. Methods: : The Cochran sample size determination formula was used to estimate a representative sample of adult Ghanaian residents (n = 420) for the cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire (eQuestionnaire) designed with Google Form was administered to the participants who consented to be part of this study. SMS and popular social media handles were used for the distribution of the eQuestionnaire URL to the participants. The survey commenced on July 5th 2020 through to July 15th,2020. Socio-demographic data of participants were gathered on age, gender, religion and level of education. Data collected were analysed using summary and inferential statistics. Results: : A total of 475 adult Ghanaian participants completed the eQuestionnaire. Some Ghanaians believed that the COVID-19 pandemic is a myth (95% CI 25.6%-48.1%) and it does not have any effect on a Ghanaian (African) because of the hot temperate we experience. Majority of the participants (78.2%) thought that older adults were at high risk of death when disease-ridden with COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of the participants (81.5%) were poise that Ghana can successfully manage the COVID-19 pandemic. About 31.5% of the participants indicated they did not wear facial or nose masks when going out of their homes. The participants (81.9%, 389/475) approved that the government should ease the COVID-19 restrictions for life to return normalcy. Conclusion: Although Ghanaians have appreciable knowledge, positive attitude and appropriate behaviour in response to COVID-19 pandemic, a well-coordinated effort is needed to ensure stringent compliance with healthcare protocols toward the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in Ghana.","output":"Towards the Easing of Restrictions During an Infectious Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Online Survey to Assess the Knowledge, Misperceptions, Attitudes and Behaviour of Ghanaians on the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous work nurses are undertaking at the frontline of healthcare throughout the world currently.

Since the early prediction of disease progression could help to assess the optimal treatment strategies, an integrated knowledge of T-cell and antibody response lays the foundation to develop biomarkers monitoring the COVID-19. Whole-blood-platform tests based on the immune response detection to SARS-CoV2 peptides is a new approach to discriminate COVID-19-patients from uninfected-individuals and to evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates, monitoring the immune response in vaccine trial and supporting the serological diagnostics results. Here, we aimed to identify in the whole-blood-platform the best immunogenic viral antigen and the best immune biomarker to identify COVID-19-patients. METHODS: Whole-blood was overnight-stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools of nucleoprotein-(NP) Membrane-, ORF3a- and Spike-protein. We evaluated: IL-1, IL-1Ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL- 15, IL-17A, eotaxin, FGF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-1, PDGF, RANTES, TNF-, VEGF. By a sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis we identified the most important soluble factors discriminating COVID-19- from NO-COVID-19-individuals. RESULTS: We identified a COVID-19 signature based on six immune factors: IFN-, IP-10 and IL-2 induced by Spike; RANTES and IP-10 induced by NP and IL-2 induced by ORF3a. We demonstrated that the test based on IP-10 induced by Spike had the highest AUC (0.85, p < 0.0001) and that the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19-patients did not affect IP-10 production. Finally, we validated the use of IP-10 as biomarker for SARS-CoV2 infection in two additional COVID-19-patients cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: We set-up a whole-blood assay identifying the best antigen to induce a T-cell response and the best biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection evaluating patients with acute COVID-19 and recovered patients. We focused on IP-10, already described as a potential biomarker for other infectious disease such as tuberculosis and HCV. An additional application of this test is the evaluation of immune response in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials: the IP-10 detection may define the immunogenicity of a Spike-based vaccine, whereas the immune response to the virus may be evaluated detecting other soluble factors induced by other viral-antigens.","output":"Exploratory analysis to identify the best antigen and the best immune biomarkers to study SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel human ScFv H12 against SARS-CoV has been selected from a SARS immune library.

To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an emergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates. Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing of pregnant people. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence. RESULTS: The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included. Pregnant individuals were found to be at a heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more likely to lose their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences. High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced significant struggles. Further resources should be directed towards quality epidemiological studies. The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through infection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic circumstances. The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review. Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine and breastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely. The guidelines for labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty and unnecessary harm. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries. The social and economic impact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked. A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries. This likely reflects an increase in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to epidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and more focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and perinatal health: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing trend in the development of powerful ultrashort pulse lasers has attracted increasing attention for this technology to be applied in large-scale surface engineering and modern microfabrication. However, the emission of undesired X-ray photon radiation was recently reported even for industrially relevant laser irradiation regimes, causing serious health risks for laser operators. In the meantime, more than twenty influencing factors have been identified with substantial effects on X-ray photon emission released by ultrashort pulse laser processes. The presented study on enhanced X-ray emission arising from high pulse repetition frequency ultrashort pulse laser processing provides new insights into the interrelation of the highest-contributing parameters. It is verified by the example of AISI 304 substrates that X-ray photon emission can considerably exceed the legal dose rate limit when ultrashort laser pulses with peak intensities below 1  1013 W/cm2 irradiate at a 0.5 MHz pulse repetition frequency. The peak intensity threshold value for X-ray emissions decreases with larger laser spot sizes and longer pulse durations. Another key finding of this study is that the suction flow conditions in the laser processing area can affect the released X-ray emission dose rate. The presented results support the development of effective X-ray protection strategies for safe and risk-free ultrashort pulse laser operation in industrial and academic research applications.","output":"Enhanced X-ray Emissions Arising from High Pulse Repetition Frequency Ultrashort Pulse Laser Materials Processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continued growth of the worlds population and increased interconnectivity heighten the risk that infectious diseases pose for human health worldwide.

This study compared emergency department (ED) responses to the SARS and COVID-19 epidemics and investigate how policy changes affect infection prevention. Methods: A 2003 questionnaire regarding the responses of EDs to SARS was resent to EDs during the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE), implementation of infection control measures (ICMs), and difficulties in performance were compared. Data collection included hospital level, different PPE types provided and ICMs implemented, timing for using PPE and ICMs, and a difficulty rating scale for ICM implementation. Results: In total, 100 EDs responded to the questionnaire in 2003 was reviewed and compared with 131 EDs in 2020. In COVID-19 epidemic, the use of basic PPEs and ICMs was mostly significantly improved, but the percentage of preparedness in high grade PPEs was still low. Quarantine of fever patients outside of EDs was less performed in small to medium sized hospitals (p=0.008 and 0.004). All of the additional ICMs were significantly less implemented in local hospitals. The timing to use PPE and implement ICMs were simultaneously and significantly performed at early stage. Instituting a fever triage ward and restricting fever patient admission became less necessary. The closure of EDs remained the most difficult to perform in both outbreaks. Conclusion: After the policy reforms, ED responses became earlier and more consistent.

While some individuals accept vaccines, others challenge or refuse to be vaccinated, a phenomena called vaccine hesitancy. Here, trust plays a vital role in vaccination intention. Embitterment not only goes along with the sense of being treated unjust but also innates a distrust in others. Thus, embitterment may influence individuals' vaccination intention against COVID-19. In the present study, we investigate how feelings of being socially excluded and the perceived negative impact of the pandemic are associated with embitterment and in turn, how embitterment is related to individuals' vaccination intention and the tendency to hold COVID-19-related conspiracy beliefs (CCBs). This is in regard of the perceived communication style by the government. METHOD: A convenience sample of 281 individuals completed an online survey developed on Qualtrics. In this cross-sectional, nonexperimental designed study, indirect effects of a moderated serial mediation were analyzed using Jamm (Jamovi, Version 0.9; 2019). RESULTS: Results indicated that embitterment went along with increased feelings of social exclusion ( = 0.45, p < 0.001). Further, individuals high in embitterment generally indicated a higher vaccination intention against COVID-19 ( = 0.15, p < 0.01). However, embittered individuals holding CCBs had a decreased vaccination intention against COVID-19 ( = ?0.71, p < 0.001). Thus, whether or not embittered individuals develop CCBs might be a crucial determinant for their vaccination intention. Noteworthy, the relationship between embitterment and the tendency to hold CCBs was reinforced by the notion of an unsatisfactory style of communication by the government. CONCLUSION: Taken together, results suggest that embitterment not only plays a relevant role in vaccination intention against COVID-19 but also for the susceptibility to engage in conspiracy beliefs.","output":"How Social Exclusion, Embitterment, and Conspiracy Beliefs Mediate Individual's Intention to Vaccination against COVID-19: Results from a Moderated Serial Mediation Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the relationship between events reported in international news via categorical discourses and Bitcoin price.

DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCES Searches in Medline (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and grey literature (Google Scholar) were carried out in June 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies should describe original precision health research; involve human participants, datasets or samples; and collect health-related information. Reviews, editorial articles, conference abstracts or posters, dissertations and articles not published in English were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The following data were extracted in independent duplicate: author details, study objectives, technology developed, study design, health conditions addressed, precision health focus, data collected for personalisation, participant characteristics and sentence defining 'precision health'. Quantitative and qualitative data were summarised narratively in text and presented in tables and graphs. RESULTS After screening 8053 articles, 225 studies were reviewed. Almost half (105/225, 46.7%) of the studies focused on developing an intervention, primarily digital health promotion tools (80/225, 35.6%). Only 28.9% (65/225) of the studies used at least four types of participant data for tailoring, with personalisation usually based on behavioural (108/225, 48%), sociodemographic (100/225, 44.4%) and/or clinical (98/225, 43.6%) information. Participant median age was 48 years old (IQR 28-61), and the top three health conditions addressed were metabolic disorders (35/225, 15.6%), cardiovascular disease (29/225, 12.9%) and cancer (26/225, 11.6%).

More than 57% of the articles (130/225) have authors from only one discipline. CONCLUSIONS Although there is a growing number of precision health studies that test or develop interventions, there is a significant gap in the integration of multiple data types, systematic intervention assessment using randomised controlled trials and reporting of participant gender and ethnicity.

Children are often asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms and have a milder disease course compared to adults. Rectal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in both adults and children, suggesting the fecal-oral route as a potential route of transmission. However, only a few studies have investigated this in neonates. We present a neonate with a mild disease course and prolonged rectal SARS-CoV-2 shedding. CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-day old neonate was admitted to the hospital with tachycardia and a family history of COVID-19. The boy later tested positive for COVID-19. His heart rate normalized overnight without intervention , but a grade 1/6 heart murmur on the left side of the sternum was found. After excluding signs of heart failure, the boy was discharged in a habitual state after three days of admission. During his admission, he was enrolled in a clinical study examining the rectal shedding of SARS-CoV-2. He was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in his pharyngeal swabs for 11 days after initial diagnosis and remained positive in his rectal swabs for 45 days. Thereby, the boy remained positive in his rectal swabs for 29 days after his first negative pharyngeal swab. CONCLUSIONS: The presented case shows that neonates with a mild disease course can shed SARS-CoV-2 in the intestines for 45 days. In the current case, it was not possible to determine if fecal-oral transfer to the family occurred, and more research is needed to establish the potential risk of the fecal-oral transmission route.","output":"Prolonged rectal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in a 22-day-old-neonate: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, one of the most common causes of hospitalization of children in developed countries, has been implicated as a cause of asthma. We aimed to characterize the cytokine profile in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) taken from infants during upper respiratory tract infection to investigate whether RSV induced a unique immune response as compared with other viruses. Additionally, we sought to determine whether this profile was influenced by the infants' atopic status. A prospective birth cohort of babies at high risk of atopy was recruited. Ratios of a T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine, interferon gamma (IFN-) and a T-helper 2 (Th2)-like cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), in NPAs were determined during episodes of respiratory tract infections in the first year. The viral aetiology of the respiratory tract infections was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture and immunofluorescence. Atopic status was ascertained at 1 year of age using skin prick tests. Participants were recruited antenatally and subsequently followed in the community. Sixty babies with one or both parents atopic were enrolled into the study. IFN- : IL-10 ratios in NPAs during upper respiratory tract infections and their correlation with viral aetiology and atopic status were the main outcome measures. The mean IFN- : IL-10 ratio was significantly lower (due to lower IFN-) during RSV infections than during infections with other viruses (P = 0035). The cytokine ratio, however, did not differ between infants with or without wheeze during URTIs (P = 044), or between infants who were atopic or non-atopic (P = 049). This study suggests that RSV is associated with lower IFN- production in young babies, regardless of their atopic status, compared to upper respiratory tract infections where either another virus is detected or where no viral identification is made.","output":"Interferon-gamma levels in nasopharyngeal secretions of infants with respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A kiosk-based survey at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in 2016C2018 allowed us to assess public knowledge of antibiotics and public attitudes toward microbes in museum goers.

These visitors also entered age, gender, and country demographic data that allowed for stratification along these demographic and geographic divisions. Because museum goers are likely to be better informed about these and other science-based topics, the results described here can set a potential upper bound for public knowledge on these topics. Surprisingly, the results of our analysis of museum goers answers about microbes and antibiotics indicate a substantial lack of familiarity with both topics. For example, overall only about 50% of respondents can correctly identify penicillin as an antibiotic and less than 50% of museum visitors view microbes as beneficial.

Ageing is known to be one of the significant determinants for COVID-19 severity. Two main reasons underlie this: immunosenescence and age correlation with main COVID-19 comorbidities such as hypertension or dyslipidaemia. This study has two aims. The first is to obtain cut-off points for laboratory parameters that can help us in clinical decision-making. The second one is to analyse the effect of pandemic lockdown on epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters concerning the severity of the COVID-19. For these purposes, 257 of SARSCoV2 inpatients during pandemic confinement were included in this study. Moreover, 584 case records from a previously analysed series, were compared with the present study data. RESULTS: Concerning the characteristics of lockdown series, mild cases accounted for 14.4, 54.1% were moderate and 31.5%, severe. There were 32.5% of home contagions, 26.3% community transmissions, 22.5% nursing home contagions, and 8.8% corresponding to frontline worker contagions regarding epidemiological features. Age &gt; 60 and male sex are hereby confirmed as severity determinants. Equally, higher severity was significantly associated with higher IL6, CRP, ferritin, LDH, and leukocyte counts, and a lower percentage of lymphocyte, CD4 and CD8 count. Comparing this cohort with a previous 584-cases series, mild cases were less than those analysed in the first moment of the pandemic and dyslipidaemia became more frequent than before. IL-6, CRP and LDH values above 69 pg/mL, 97 mg/L and 328 U/L respectively, as well as a CD4 T-cell count below 535 cells/muL, were the best cut-offs predicting severity since these parameters offered reliable areas under the curve. CONCLUSION: Age and sex together with selected laboratory parameters on admission can help us predict COVID-19 severity and, therefore, make clinical and resource management decisions. Demographic features associated with lockdown might affect the homogeneity of the data and the robustness of the results.","output":"The age again in the eye of the COVID-19 storm: evidence-based decision making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Microbial point-of-care testing (POCT) has potential to revolutionize clinical care. Understanding the prognostic value of microbes identified from the upper respiratory tract (a convenient sampling site) is a necessary first step to understand potential for upper respiratory tract POCTs in assisting antimicrobial treatment decisions for respiratory infections (RTIs). The aim was to investigate the relationship between upper respiratory tract microbial detection and disease prognosis, including effects of antimicrobial use. METHODS: Data sources were the MEDLINE and Embase databases. Study eligibility criteria consisted of quantitative studies reporting microbiological and prognostic data from patients of all age groups presenting with RTI. Patients presenting to healthcare or research settings with RTI participated. Interventions included upper respiratory tract swab. The methods used were systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Searches identified 5156 articles, of which 754 were duplicates and 4258 excluded on title or abstract. A total of 144 full texts were screened; 21 articles were retained. Studies reported data for 15 microbes and 26 prognostic measures (390 potential associations). One hundred and seven (27%) associations were investigated statistically, of which 38 (36%) were significant. Most studies reported only prognostic value of test positive results. Meta-analyses suggested hospitalization duration was longer for patients with respiratory syncytial virus than adenovirus and influenza, but significant heterogeneity was observed between studies. CONCLUSIONS: A quarter of potential prognostic associations have been investigated. Of these, a third were significant, suggesting considerable potential for POCT. Future research should investigate prognostic value of positive and negative tests, and interactions between test results, use of antimicrobials and microbial resistance.","output":"Assessing the potential of upper respiratory tract point-of-care testing: a systematic review of the prognostic significance of upper respiratory tract microbes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health systems that are capable of disease surveillance and action to prevent and manage outbreaks require trustworthy community-embedded public health workers who are empowered to undertake their tasks as professionals Economic theory on incentives and norms of agents tasked with performing activities that society cares about yield direct implications for how to recruit and manage frontline health workers to promote trustworthiness and professionalism This paper provides novel evidence from a survey of public health workers in Bihar, India's poorest state, that supports the insights of economic theory and taken together yields ideas that can immediately be put to work in policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis These ideas address problems of governance and trust that have bedeviled health policymakers Managing the current and preventing future pandemics requires going beyond technical health policies to the political institutions that shape incentives and norms of health workers tasked with implementing those policies","output":"Strengthening public health systems : policy ideas from a governance perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Existing primary care cognitive assessment tools are crude or time-consuming screening instruments which can only detect cognitive impairment when it is well established. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, memory services have adapted to the new environment by moving to remote patient assessments to continue meeting service user demand. However, the remote use of cognitive assessments has been variable while there has been scant evaluation of the outcome of such a change in clinical practice. Emerging research in remote memory clinics has highlighted computerized cognitive tests, such as the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA), as prominent candidates for adoption in clinical practice both during the pandemic and for post-COVID-19 implementation as part of health care innovation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Accelerating Dementia Pathway Technologies (ADePT) study is to develop a real-world evidence basis to support the adoption of ICA as an inexpensive screening tool for the detection of cognitive impairment to improve the efficiency of the dementia care pathway. METHODS: Patients who have been referred to a memory clinic by a general practitioner (GP) are recruited. Participants complete the ICA either at home or in the clinic along with medical history and usability questionnaires. The GP referral and ICA outcome are compared with the specialist diagnosis obtained at the memory clinic. The clinical outcomes as well as National Health Service reference costing data will be used to assess the potential health and economic benefits of the use of the ICA in the dementia diagnosis pathway. RESULTS: The ADePT study was funded in January 2020 by Innovate UK (Project Number 105837). As of September 2021, 86 participants have been recruited in the study, with 23 participants also completing a retest visit. Initially, the study was designed for in-person visits at the memory clinic; however, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was amended to allow remote as well as face-to-face visits. The study was also expanded from a single site to 4 sites in the United Kingdom. We expect results to be published by the second quarter of 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The ADePT study aims to improve the efficiency of the dementia care pathway at its very beginning and supports systems integration at the intersection between primary and secondary care. The introduction of a standardized, self-administered, digital assessment tool for the timely detection of neurodegeneration as part of a decision support system that can signpost accordingly can reduce unnecessary referrals, service backlog, and assessment variability.

Results: The most common coping strategies that the literature studies showed were efficient, in particular social and emotional support, physical activity, physical self-care, emotional and physical distancing from work. Coping mechanisms associated with less burnout were also physical well-being, clinical variety, setting boundaries, transcendental, passion for ones work, realistic expectations, remembering patients and organizational activities. Furthermore, it was helpful to listen to the teams needs and preferences about some types of training.

Adaptive heterologous immune responses have broad implications on infection, autoimmunity, allergy and transplant immunology. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved might ultimately open up possibilities for disease prevention, for example by vaccination. METHODS: A structured literature search was performed using Medline and PubMed to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratory-virus induced adaptive HI. RESULTS: In HI the immune response towards one antigen results in an alteration of the immune response towards a second antigen. We provide an overview of respiratory virus-induced HI, including viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) and influenza virus (IV). We discuss T cell receptor (TCR) and humoral cross-reactivity as mechanisms of HI involving those respiratory viruses. Topics covered include HI between respiratory viruses as well as between respiratory viruses and other pathogens. Newly developed vaccines which have the potential to provide protection against multiple virus strains are also discussed. Furthermore, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as narcolepsy, GuillainCBarr syndrome, type 1 diabetes or myocarditis. Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma. CONCLUSION: Respiratory-virus induced HI may have protective but also detrimental effects on the host. Respiratory viral infections contribute to asthma or autoimmune disease development, but on the other hand, a lack of microbial encounter is associated with an increasing number of allergic as well as autoimmune diseases. Future research might help identify the elements which determine a protective or detrimental outcome in HI-based mechanisms.","output":"Respiratory virus-induced heterologous immunity: Part of the problem or part of the solution?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the worst global pandemic of the past century, COVID-19 has had a disproportionate effect on maintenance dialysis patients and their health care providers. At a virtual roundtable on 12 June 2020, DOPPS investigators from fifteen countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas described and compared the effects of COVID-19 on dialysis care, with recent updates added. Most striking is the huge difference in risk to dialysis patients and staff across the world. Per-population cases and deaths among dialysis patients vary over 100-fold across participating countries, mirroring burden in the general population. International data indicate case fatality ratio remains at 10-30% among dialysis patients, confirming the gravity of infection, and that cases are much more common among in-center than home dialysis patients. This latter finding merits urgent study because in-center patients often have greater community exposure, and in-center transmission may be uncommon under optimal protocols. Greater telemedicine use is a welcome change here to stay, and our community needs to improve emergency planning and protect dialysis staff from the next pandemic.

This study explored dental professionals views and experiences of using SDF for managing carious lesions in children. In addition, it explored what they perceived to be the advantages, disadvantages, barriers and enablers to the use of SDF in practice. METHODS: Fifteen semi-structured face-to-face or over-the-phone interviews were conducted with 14 dental professionals from NHS Tayside and NHS Grampian in Scotland. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded and analysed using a thematic approach. RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 dental professionals interviewed were familiar with, or had some existing knowledge of, SDF. Four had used it to treat patients. The majority of participants thought that the main advantage of SDF was that it required minimal patient cooperation. SDF was also perceived as a simple, pain-free and non-invasive treatment approach that could help acclimatise children to the dental environment. However, SDF-induced black staining of arrested carious lesions was most commonly reported as the main disadvantage and greatest barrier to using it in practice. Participants believed that this discolouration would concern some parents who may fear that the black appearance may instigate bullying at school and that others may judge parents as neglecting their childs oral health. Participants thought that education of clinicians about SDF use and information sheets for parents would enhance the uptake of SDF in dental practice. Participants believed that younger children might not be as bothered by the discolouration as older ones and they anticipated greater acceptance of SDF for posterior primary teeth by both parents and children. CONCLUSION: Dental professionals were aware that SDF can be used for arresting carious lesions. They pointed out that the staining effect of carious lesions is a major disadvantage and had preconceived ideas that this could be a barrier for many parents. Participants considered the application process to be simple and non-invasive and requires a minimum level of child cooperation. Participants appreciated the potential of SDF in paediatric dentistry and suggested actions that could help overcome the barriers they highlighted.","output":"Its really no more difficult than putting on fluoride varnish: a qualitative exploration of dental professionals views of silver diamine fluoride for the management of carious lesions in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been reported in almost all countries globally.

The presentations overall objectives are both to review the most salient examples of mobile health (mHealth) technologies useful in the clinical encounter and to guide participants through how to make informed recommendations surrounding the use of mHealth technology. Methods: Specifically, this presentation explores the use of video games in psychotherapeutic treatment, including case studies to exemplify this practice, as well as the use of varying mHealth technologies (eg, digital phenotyping, electronic diary cards). Programs will review each technologys potential risks and benefits. The presentation will also use a mixed didactic and interactive approach to guide participants through specific treatment decisions regarding incorporation of these technologies into the treatment setting (including through use of an online decision-making tool). Results: Psychiatrists have begun exploring clinical use of novel mHealth technologies.

We have sequenced four regions of the replicase genes corresponding to the 5-terminal sequence, PL(pro), M(pro), and RdRp domains from 20 heterologous IBV strains, and compared them with previously published coronavirus sequences. All the coronavirus 5-termini and PL(pro) domains were divergent, unlike the M(pro) and the RdRp domains that were highly conserved with 28% and 48% conserved residues, respectively. Among IBV strains, the 5 untranslated region including the leader sequence was highly conserved (>94% identical); whereas, the N-terminal coding region and the PL(pro) domains were highly variable ranging from 84.6% to 100%, and 77.6% to 100% identity, respectively. The IBV M(pro) and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% and 92.7% conserved residues, respectively. The BJ strain was the most different from other IBVs in all four regions of the replicase.

The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs recovered from infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses irrespective of serotype, suggesting that either there has been an exchange of genetic material among vaccine and field isolates or that there is a convergent evolution to a specific replicase genotype. There was no correlation between the genotype of any region of the replicase gene and pathotype, suggesting that the replicase is not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity.","output":"Comparison of four regions in the replicase gene of heterologous infectious bronchitis virus strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motorcycle taxi drivers are categorized as self-employed and informal workers.

Aside from the detection of viral genome with specific RT-PCR, there is a growing need for reliable determination of the serological status. We aimed at evaluating five SARS-CoV-2 serology assays. METHODS: An in-house immunofluorescence assay (IFA), two ELISA kits (EUROIMMUN(?) ELISA SARS-CoV-2 IgG and NovaLisa(?) SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM) and two lateral flow assays (T-Tek(?) SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Antibody Test Kit and Sure Bio-tech(?) SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Antibody Rapid Test) were compared on 40 serums from RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 10 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative subjects as controls. RESULTS: Control subjects tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with all five systems. Estimated sensitivities varied from 35.5 to 71.0% for IgG detection and from 19.4 to 64.5% for IgM detection. For IgG, in-house IFA, EuroImmun, T-Tek and NovaLisa displayed 50C72.5% agreement with other systems except IFA vs EuroImmun and T-Tek vs NovaLisa. Intermethod agreement for IgM determination was between 30 and 72.5%. DISCUSSION: The overall intermethod agreement was moderate. This inconsistency could be explained by the diversity of assay methods, antigens used and immunoglobulin isotype tested. Estimated sensitivities were low, highlighting the limited value of antibody detection in CoVID-19.

We conducted a qualitative analysis of the media reports published within the first month of the nationwide lockdown with the objectives (a) using the media reports as indications of possible public health impact and population response of a sudden alcohol prohibition in India, (b) suggesting areas for future research. METHODS: : We performed thematic and content analysis of 350 articles published online in national newspapers between the 26th March, 2020 and 25th April, 2020. Initial inductive, followed by deductive coding was done in this exploratory thematic analysis. Results: The thematic analysis revealed four main themes: the beneficial aspects of the policy, the harmful aspects of the policy, non-compliance and attempts to change and / or subvert the policy, popularity and level of public buy-in of the policy. We generated relevant sub-themes under main themes. Two additional themes, not directly related to the sudden prohibition, were use of stigmatizing language and ethical concerns. The content analysis showed the frequency of the appearance of the main themes and proportions of sub-themes and codes under those main themes. CONCLUSION: : The harms, perceived from the media reports, should be balanced against the potential benefits. Absence of a national-level alcohol policy was made apparent by the reflexive, disconnected , and conflictual measures.

In a prospective, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial we investigated 100 pediatric patients with DDH type IIIa, IIIb, and IV (according to Graf classification), who were randomly assigned into the group receiving AS, and the group receiving GA. Baseline demographics, splint duration, and type of DDH were carefully assessed. The presence of AVN was assessed at the follow-up visits at 1 and 7 years after the end of treatment. The AS-group consisted of 50 patients (46 girls) with 76 hips affected (n = 11/Type-IIIa, n = 32/Type-IIIb, and n = 33/Type-IV). The GA-group consisted also of 50 patients (44 girls) with 78 hips involved (n = 15/Type-IIIa, n = 34/Type-IIIb, and n = 29/Type-IV). At 7-years follow-up, AVN was diagnosed in 9 of 154 hips (5.8%), 5 hips in the AS-group and 4 hips in the GA group. The logistic regression model showed no significant difference in AVN incidence between the AS and GA groups at 7-years follow-up (p = 0.27). The multivariate regression analysis showed that neither the type of DDH nor the age at diagnosis influenced the incidence of AVN (p = 0.48 and p = 0.28, respectively). Splint duration was identified as the only significant factor for the long-term incidence of AVN in the treatment of severe DDH. For every month of longer splint duration, the odds of AVN at 7-years follow-up increased by a factor of 3.81 (95%CI: 1.35-13.73, p = 0.02).

Here we report the in vitro activity of AT-511, the free base form of AT-527, against SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs. METHODS: BHK-21, Huh-7, RD and differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (dNHBE) cell cultures were exposed to virus and serial dilutions of test compounds. Independent assessments of antiviral activity were obtained by determining effective concentrations of test compounds required to 1) prevent half-maximal (EC(50)) virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) using MTT or neutral red staining and 2) produce virus yield reductions (VYR) by 90% (EC(90)) using standard endpoint dilution CCID(50) assays in Vero 76 cells. Half maximal cytotoxicity of test compounds was determined by dye (MTT or neutral red) staining in the absence of added virus or by microscopic inspection (dNHBE cells only).

MethodsFrom 11-September-2020 to 05-May-2021, across six sites in the Russian Federation, 496 participants were injected with either placebo or Ad5-nCoV expressing the full-length spike (S) protein from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ResultsSeroconversion (the primary endpoint) rates of 78.5% (95% CI: 73.9; 82.6) against receptor binding domain (RBD), 90.6% (95% CI: 87.2; 93.4) against S protein and 59% (95% CI: 53.3; 64.6) against neutralising SARS-CoV2 antibodies 28 days post-vaccination. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) were also elevated for antibodies against the RBD (405.32 [95% CI: 361.58; 454.46]) and S protein (678.86 [95% CI: 607.44; 754.40]) compared to the GMT of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (16.73 [95% CI: 15.36; 18.22]). Using an IFN-{gamma} ELISpot assay after stimulating the cells with full-length S protein we showed that the Ad5-nCoV vaccine induced the most robust cellular immune response on Days 14 and 28. Up to Day 28, the primary and all secondary endpoints of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine were statistically superior to the placebo ([p] <0.001). Systemic reactions were reported in 113 of 496 (22.8%) participants (Ad5-nCoV, 26.9%; Placebo, 10.5%), and local reactions were reported in 108 (21.8%) participants (Ad5-nCoV, 28.5%; Placebo, 1.6%).

At the end of the pregnancy, the concentration of maternal antibodies is higher in the cord blood, than in the maternal circulation. Simultaneously, the immune system of the fetus begins to work and from the second trimester, fetal IgM is produced by the fetal immune system specific to microorganisms and antigens passing the maternal-fetal barrier. The same time the fetal immune system has to cope and develop tolerance and T(REG) cells to the maternal microchimeric cells, latent virus-carrier maternal cells and microorganisms transported through the maternal-fetal barrier. The maternal phenotypic inheritance may hide risks for the newborn, too. Antibody mediated enhancement results in dengue shock syndrome in the first 8 month of age of the baby. A series of pathologic maternal antibodies may elicit neonatal illnesses upon birth usually recovering during the first months of the life of the offspring. Certain antibodies, however, may impair the fetal or neonatal tissues or organs resulting prolonged recovery or initiating prolonged pathological processes of the children. The importance of maternal anti-idiotypic antibodies are believed to prime the fetal immune system with epitopes of etiologic agents infected the mother during her whole life before pregnancy and delivery.

Methods Participants (N =14,393;Observations =48,486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June, 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). ResultsThe population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score 3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April, 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%), 2020.

This study aims to know the percentage of patients admitted for COVID-19 who required artificial nutrition (AN), their clinical characteristics, as well as the prevalence of DRM and the risk of sarcopenia at hospital discharge and after 6 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, prospective study, with successive inclusion of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 in whom institutional nutritional support (NS) care protocol was applied. Those who received AN underwent a nutritional screening by Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ) and an assessment by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) at hospital discharge, as well as a screening for sarcopenia (SARC-F test) and SNAQ re-test 15 days and 6 months after by a phone call. Symptoms related to food intake, anthropometric and analytical data were also collected. RESULTS: We evaluated 936 patients with a mean age of 63.7  15.3 years; predominantly male (59.7%), overweight 41%, obesity 40.4%; hypertension 52.9%; diabetes mellitus 26.6% and cancer 10.4%. The stay hospital length was 17.3  13.8 days and 13.6% patients died during hospitalization. The modality of nutritional support was: 86.1% dietary adaptation + oral nutritional supplements (ONS); 12.4% enteral nutrition (EN) by nasogastric (NG) tube; 0.9% parenteral nutrition (PN) and 0.6% EN plus PN. Focusing on patients who received AN, follow-up post discharge was possible in 62 out of 87 who survived. Of these, at the time of hospital discharge, 96.7% presented nutritional risk by SNAQ and 100% malnutrition by SGA (20% B; 80% C). During admission, 82.3% presented intense anorexia and the mean weight loss was 10.9  6 Kg (p < 0.001). Fifteen days after being discharged, 12.9% still had anorexia, while hyperphagia appeared in 85.5% of the patients and risk of sarcopenia by SARC-F was present in 87.1% of them. Six months after discharge, 6.8% still had anorexia and 3.4% hyperphagia, with a global weight gain of 4.03  6.2 Kg (p=<0.0001). Risk of malnutrition was present in only 1.7% of the patients, although risk of sarcopenia persisted in 49.2%. CONCLUSION: All patients admitted by COVID-19 for whom EN or PN were indicated following an institutional protocol still presented malnutrition at hospital discharge, and almost all showed risk of sarcopenia, that persisted in almost half of them at 6 months. These findings suggest that nutritional and functional problems persist in these patients after discharge, indicating that they require prolonged nutritional support and monitoring.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on nutritional status during the first wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The aim of this study is to examine the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on quality of life among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in Croatia.

It is made of Polypropylene Random Copolymer (PPR) pipe material and is mounted on a four-wheel bicycle. Several tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the equipment. These were the following: stress analysis, solar energy utilization test, portability assessment, connectivity speed test, and quality assessment. Results suggest that the developed equipment is ready for actual deployment in a remote community in the Philippines. With such deployment, internet connectivity problems can be minimized. As a result, the less fortunate learners can have free and reliable internet access. Moreover, a possible related future work is designing bigger mounting equipment that can carry more accessories due to its portability and mobility aspects.

However, the effectiveness of these test-and-travel strategies to reduce passenger risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission remains unknown. METHODS: In this simulation study, we developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of 100 000 US domestic airline travellers using publicly available data on COVID-19 clinical cases and published natural history parameters to assign individuals one of five health states of susceptible to infection, latent period, early infection, late infection, or recovered. We estimated a per-day risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to a daily incidence of 150 infections per 100 000 people. We assessed five testing strategies: (1) anterior nasal PCR test within 3 days of departure, (2) PCR within 3 days of departure and 5 days after arrival, (3) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection), (4) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR test 5 days after arrival, and (5) PCR test 5 days after arrival. Strategies 2 and 4 included a 5-day quarantine after arrival. The travel period was defined as 3 days before travel to 2 weeks after travel. Under each scenario, individuals who tested positive before travel were not permitted to travel. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period without isolation or quarantine (population-level transmission risk), and the key secondary outcome was the number of infectious people detected on the day of travel (passenger risk of infection). FINDINGS: We estimated that in a cohort of 100 000 airline travellers, in a scenario with no testing or screening, there would be 8357 (95% uncertainty interval 6144C12831) infectious days with 649 (505C950) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test reduced the number of infectious days from 8357 to 5401 (3917C8677), a reduction of 36% (29C41) compared with the base case, and identified 569 (88% [76C92]) of 649 actively infectious travellers on the day of flight; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 2520 days (1849C4158), a reduction of 70% (64C75) compared with the base case. The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days to 5674 (4126C9081), a reduction of 32% (26C38) compared with the base case, and identified 560 (86% [83C89]) actively infectious travellers; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 3124 (2356C495), a reduction of 63% (58C66) compared with the base case. The post-travel PCR alone reduced the number of infectious days to 4851 (3714C7679), a reduction of 42% (35C49) compared with the base case. INTERPRETATION: Routine asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 before travel can be an effective strategy to reduce passenger risk of infection during travel, although abbreviated quarantine with post-travel testing is probably needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when travelling from a high to low incidence setting.

CASE SUMMARY A 58 year-old male presented with acute psychosis and no symptoms associated with COVID-19. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient had a medical history of coronary artery disease, chronic hepatitis C, polysubstance abuse (including cocaine and alcohol), liver disease, anxiety, and panic disorder. Patient was confused, disruptive, unable to communicate, and admitted to hallucinations. Prior to transfer to a psychiatric facility, the patient developed a cough, triggering COVID-19 testing and a positive result. He was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine before this was discontinued. The patient was treated with haloperidol and lorazepam before returning to baseline. He was discharged home with continued isolation. CONCLUSION Acute psychosis, with or without other symptoms, appears to be a potential presentation of COVID-19 and should be considered by clinicians as a possible presenting manifestation. Other coronaviruses appear to have also been linked to neurological manifestations, including psychosis. Neurological manifestations of the virus vary widely, but have been reported multiple times. Treatment, as shown in this case report, appears to be supportive and symptom based for the associated psychotic symptoms. Optimal antiviral treatment is still yet to be clearly defined, as research continues on how to best treat the virus itself.","output":"An Unusual Case of COVID-19 Presenting as Acute Psychosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We empirically investigate the impact of economic uncertainty related to global pandemics on the volatility of the broad commodity price index as well as on the sub-indexes of crude oil and gold.

Approximately 69.05 % (232/336) of the diarrhoeic samples were assessed as bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-positive by RT-PCR assay, and most of the detected strains showed a unique evolution based on 40 spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene fragments. Notably, the 12 complete S genes detected shared 1 identical amino acid mutation (E121V) in the S1 subunit compared with the other 150 complete S genes in the GenBank database. Furthermore, a BCoV strain (designated YAK/HY24/CH/2017) was isolated from one diarrhoeic sample (virus titre : 10(8.17)TCID(50) ml(?1)), and a phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome sequences revealed that strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017 has the closest genetic relationship with the BCoV prototype strain Mebus.

Productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein S and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target; consequently, it has been considered an attractive therapeutic target. To further characterize this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the virus, we set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellulo approaches that allowed us to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association. We report here a computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex, as well as its biochemical and biophysical monitoring using pulldown, AlphaLISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assays. This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches, we developed in cellulo transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and HEK293T-ACE2 cell lines generated in-house. This allowed us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by the S/ACE2 interaction and to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system was set up to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context and a flow cytometry assay was developed to quantify this association at the cell surface. Together, these different approaches are available for both basic and clinical research, aiming to characterize the entry step of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants as well as to investigate the possible chemical modulation of this interaction. All these models will help in identifying new antiviral agents and new chemical tools for dissecting the virus entry step.","output":"In Silico, In Vitro and In Cellulo Models for Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Spike/Human ACE2 Complex, Viral Entry and Cell Fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: According to UNESCO's monitoring, more than 160 countries implemented nationwide closures, which impacted over 87% of the world's student population.

The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. METHOD: The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. RESULTS: By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health - these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest.

Methods: : chart analysis of consecutive patients with confirmed Covid-19 and severe ARF (PaO2/FiO2 ratio <150) who received HFNC. Patients were systematically encouraged to lie in the prone position if tolerated. We calculated initial ROX index (the ratio of SpO2/FIO2 to respiratory rate) while in supine position and at the end of the first HFNC session whether in prone or supine position, and their difference (delta ROX). The success/failure of HFNC (need for intubation) was recorded. Predictors of HFNC failure were identified using ROC curve and logistic regression. Results: : HFNC was administered to 213 out of 360 patients with COVID-19 related severe ARF (71% male, median age:59 years (IQR:50-68), median PaO2/FIO2: 104(73-143). At the start of HFNC, median ROX index was 4(3.4-5). Among included patients, 178 (83.5%) could tolerate prone position and had a median of 4.4(2-6) prone sessions during a median of 10(4-16) hours/day each, for a median of 4(2-7) days. Overall, HFNC failure occurred in 61 patients (28.1%) with similar proportions in patients who had HFNC in prone position and in patients who did not tolerate prone position (29% and 26%, respectively;relative risk:1.14. 95%CI:0.62-2.1). In the prediction of HFNC outcome, AUC was highest for delta ROX (AUC=0.83);AUC for baseline ROX (0.71), PaO2/FiO2 (0.73), and SpO2 (0.67), were significantly lower.

Communication, where signals in the form of parameters of the best GAN in a cell propagate in four directions: North, South, West and East, also plays a role, by communicating adaptations that are both new and fit.

Intratumoral drug accumulation and bio-distribution in major organs were evaluated. Periablational drug penetration was evaluated by pathologic staining and the intratumoral interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) was measured directly. For long-term outcomes, mice bearing 4T1 or H22 tumors were randomized into five groups (n = 8 per group): control (no treatment), RFA alone, LP + RFA (45 C), LP + RFA (70 C) and LP + RFA (45 + 70 C).

To date, there is no specific vaccine against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, nor is there an effective medicine for treating COVID-19, thus raising concerns with respect to the effect of risk factors such as clinical course and pathophysiological parameters on disease severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19. By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity. In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.

However, how its activity is regulated intracellularly is still obscure. In this study, we developed a 3CLpro protease activity reporter system to examine the impact of various factors, including nutrient supplements, ions, pHs, or oxidative stress inducers, on 3CLpro protease activity. We found that oxidative stress could increase the overall activity of 3CLpro. Not altering the expression, oxidative stress decreased the solubility of 3CLpro in the lysis buffer containing 1% Triton-X-100. The Triton-X-100-insoluble 3CLpro was correlated with aggregates formation and responsible for the increased enzymatic activity. The disulfide bonds formed between Cys85 sites of 3CLpro protomers account for the insolubility and the aggregation of 3CLpro. Besides being regulated by oxidative stress, 3CLpro impaired the cellular antioxidant capacity by regulating the cleavage of GPx1 at its N-terminus.

Recently, suture material has been developed characterized by barbs projecting from a monofilament base. Claimed advantages for barbed sutures are a shortened wound closure time and reduced maximum wound tension. It has also been suggested that these sutures would be advantageous microbiologically. The aim of this study was to test the microbiological characteristics of the barbed Quill in comparison to the monofilament Ethilon II and the braided sutures Vicryl and triclosan-coated Vicryl Plus. In our study, sutures were cultivated on color-change agar with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the halo size was measured. In a second study arm with longer cultivation bacterial growth was followed by antibiotic treatment. Ethilon II and Quill showed good comparable results, whereas large halos were found around Vicryl. Vicryl Plus results depended on triclosan sensitivity. After longer bacterial cultivation and antibiotic treatment, halos were up to 3.6 times smaller on Quill than on Vicryl (p < 0.001), but 1.4 times larger than on Ethilon II (p < 0.001) regarding S. aureus. Confocal microscopy analysis showed bacterial colonization between the braided filaments on Vicryl and beneath the barbs on Quill. From a microbiological perspective, barbed sutures can be recommended in aseptic surgery, but should only be used carefully in septic surgery. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Here, two well-preserved specimens of Champsosaurus (CMN 8920 and CMN 8919) are CT scanned to describe their neurosensory structures and infer sensory capability. The anterior portion of the braincase was poorly ossified and thus does not permit visualization of a complete endocast; however, impressions of the olfactory stalks indicate that they were elongate and likely facilitated good olfaction. The posterior portion of the braincase is ossified and morphologically similar to that of other extinct diapsids. The absence of an otic notch and an expansion of the pars inferior of the inner ear suggests Champsosaurus was limited to detecting low frequency sounds. Comparison of the shapes of semicircular canals with lepidosaurs and archosauromorphs demonstrates that the semicircular canals of Champsosaurus are most similar to those of aquatic reptiles, suggesting that Champsosaurus was well adapted for sensing movement in an aquatic environment. This analysis also demonstrates that birds, non-avian archosauromorphs, and lepidosaurs possess significantly different canal morphologies, and represents the first morphometric analysis of semicircular canals across Diapsida.","output":"The internal cranial anatomy of Champsosaurus (Choristodera: Champsosauridae): Implications for neurosensory function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The thermodynamic stability of double-stranded (ds)DNA depends on its sequence. It is influenced by the base pairing and stacking with neighboring bases along DNA molecules. Semiempirical schemes are available that allow us to predict the thermodynamic stability of DNA sequences based on empirically derived nearest-neighbor contributions of base pairs formed in the context of all possible nearest-neighbor base pairs. Current molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allow one to simulate the dynamics of DNA molecules in good agreement with experimentally obtained structures and available data on conformational flexibility. However, the suitability of current force field methods to reproduce dsDNA stability and its sequence dependence has been much less well tested. We have employed alchemical free-energy simulations of whole base pair transversions in dsDNA and in unbound single-stranded partner molecules. Such transversions change the sequence context but not the nucleotide content or base pairing in dsDNA and allow a direct comparison with the empirical nearest-neighbor dsDNA stability model. For the alchemical free-energy changes in the unbound single-stranded (ss)DNA partner molecules, we tested different setups assuming either complete unstacking or unrestrained simulations with partial stacking in the unbound ssDNA. The free-energy simulations predicted nearest-neighbor effects of similar magnitude, as observed experimentally but showed overall limited correlation with experimental data. An inaccurate description of stacking interactions and other possible reasons such as the neglect of electronic polarization effects are discussed.

Gegen Qinlian Pills (GQP) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine that is included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and played an important role in the clinical fight against COVID-19. Although GQP has shown the potential to treat thrombosis, there is no relevant research on its treatment of thrombosis so far. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that GQP may be capable inhibit inflammation-induced thrombosis. STUDY DESIGN: We tested our hypothesis in a carrageenan-induced thrombosis mouse model in vivo and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. METHODS: We used a carrageenan-induced mouse thrombus model to confirm the inhibitory effect of GQP on inflammation-induced thrombus. In vitro, studies in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in silico network pharmacology analyses were performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of GQP and determine the main components, targets, and pathways of GQP, respectively. RESULTS: Oral administration of 227.5 mg/kg, 445 mg/kg and 910 mg/kg of GQP significantly inhibited thrombi in the lung, liver, and tail and augmented tail blood flow of carrageenan-induced mice with reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) and diminished expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in lung tissues. GQP ethanol extract (1, 2, or 5 g/ml) also reduced the adhesion of platelets to LPS stimulated HUVECs. The TNF- and the expression of HMGB1, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B), and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) in LPS stimulated HUVECs were also attenuated. Moreover, we analyzed the components of GQP and inferred the main targets, biological processes, and pathways of GQP in the treatment of inflammation-induced thrombosis through network pharmacology. CONCLUSION: Overall, we demonstrated that GQP could reduce inflammation-induced thrombosis by inhibiting HMGB1/NFB/NLRP3 signaling and provided an accurate explanation for the multi-target, multi-function mechanism of GQP in the treatment of thromboinflammation, and provides a reference for the clinical usage of GQP.","output":"Gegen Qinlian pills alleviate carrageenan-induced thrombosis in mice model by regulating the HMGB1/NF-B/NLRP3 signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the effect of firm-level operating flexibility on stock performance during the COVID-19 outbreak in China.

Baseline operative volume for urologic surgery was calculated using data from the preceding 12 months and compared on a total and by procedure basis. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify hospital-level predictors of change in response to the pandemic. Results: At baseline, we captured 23,788 urologic procedural encounters per month as compared with 19,071 during March 2020- a 19.9% decrease.

We designed a small construct (22.5 kDa, denoted 3A3), consisting of two high-affinity anti-HER3 affibody molecules flanking an albumin-binding domain ABD, which was introduced for prolonged residence in circulation. In vitro, 3A3 efficiently inhibited growth of HER3-expressing BxPC-3 cells. Biodistribution in mice was measured using 3A3 that was site-specifically labelled with 111In via a DOTA chelator. The residence time of 111In-DOTA-3A3 in blood was extended when compared with the monomeric affibody molecule. 111In-DOTA-3A3 accumulated specifically in HER3-expressing BxPC-3 xenografts in mice. However, 111In-DOTA-3A3 cleared more rapidly from blood than a size-matched control construct 111In-DOTA-TAT, most likely due to sequestering of 3A3 by mErbB3, the murine counterpart of HER3. Repeated dosing and increase of injected protein dose decreased uptake of 111In-DOTA-3A3 in mErbB3-expressing tissues. Encouragingly, growth of BxPC-3 xenografts in mice was delayed in an experimental (pilot-scale) therapy study using 3A3.

Authentic cutaneous granulomatous vasculitis (versus vasculitis with extravascular granulomas) can represent a cutaneous manifestation of giant cell arteritis, an eruption secondary to systemic disease such as Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis, or a localized disorder, often a post-herpes zoster (HZ) phenomenon. Lymphocytic vasculitis is a histologic reaction pattern that correlates with broad clinical differential diagnosis, which includes connective tissue disease - mostly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), endothelial infection by Rickettsia and viruses, idiopathic lichenoid dermatoses such as perniosis or ulcerative necrotic Mucha-Habermann disease, and angiocentric cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Skin biopsy extending into the subcutis, identifying the dominant inflammatory cell and caliber of vessels affected, extravascular histologic clues such as presence of lichenoid dermatitis or panniculitis, and correlation with clinical data allows for accurate diagnosis of these uncommon vasculitic entities.","output":"Cutaneous vasculitis update: neutrophilic muscular vessel and eosinophilic, granulomatous, and lymphocytic vasculitis syndromes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When we have a vaccine against COVID-19, who should be vaccinated first?

The acaricidal effect of an experimental UV-C irradiation device was assessed using female adults and eggs of a model organism, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae. METHODS: UV-C light was generated by a pulsed krypton fluoride excimer laser operating at 248-nm emission wavelength. The pulse energy and pulse repetition rate were 5 mJ and up to 100 Hz, respectively. The distance from the light source to the target was 150 mm; the target surface area was 2.16 cm(2). The exposure time for the mites and fresh eggs varied from 1 to 4 min at 5C300 mW, which corresponded to UV doses of 5C80 kJ/m(2). Post-irradiation acaricidal effects (mite mortality) were assessed immediately and also measured at 24 h. The effects of UV-C irradiation on the hatchability of eggs were observed daily for up to 12 days post-irradiation. RESULTS: The mortality of mites at 5 and 40 kJ/m(2) was 26% and 92%, respectively. Mite mortality reached 98% at 80 kJ/m(2). The effect of exposure duration on mortality was minimal. The effect of irradiation on egg hatchability was even more significant than that on adult mite mortality, i.e. about 100% egg mortality at an accumulated dose of as little as 5 kJ/m(2) for each exposure time. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of mite mortality and lethal egg damage were observed after less than 1 min of exposure to 5 mJ UV-C pulsed irradiation at 60 Hz. Pending further developments (such as beam steering, beam shaping and miniaturisation) and feasibility studies (such as testing with mites in real-life situations), the reported results and characteristics of the UV-C generator (modulation of energy output and adaptability to varying spot sizes) open up the use of this technology for a vast field of acaricidal applications that require long-range radiation.

The objective of this study is to gather the main aspects of the clinical research studies undertaken by the Departments of Hospital Pharmacy (DHP) of Spain during the COVID-19 crisis. The decision of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy (SEFH) to sponsor CTs made it possible that 13% of DHP had been led at least one CT. The Spanish Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS), in coordination with Institutional Review Boards, has adopted a fast-track review procedure to accelerate authorizations for CTs related to the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. There have also been numerous public and private calls for financing research projects aimed at contributing to the fight against this virus. Despite the pandemic, actions have been taken to continue ongoing CTs and studies while the safety and well-being of patients are guaranteed. More specifically, the AEMPS and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have issued guidelines that incorporate changes to CT protocols that will have to be applied until the pandemic is over.

In this paper, the authors investigate the role of ride-sharing vehicles in the spread of COVID-19 in metropolitan areas. To this end, the authors considered a compartmental model to capture the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections in an urban population and an agent-based simulation to capture the ride-sharing exposure to the disease. It is shown through the simulation that in the absence of any within-vehicle disease-control measures, ride-sharing can aggravate the spread of disease.

We have developed and present here an initial feasibility and safety study of transanal total mesorectal excision (TME) with splenic flexure release, high ligation of the IMA and IMV, and side-to-end coloanal anastomosis with temporary diverting ileostomy for rectal cancer. METHODS A program of full NOTES TME resection with release of the splenic flexure, high ligation of the IMA/IMV, with side-to-end coloanal anastomosis was performed transanally from December 2013 to July 2014. Demographics, preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were prospectively obtained. Operative components were broken into TME, colonic mobilization, splenic flexure release, IMA/IMV transection, transanal extraction of specimen, and coloanal anastomosis for analysis of performance completion. RESULTS There were 3 women and 1 man on whom we operated. Mean age was 56 (46-65). Mean BMI was 26 (23.8-30.2). The operation was completed entirely transanally in 2 patients. Transanal component completion of the operation was as follows: TME in 3/4; colonic mobilization in 4/4; splenic flexure release in 3/4; IMA/IMV transection in 3/4; transanal specimen extraction in 4/4; coloanal anastomosis in 4/4. Abdominal time for completion of component parts was: splenic flexure release 4:53 (min:s), IMA/IMV 19:43, completion of TME 13:41. Mean EBL was 194 cc (25-500). Aside from stoma site, there were no abdominal incisions. There were no mortalities. Mesorectum was intact in all 4 patients and with negative circumferential and distal margins. CONCLUSION This experience supports the feasibility and safety of a true NOTES TME. The critical anatomic views demonstrated on video affirm the potential of this approach for distal rectal cancer. Colorectal surgery represents the most logical application for NOTES. While highly promising, a great deal of work remains to develop the technique and applicability of NOTES colorectal surgery.","output":"True NOTES TME resection with splenic flexure release, high ligation of IMA, and side-to-end hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurologic manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children is evolving with time.

The HIV prevention cascades have been proposed to replicate the success of the treatment cascades and reinvigorate the prevention programmes through improved monitoring, planning and delivery. We adapted the cascade framework to the PWID context in Ukraine, assessed gaps and analysed factors associated with achieving \\"access\\" and \\"effective use\\" outcomes. METHODS Self-reported data on the use of prevention services and risk behaviours from the 2017 integrated bio-behavioural survey among PWID in Ukraine were used to construct cascades for needle/syringe and condom programmes (NSP and CP). Socio-demographic and behavioural variables were evaluated as potential correlates of cascade outcomes. RESULTS The NSP cascade analysis included 7815 HIV-negative PWID. Motivation to use clean syringes was not assessed and assumed at 100%. Access to clean syringes through NSP in the past 12 months was reported by 2789 participants (35.7%). Effective use of syringes (no sharing in the past 30 days) was reported by 7405 participants (94.8%). NSP access was higher among women, individuals older than 44, and mixed drug users; while effective use was reported more frequently by men and opioid users, with no difference by age. The CP cascade analysis included 6606 (85%) of the HIV-negative PWID who had sex in the past three months. Of those, 2282 (34.5%) received condoms, and 1708 (25.9%) reported consistent use with all partners in the past three months. Older PWID and mixed-drug users accessed condoms more frequently; whereas younger subgroups and opioid users used them more consistently. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the cascade framework was useful to describe the status of HIV prevention among PWID in Ukraine and to identify areas for improvement in the programming and evaluation of HIV prevention. Access to needle/syringe and condom programmes was substantially below the recommended levels. Effective use of clean syringes was reported by a vast majority of PWID, although likely affected by self-report bias; whereas consistent condom use was infrequent. Socio-demographic and behavioural variables showed significant associations in NSP and CP cascade analyses, with little consistency between the access and effective use outcomes.","output":"Operationalizing the HIV prevention cascade for PWID using the integrated bio-behavioural survey data from Ukraine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of reverse genetics revolutionized the study of positive-stranded RNA viruses that were amenable for cloning as cDNAs into high-copy-number plasmids of Escherichia coli. However, some viruses are inherently refractory to cloning in high-copy-number plasmids due to toxicity of viral sequences to E. coli. We report a strategy that is a compromise between infectivity of the RNA transcripts and toxicity to E. coli effected by introducing frameshift mutations into slippery sequences near the viral toxicity sequences in the viral cDNA. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) has cDNA sequences that are toxic to E. coli. The original full-length infectious cDNA of CTV and a derivative replicon, CTV-Cla, cloned into pUC119, resulted in unusually limited E. coli growth. However, upon sequencing of these cDNAs, an additional uridinylate (U) was found in a stretch of Us between nts 3726 and 3731 that resulted in a change to a reading frame with a stop codon at nt 3734. Yet, in vitro produced RNA transcripts from these clones infected protoplasts, and the resulting progeny virus was repaired. Correction of the frameshift mutation in the CTV cDNA constructs resulted in increased infectivity of in vitro produced RNA transcripts, but also caused a substantial increase of toxicity to E. coli, now requiring 3 days to develop visible colonies. Frameshift mutations created in sequences not suspected to facilitate reading frame shifting and silent mutations introduced into oligo(U) regions resulted in complete loss of infectivity, suggesting that the oligo(U) region facilitated the repair of the frameshift mutation. Additional frameshift mutations introduced into other oligo(U) regions also resulted in transcripts with reduced infectivity similarly to the original clones with the +1 insertion. However, only the frameshift mutations introduced into oligo(U) regions that were near and before the toxicity region improved growth and stability in E. coli. These data demonstrate that, when hosts are sufficiently susceptible for infection by transcripts of reduced specific infectivity, introduction of frameshift mutations at slippery sequences near toxic regions of viral cDNAs can be used as an additional strategy to clone recalcitrant viral sequences in high-copy-number plasmids for reverse genetics.","output":"Frameshift mutations in infectious cDNA clones of Citrus tristeza virus: a strategy to minimize the toxicity of viral sequences to Escherichia coli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The choroid plexus (ChP) is an extensively vascularized tissue that protrudes into the brain ventricular system of all vertebrates.

Due to recent reports, vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca) may result in a vaccine-induced catastrophic thrombotic thrombocytopenia disorder. Thus, as of March 16 of 2021, vaccination programs in 18 countries had been suspended until further examination, including Sweden, Germany and France. This disorder presents as extensive thrombosis in atypical sites, primarily in the cerebral venous, alongside thrombocytopenia and the production of autoantibody against platelet-factor 4 (PF4). PF4 autoantibody has the ability to binds the human FcR?3IIA receptor of platelets and contribute to their aggregation. This rare adverse effect extremely resembles the clinical presentation of the classical immune-mediated HIT disorder, which occurs following exposure to heparin. Surprisingly, none of these patients had been pre-exposed to heparin before disease onset, leading to the hypothesis that a viral antigen from the vaccine had triggered the response. Importantly, COVID-19 had been associated with numerous autoimmune manifestations, including the production of pathogenic autoantibodies, new onset of autoimmune diseases and disorders. As the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination leads to the synthesis of specific SARS-CoV-2-proteins, they may trigger a production of PF4 autoantibody though molecular mimicry phenomena, while vaccination compounds lead to a rigorous bystander activation of immune cells. If existing, removing such homological sequences from the vaccine may eliminate this phenomenon. In contrast, it needs to be emphasized that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was found to be safe and efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 in randomized controlled trials, which included 23,848 participants from the UK, Brazil and South Africa.","output":"Perspectives on vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Teamwork and collaboration are central to interprofessional education but fostering these attributes in large undergraduate cohorts is challenging.

RESULTS: Positive participants were more likely to work in the catering/food sector than negative participants before the lockdown. Lockdown restrictions halved the new cases. No significant differences in the likelihood of being SARS-CoV-2 positive for different job categories were detected during lockdown. The presence of respiratory symptoms was an independent predictor for rapid antigen test positivity; however, one-third of newly diagnosed patients were asymptomatic at both time points. CONCLUSIONS: The catering/food sector was the most vulnerable to COVID-19 at the pre-lockdown evaluation. We highlight the crucial role of community-based screening with rapid antigen testing to evaluate the potential modes of community transmission and the impact of infection control strategies.","output":"Repeated Antigen-Based Rapid Diagnostic Testing for Estimating the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Prevalence from the Perspective of the Workers' Vulnerability before and during the Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Everywhere around the globe, the hot topic of discussion today is the ongoing and fast-spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).

Factors associated with antibiotic treatment, outcomes and bacterial infections were analysed.Results: Among the 164 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (median age 60.5 years [IQR] 46-79), twenty-five (15.2%) were admitted to the ICU. Twenty-six (15.9%) died in the hospital. One hundred (61%) received antibiotic treatment. Combination therapies with macrolides were more common in the early part of the study period (26/67, 38.8%). Twenty-eight patients (17.1%) had a confirmed infection, mostly of the urinary tract (18/28, 64.3%). Only 2 (1.2%) had a documented respiratory coinfection. Six of the 7 ICU infections (85.7%) were superinfections. Gram-negative bacteria were most frequently isolated. In multivariate analysis, six factors were associated with antibiotic use: being hospitalized in the ICU (OR: 4.59; 95% CI 1.07-19.71), age > 65 years (OR: 4.16; 95% CI 1.72-10.05), arrival from a nursing home (OR: 4.59; 95% CI 1.11-19.71), diabetes (OR: 4.35; 95% CI 1.26-14.93), bilateral consolidation on chest CT (OR: 9.92; 95% CI 2.40-41.06) and a C-reactive protein level > 60 mg/L (OR:2.46; 95% CI 1.13-5.37).

Because of their substantial social and economic costs, these policies have typically only been implemented when it becomes clear that less stringent measures are insufficient to control virus spread. Nevertheless, the consequences of delaying lockdowns can be even more costly. In this study, we sought to quantify the extent to which delaying implementation of lockdown measures increases total case numbers and ultimately prolongs the length of lockdown required, by considering the first wave of cases across Europe.MethodsData pertaining to COVID-19 cases and containment/closure policies across Europe were obtained from online repositories maintained by Johns Hopkins and Oxford Universities, respectively. We identified key policy dates in each country, including the first date for which any restrictions were recommended or required, the date of lockdown, and the date lockdown was eased. We estimated the parameters governing the growth of COVID-19 during the first wave within each country, using linear splines fit to incident ~ cumulative cases. To allow for standardised comparisons across countries, we considered three distinct periods of growth: initial uncontrolled growth, growth under recommended restrictions, and growth under lockdown. Using stochastic simulations, we then estimated: the natural (i.e. observed) growth of cases, and the counterfactual (i.e. hypothetical) growth of cases that would have been observed in each country had lockdown measures been implemented 1, 3, 5, or 7 days earlier. Under each condition, we estimated the percentage change in total cases, and the percentage reduction in the required length of lockdown.Results39 European countries had both cases and policy data available, of which 33 entered lockdown and had estimable growth parameters. When lockdown was implemented 3 days earlier, total first wave cases were reduced by 16.93% (Q1-Q3: 10.40C19.49) and the median required length of lockdown was reduced by 6.52% (Q1-Q3: 1.92, 10.53). When lockdown was implemented 7 days earlier, total first wave cases were reduced by 31.46% (Q1-Q3: 23.53C37.86) and the median required length of lockdown was reduced by 14.69% (Q1-Q3: 5.48, 24.40).ConclusionDelaying implementation of national lockdown policies is likely to result in substantial case increases that ultimately prolong the length of lockdown required.

The mortality rate, surprisingly, seems to have affected stock and bond prices positively with autocorrelated errors. As for the policy responses, both the containment and fiscal measures had a rather limited impact, whilst there were significant announcement effects which lifted markets, especially in the case of monetary announcements. There is also evidence of a significant, positive response to changes in the effective Federal funds rate, which suggests that the financial industry, mainly benefiting from interest rises, plays a dominant role.","output":"The Impact of Containment Measures and Monetary and Fiscal Responses on US Financial Markets During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electrical and thermal transport controlled by growth mode can be used to optimize thermoelectric properties of ZnO:Al films, which was adjusted by the re-evaporation of Zn and Al via substrate temperatures.

Thus, the carrier mobility and thermal conductivity are tuned by the ratio of equiaxed crystals to columnar crystals. The carrier mobility is dependent on the growth-mode-related defects of oxygen vacancies, zinc interstitials and the substitutional dopant of Al.

In this context, we develop novel algorithms for online network topology inference given streaming observations assumed to be smooth on the sought graph. Unlike existing batch algorithms, our goal is to track the (possibly) time-varying network topology while maintaining the memory and computational costs in check by processing graph signals sequentially-in-time. To recover the graph in an online fashion, we leverage proximal gradient (PG) methods to solve a judicious smoothness-regularized, time-varying optimization problem. Under mild technical conditions, we establish that the online graph learning algorithm converges to within a neighborhood of (i.e., it tracks) the optimal time-varying batch solution.

Despite correlations between outcomes, expertise and advanced cognitive skills, current methods to evaluate these skills remain subjective, rater- and situation-dependent and non-systematic. The purpose of this study was to develop objective metrics using a Web-based platform and to obtain validity evidence for their assessment of decision-making during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS An interactive online learning platform was developed ( www.thinklikeasurgeon.com ). Trainees and surgeons from six institutions completed a 12-item assessment, developed based on a cognitive task analysis. Five items required subjects to draw their answer on the surgical field, and accuracy scores were calculated based on an algorithm derived from experts' responses (\\"visual concordance test\\", VCT). Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and correlation with self-reported experience, Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) score and Objective Performance Rating Scale (OPRS) score were calculated. Questionnaires were administered to evaluate the platform's usability, feasibility and educational value. RESULTS Thirty-nine subjects (17 surgeons, 22 trainees) participated. There was high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95; n = 10) and internal consistency (Cronbach's  = 0.87). The assessment demonstrated significant differences between novices, intermediates and experts in total score (p < 0.01) and VCT score (p < 0.01). There was high correlation between total case number and total score ( = 0.83, p < 0.01) and between total case number and VCT ( = 0.82, p < 0.01), and moderate to high correlations between total score and GOALS ( = 0.66, p = 0.05), VCT and GOALS ( = 0.83, p < 0.01), total score and OPRS ( = 0.67, p = 0.04), and VCT and OPRS ( = 0.78, p = 0.01). Most subjects agreed or strongly agreed that the platform and assessment was easy to use [n = 29 (78 %)], facilitates learning intra-operative decision-making [n = 28 (81 %)], and should be integrated into surgical training [n = 28 (76 %)].

Further, sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 in several European countries show a similar number of cases between the sexes, but more severe outcomes in aged men. Case fatality is highest in men with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear but may offer potential to develop novel risk stratification tools and therapeutic options for women and men. CONTENT: The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China. We discuss potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of disease, such as hormone-regulated expression of genes encoding for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) entry receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as well as sex hormone-driven innate and adaptive immune responses and immunoaging. Finally, we elucidate the impact of gender-specific lifestyle, health behavior, psychological stress, and socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 and discuss sex specific aspects of antiviral therapies. CONCLUSION: The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender.

We have found that substantial demyelination results from the focal inflammatory lesion caused by the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 200 ng) directly into the rat dorsal funiculus. Within 24 h, such injections caused a focal inflammatory response consisting of a substantial number of polymorphonuclear cells and ED1-positive and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-positive macrophages/microglia. The number of inflammatory cells was substantially reduced by day 7. OX-52-positive T-cells were less frequently observed but were present in the meninges at 8 h, reached a maximum in the dorsal funiculus at 7 days, and were rare at 14 days. The inflammation was followed by the appearance of a large lesion of primary demyelination that encompassed up to 75% of the cross-sectional area of the dorsal funiculus. Treatment with dexamethasone significantly reduced the number of cells expressing iNOS, but did not prevent the demyelination. By 28 days the lesions were largely remyelinated, usually by Schwann cells. These changes were not observed in control, saline-injected animals. We conclude that the intraspinal injection of LPS results in inflammation and subsequently in prominent demyelination. The mechanisms underlying the demyelination are not clear, but it is notable that it typically begins with disruption of the adaxonal myelin. Indeed, there is an early loss of myelin-associated glycoprotein within the lesion, despite the persistence of proteolipid protein. This combination is a feature of the pattern III lesion recently described in multiple sclerosis (Lucchinetti et al., 2000), and we therefore suggest that LPS-induced demyelination may serve as the first experimental model available for the study of this type of multiple sclerosis lesion.","output":"Inflammation and primary demyelination induced by the intraspinal injection of lipopolysaccharide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Young people, aged 15-25 years, are at a critical stage of life when they need to navigate vocational pathways and achieve work and study outcomes. Those with mental health problems are particularly at risk of disengagement with work and study and need effective support. The headspace Work and Study (hWS) service is an innovative online platform implemented in Australia to support young people aged 15-25 years with mental health problems to achieve work and study goals. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether the hWS service has been implemented as planned, provides appropriate support for young people, and achieves its main goals. METHODS: Data were collected via 2 methodologies: (1) the hWS Minimum Data Set, which includes data on all clients in the service (n=1139), services delivered, and service impact; and (2) a survey of hWS clients who volunteered to participate in an evaluation of the hWS service (n=137). RESULTS: The service was accessed by its defined target group, young people aged 15-25 years with mental health and work and study difficulties. Young people found the online platform to be acceptable, and the assistance provided and clinical integration useful; many young people achieved positive work and study outcomes, particularly those who engaged more times with the service. More assistance was sought for work than study goals, suggesting that the transition to work may be particularly challenging for young people. One-third (298/881, 33.8%) of the sample for the service impact analyses achieved at least 1 primary work or study outcome, and this increased to 44.5% (225/506) for those who engaged with 5 or more sessions, demonstrating that greater engagement with the service produced better outcomes.

Despite the passage of more than 60 years since its discovery and much evidence representing the contrary, there has been great reluctance to conceive melatonin as anything other than a hormone. Many other body chemicals are known to have multiple roles. Melatonin was first shown to be a hormone derived from the pineal gland, to be actively synthesized there only at night, and to act on targets directly or via the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily. It is of note that over 40 years ago, it was also established that melatonin is present, synthesized locally, and acts within the gastrointestinal tract. A wider distribution was then found, including the retina and multiple body tissues. In addition, melatonin is now known to have non-hormonal actions, acting as a free radical scavenger, an antioxidant, and as modulating immunity, dampening down innate tissue responses to invaders while boosting the production of antibodies against them. These actions make it a potentially excellent weapon against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Early published results support that thesis. Recently, a randomized controlled study reported that low doses of melatonin significantly improved symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, leading to more rapid discharge with no side effects, while significantly decreasing levels of CRP, proinflammatory cytokines, and modulating dysregulated genes governing cellular and humoral immunity. It is now critical that these trials be repeated, with dose-response studies conducted and safety proven. Numerous randomized controlled trials are ongoing, which should complete those objectives while also allowing for a more thorough evaluation of the mechanisms of action and possible applications to other severe diseases.","output":"Melatonin as an Add-On Treatment of COVID-19 Infection: Current Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile health technologies are gaining importance in clinical decision-making.

Therefore, the search for effective drugs with inhibitory and/or virucidal activity is a paramount task. Accessory proteins of the virus play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as they modulate the host's immune response. This paper studied the interaction of one of the SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF10 with macroheterocyclic compounds C protoporphyrin IX d.m.e., Fe(III)protoporphyrin d.m.e. and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3-pyridyl)chlorin tetraiodide, which are potential inhibitors and virucidal agents. The SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 protein shows the highest affinity for Chlorin, which binds hydrophobically to the alpha structured region of the protein. Protoporphyrin is able to form several complexes with ORF10 close in energy, with alpha- and beta-molecular recognition features, while Fe(III)protoporphyrin forms complexes with the orientation of the porphyrin macrocycle parallel to the ORF10 alpha-helix. Taking into account the nature of the interaction with ORF10, it has been suggested that Chlorin may have virucidal activity upon photoexposure. The SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli cells, macroheterocyclic compounds were synthesized, and the structure was confirmed. The interaction between macrocycles with ORF10 was studied by spectral methods. The results of in silico studies were confirmed by experimental data.","output":"Spectral and theoretical study of SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 protein interaction with endogenous and exogenous macroheterocyclic compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 can result in persistent symptoms leaving potential rehabilitation needs unmet. This study aims to describe persistent symptoms and health status of individuals hospitalised for COVID-19 according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health domains of impairments, limitations in activity, and participation restrictions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study consisting in a telephone interview 3 months after hospital discharge. SETTING: This study was conducted during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic by the Local Health Authority of Reggio Emilia (Italy). PARTICIPANTS: Adult individuals discharged from hospital between April and June 2020 after COVID-19. Exclusion criteria: hospitalisation for reasons other than COVID-19, inability to participate in the study, concomitant acute or chronic conditions causing disability. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed: dyspnoea (Medical Research Council), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), mood disturbances (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), limitations in activity (Barthel Index) and participation restrictions (Reintegration to Normal Living Index). We also collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, health status prior to COVID-19, COVID-related clinical manifestations and hospital care pathway up to discharge, rehabilitation interventions, accidental falls and emergency room access. RESULTS: 149 participants (men, 62%; average age 62 (11) years) were enrolled, 35 of which (23%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) while hospitalised. Three months after hospital discharge, nearly half of the participants still suffered from dyspnoea (44%) or fatigue (39%). Almost all individuals (91.2%) recovered a good level of independence in activity of daily living, but 76% still suffered participation restrictions. Female sex was significantly associated with worse outcomes for all symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who had moderate or severe COVID-19 may perceive persistent symptoms which may result in reduced social participation. Sex differences should be monitored, as women may recover more slowly than men.

Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicenter or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR, it extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Without taking this intervention, we predict the number of infections would have been 73 folders higher by the middle of April 2020. Its success requires efficient government initiatives and effective collaborative governance for mobilizing of corporate resources to provide essential goods. This mode may be not suitable to other countries without efficient collaborative governance and sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. This finding has been recently confirmed by other studies that the seroprevalence in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different sub-regions. It highlights that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of herd immunity. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak.","output":"Feasibility study of mitigation and suppression strategies for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies of mental health among hospital personnel during armed conflict are scarce and usually include single time point investigations without a comparison group. The authors compared the psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial functioning of exposed and unexposed hospital personnel at two time points. The research was conducted during 2009 and included a survey of two random samples of hospital personnel (physicians and nurses), one collected during the Gaza War and the other 6 months later. Each sample included hospital personnel who were exposed to war-related stress and others who were not (Study 1: n = 67 and 74 for exposed and unexposed, respectively; Study 2: n = 57 and 50 for exposed and unexposed, respectively). Levels of psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial functioning were measured. Compared to unexposed hospital personnel, exposed hospital personnel had a significantly higher level of postCtraumatic symptoms during the Gaza War and 6 months later. In addition, during the Gaza War, exposed hospital personnel had a significantly higher level of depressive symptoms. However, in the second study, depressive symptoms were similar to those found in the unexposed group. These findings may suggest that war-related stress is associated with postCtraumatic symptoms among hospital personnel even 6 months after exposure.","output":"Psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial functioning among hospital personnel during the Gaza War: A repeated crossCsectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Our objective is to identify the predictive factors and predict hospital length of stay (LOS) in dengue patients, for efficient utilization of hospital resources. Methods: We collected 1360 medical patient records of confirmed dengue infection from 2012 to 2017 at Max group of hospitals in India. We applied two different data mining algorithms, logistic regression (LR) with elastic-net, and random forest to extract predictive factors and predict the LOS. We used an area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity to evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Results: The classifiers performed well, with logistic regression (LR) with elastic-net providing an AUC score of 0.75 and random forest providing a score of 0.72. Out of 1148 patients, 364 (32%) patients had prolonged length of stay (LOS) (> 5 days) and overall hospitalization mean was 4.03  2.44 days (median  IQR). The highest number of dengue cases belonged to the age group of 10-20 years (21.1%) with a male predominance. Moreover, the study showed that blood transfusion, emergency admission, assisted ventilation, low haemoglobin, high total leucocyte count (TLC), low or high haematocrit, and low lymphocytes have a significant correlation with prolonged LOS. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the logistic regression with elastic-net was the best fit with an AUC of 0.75 and there is a significant association between LOS greater than five days and identified patient-specific variables.

Design: Cross-sectional surveys were carried out on the mental health of children; one survey was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and one into the pandemic, 15 months after the implementation of lockdown, social distancing, and school closures. Demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic-related data were collected from specific parent-report and self-report questionnaires. Participants: Participants included children and adolescents between ages 6-16 years, attending a tertiary care hospital without any diagnosed major psychiatric disorder or chronic disorder. Analysis: Data was collected at two points (before the COVID-19 pandemic and during it) and compared. Levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared and tested for statistically significant differences between these two points using appropriate statistical tests. Regression models were constructed to predict the factors affecting increased anxiety levels and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 period. Results: 832 and 1255 children/adolescents were included in the study during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 times, respectively. The median age of the participants was 10 years [Interquartile Range (IQR) = 4 years).

The objectives were to identify critical care drugs required, obtain patient usage data and consider current regional practice to establish the requirement. METHOD: Health and Social Care (HSC) Trusts across Northern Ireland (NI) identified critical care drugs required and an estimation of average daily usage data. The Microsoft Excel database was constructed to compile Trust data and establish regional requirement. The database was refined further according to real-world data from NI HSC Trusts, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre report on COVID-19 in critical care, daily regional COVID-19 figures and other available National data. Components of a tool originally developed for H1N1 and updated for COVID-19 were adapted to reflect the NI context and used in the regional database. The database was clinically reviewed to ensure that it accurately reflected current regional practice given the evolving nature of the pandemic. RESULTS: The critical care drugs required in the pandemic, usage data and current regional practice were identified to establish requirement. A regional database was constructed and used to produce a model for calculating approximate critical drug requirements. The model was used to map critical drug requirements to available stock in Trusts and wholesalers/suppliers, enabling the identification of treatment capacity for these medicines regionally, both currently and for projected surges. Data have also been used in the preparation of weekly regional situation reports provided to both the HSC Board and the Department of Health.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of disinfectants continues to increase and is of fundamental importance in infection control. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of sensitization and the value of patch testing to didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) and the alcohols: ethanol, 1-propanol and isopropanol. METHODS: Clinical patch test data of 145 patients with suspected contact allergy to disinfectants were retrospective analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 145 patients patch tested with the different alcohols, only one nurse was detected with a possible allergy to 1-propanol. Additional patch testing in 84 patients with DDAC 0.05% resulted in five patients with weakly positive reactions only, without clinical relevance. Patch testing with DDAC 0.03% showed no positive reactions at all on day 3 readings. CONCLUSION: DDAC and alcohols are rarely responsible for allergic contact dermatitis.

In addition to corticosteroids, and antiviral drugs like remdesivir, various immunotherapies including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to S protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated to treat COVID-19 patients. These mAbs were initially developed against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2; however, emergence of variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 having mutations in the spike protein in several countries including India raised serious questions on the potential use of these mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, using an in silico approach, we have examined the binding abilities of eight mAbs against several SARS-CoV-2 variants of Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) lineages. The structure of the Fab region of each mAb was designed in silico and subjected to molecular docking against each mutant protein. mAbs were subjected to two levels of selection based on their binding energy, stability, and conformational flexibility. Our data reveal that tixagevimab, regdanvimab, and cilgavimab can efficiently neutralize most of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strains while tixagevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab can form a stable complex with the Delta variants. Based on these data, we have designed, by in silico, a chimeric antibody by conjugating the CDRH3 of regdanivimab with a sotrovimab framework to combat the variants that could potentially escape from the mAb-mediated neutralization. Our finding suggests that though currently available mAbs could be used to treat COVID-19 caused by the variants of SARS-CoV-2, better results could be expected with the chimeric antibodies.","output":"In Silico Analyses on the Comparative Potential of Therapeutic Human Monoclonal Antibodies Against Newly Emerged SARS-CoV-2 Variants Bearing Mutant Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern.

Controlling for the changes in operating hours of stores and local pandemic conditions, we find that the stay-at-home orders resulted in 64.7% decline in consumer traffic on average between March 1st and July 29th. Consumer traffic declined in all the 20 retail categories we study, but the decline was heterogeneous across product categories. Whereas home and office goods were less negatively impacted, apparel, sporting, gift, and department stores suffered the most. Store operating hours declined by 2.5 hours daily between March 2019 to the end of July 2020, on average. Consumers also changed their shopping habits such that, shopping moved to weekdays from weekends and to earlier hours of the day rather than the afternoon and evening hours. These findings suggest that as working-from-home practices become more common place and the pandemic lingers, retailers will need to make significant structural changes to their operations.","output":"The Short Term Impact of COVID-19 on Brick-and-Mortar Retailers: Evidence from Retailtech"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic. The virus that causes various disorders until death is still the focus of world health problems. Various preventive measures have been recommended to stop the spread of COVID-19 in all levels of society, especially families.

This study aims to provide an overview of family empowerment in COVID-19 based on family health tasks using a family-centered nursing approach, as well as to provide information about the benefits of Family Medicinal Plants (TOGA) as alternative prevention of COVID-19 infection. Methods: This research is a type of systematic review that is arranged systematically with the PRISMA-P principle. From the search results, 174 articles were obtained, and 27 articles met the study inclusion criteria. Results: Family management is something that needs to be considered in the COVI D-19 pandemic. Families are expected to know and can carry out various preventive steps together with COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Management in the family can help reduce COVID-19 transmission rates. The family, as the smallest system in the community, is expected to be able to work together in taking various preventative measures, so that it can help shorten the occurrence of a COVID-19 pandemic and remain in optimal health.","output":"Family empowerment in the covid-19 pandemic with the family-centered nursing approach and the utilization of family medicinal plants: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The propagation of COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has become a pandemic which, along with its rapid dissemination worldwide, has brought about an exponential increase in the amount of research related to the subject to which Latin American researchers have contributed actively. Objective: To conduct a descriptive bibliometric study of the main trends in research on COVID-19 produced in Latin America. Materials and methods: We searched in the Web of Science, Scopus, and Pubmed databases to retrieve the Latin American scientific production on COVID-19. Bibliometric indicators of production, visibility, impact, and collaboration were analyzed to assess the regional participation in studies on the subject. Results: The analysis of 142 documents evidenced an exponential growth of scientific production in the period analyzed, an important level of international collaboration (51.4%) in scientific production, and the leadership of regional institutions (71%) in the research with publications in high-visibility jounals especially in Colombia, Brazil, and Mxico. Conclusions: The results regarding the regional participation in the research on COVID-19 were relevant not only in relation to its quantity and exponential growth during the period analyzed but also in terms of its quality and excellence with a high rate of international collaboration and publications in important scientific journals, which besides their visibility, represent a considerable contribution to the research compared to the other geographical contexts.","output":"Bibliometric evaluation of Latin American contributions on COVID-19/ [Anlisis bibliomtrico de la produccin cientfica latinoamericana sobre COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our conscious perception of the world is not an instantaneous, moment-by-moment construction. Rather, our perception of an event is influenced, over time, by information gained after the event; this is known as a postdictive effect. A recent study reported that this postdictive effect could occur even in choice. The present study sought to test whether the striking postdictive effect of choice reflects the modulation of attention on choice, by directly and systematically manipulating attention in two experiments. Specifically, Experiment 1 revealed that the robust postdictive effect of choice was almost completely eliminated when attentional bias was removed. More important, Experiment 2 demonstrated that the postdictive effect of choice could be modulated by directly manipulating participants' attention with a spatial cue, in particular, when the cue appeared at short time delays. These results suggest that choice could be considerably postdictively influenced by attention and this effect was most pronounced within a short time window wherein decision making was most likely in progress. The current study not only enables clarification of the mechanism of the newly discovered postdictive effect of choice, but also extends evidence of the modulation of attention on decision making.","output":"The postdictive effect of choice reflects the modulation of attention on choice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Treating acute respiratory failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is challenging due to the lack of knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. Hypoxemia may be explained in part by the loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The present study assessed the effect of almitrine, a selective pulmonary vasoconstrictor, on arterial oxygenation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN Single-center retrospective observational study. SETTING ICU of Lille Teaching Hospital, France, from February 27, 2020, to April 14, 2020. PATIENTS Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia confirmed by positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 and acute respiratory distress syndrome according to Berlin definition. Data focused on clinicobiological features, ventilator settings, therapeutics, outcomes, and almitrine-related adverse events. INTERVENTIONS Almitrine was considered in patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 ratio < 150 mm Hg) in addition to the recommended therapies, at an hourly IV delivery of 10 g/kg/min. Comparative blood gases were done before starting almitrine trial and immediately after the end of the infusion. A positive response to almitrine was defined by an increase of PaO2/FIO2 ratio greater than or equal to 20% at the end of the infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 169 patients were enrolled. Thirty-two patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome received an almitrine infusion trial. In most cases, almitrine was infused in combination with inhaled nitric oxide (75%). Twenty-one patients (66%) were responders. The median PaO2/FIO2 ratio improvement was 39% (9-93%) and differs significantly between the responders and nonresponders (67% [39-131%] vs 6% [9-16%], respectively; p < 0.0001). The 28-day mortality rates were 47.6% and 63.6% (p = 0.39) for the responders and nonresponders, respectively. Hemodynamic parameters remained similar before and after the trial, not suggesting acute cor pulmonale. CONCLUSIONS Almitrine infusion improved oxygenation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome without adverse effects. In a multistep clinical approach to manage severe hypoxemia in this population, almitrine could be an interesting therapeutic option to counteract the loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and redistribute blood flow away from shunting zones.","output":"Almitrine Infusion in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Single-Center Observational Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have been impacted by and responded to COVID-19 in ways that give us clues about vulnerabilities under climate change, as well as pathways to resilience. Here, we reflect on some of these experiences drawing on case study examples from the Caribbean, Pacific, and Indian Ocean SIDS, exploring how SIDS have responded to COVID-19 and considering the potential for coping mechanisms enacted for the pandemic to support long-term resilience to climate change. Island responses to the pandemic highlight both new directions, like tourist schemes that capitalize on the rise of remote working in Barbados and Mauritius, and reliance on tried and tested coping mechanisms, like bartering in Fiji. Some of the actions undertaken to respond to the pressures of the pandemic, such as visa schemes promoting \\"digital nomadism\\" and efforts to grow domestic food production, have climate resilience and equity dimensions that must be unpacked if their potential to contribute to more sustainable island futures is to be realized.

However, blockchain technology is far from homogeneousnot only with regard to its applications, which now go far beyond cryptocurrencies and have reached businesses and the public sector, but also with regard to its technical characteristics and, in particular, its power consumption. This paper summarizes the status quo of the power consumption of various implementations of blockchain technology, with special emphasis on the recent Bitcoin Halving and so-called zk-rollups. We argue that although Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains do indeed consume a lot of power, alternative blockchain solutions with significantly lower power consumption are already available today, and new promising concepts are being tested that could further reduce in particulary the power consumption of large blockchain networks in the near future. From this we conclude that although the criticism of Bitcoins power consumption is legitimate, it should not be used to derive an energy problem of blockchain technology in general. In many cases in which processes can be digitized or improved with the help of more energy-efficient blockchain variants, one can even expect net energy savings.","output":"Ein Blick auf aktuelle Entwicklungen bei Blockchains und deren Auswirkungen auf den Energieverbrauch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The spike glycoprotein plays a critical role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by recognizing the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mediating fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. It is also the major target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. This review summarizes recent studies on the structure and function of spike glycoprotein, which revealed the structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, similar to those of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, spontaneously samples different prefusion states with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) adopting 'up' or 'down' conformations, and the RBD 'down' to 'up' conformational change is required for ACE2 binding. Receptor binding and spike glycoprotein priming by host proteases such as furin and transmembrane protease serine 2 induce pre to postfusion conformational changes of the spike trimer that enable membrane fusion. Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 were elucidated at atomic resolution using high-resolution crystal structures. These structures, together with adapted and remodeled SARS-CoV-2 strains, further revealed critical residues of the spike glycoprotein for SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission. SUMMARY Recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein provide important structural knowledge for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cross-species transmission.","output":"Structural basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is twenty years since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) defined quality in healthcare, as comprising six domains: person-centredness, timeliness, efficiency, effectiveness, safety and equity. Since then, a new quality movement has emerged, with the development of numerous interventions aimed at improving quality, with a focus on accessibility, safety and effectiveness of care. Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of \\"service-oriented\\" systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or \\"kin-centred care\\" to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. This is a more expansive view of what \\"person-centredness\\" began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient. The new model will provide a construct that may make the attainment of equity in healthcare more possible with a focus on kindness for all.","output":"A multidimensional quality model: an opportunity for patients, their kin, healthcare providers and professionals in the new COVID-19 period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly worldwide with high rates of transmission and substantial mortality. To date, however, no effective treatments or enough vaccines for COVID-19 are available. The roles of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike protein in the treatment of COVID-19 are major areas of research. In this study, we explored the potential of ACE2 and spike protein as targets for the development of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed clinical data, genetic data, and receptor binding capability. Clinical data revealed that COVID-19 patients with comorbidities related to an abnormal renin-angiotensin system exhibited more early symptoms and poorer prognoses. However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 progression is still not clear. Furthermore, if ACE2 is not a good targetable protein, it would not be applicable across a wide range of populations. The spike-S1 receptor-binding domain that interacts with ACE2 showed various amino acid mutations based on sequence analysis. We identified two spike-S1 point mutations (V354F and V470A) by receptor-ligand docking and binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These variants enhanced the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 receptors and were potentially associated with increased infectivity. Importantly, the number of patients infected with the V354F and V470A mutants has increased with the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These results suggest that ACE2 and spike-S1 are likely not ideal targets for the design of peptide drugs to treat COVID-19 in different populations.","output":"Mutations in spike protein and allele variations in ACE2 impact targeted therapy strategies against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mental health of medical students remains to be a matter of concern. Numerous setting-based and individual-based interventions for student mental health have been proposed in the literature. However, the student perspective on those interventions has been largely neglected. This study aims to explore how medical students perceive different interventions and if they desire any additional changes with regard to their studies. Eight focus groups with 71 participants were conducted at a large German medical school. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed and content-analyzed using MAXQDA 18. We found that medical students prefer setting-based interventions. Most proposed interventions were on a setting-based level. For instance, students asked for more information on the universitys psychosocial counseling services and for better information management regarding contact persons. Interventions proposed in the literature received mixed reactions: Several participants did not favour a pass/fail grading system. Students considered a peer-to-peer mentoring program for freshmen very helpful. Students had diverse attitudes towards Balint groups. They approved of several self-management courses, most of them being related to time or stress management. Interestingly, the most urgently wanted interventions appear to be rather easy to implement (e.g. a mentoring program). This study explored the medical student perspective on student mental health interventions. Additionally, our study illustrates the benefit and feasibility of involving students early on in the conception of interventions.

The pharmacokinetics of propofol are however different in children compared to adults. The value of exhaled propofol measurements in pediatric anesthesia has not yet been investigated. Breathing system filters and breathing circuits can also interfere with the measurements. In this study, we investigated correlations between exhaled propofol (exP) concentrations and the Narkotrend Index (NI) as well as calculated propofol plasma concentrations. METHODS: A multi-capillary-column (MCC) combined with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) was used to determine exP. Optimal positioning of breathing system filters (near-patient or patient-distant) and sample line (proximal or distal to filter) were investigated. Measurements were taken during induction (I), maintenance (M) and emergence (E) of children under total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). Correlations between ExP concentrations and NI and predicted plasma propofol concentrations (using pediatric pharmacokinetic models Kataria and Paedfusor) were assessed using Pearson correlation and regression analysis. RESULTS: Near-patient positioning of breathing system filters led to continuously rising exP values when exP was measured proximal to the filters, and lower concentrations when exP was measured distal to the filters. The breathing system filters were therefore subsequently attached between the breathing system tubes and the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the anesthetic machine. ExP concentrations significantly correlated with NI and propofol concentrations predicted by pharmacokinetic models during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. During emergence, exP significantly correlated with predicted propofol concentrations, but not with NI. CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrated that exP correlates with calculated propofol concentrations and NI during induction and maintenance in pediatric patients. However, the correlations are highly variable and there are substantial obstacles: Without patient proximal placement of filters, the breathing circuit tubing must be changed after each patient, and furthermore, during ventilation, a considerable additional loss of heat and moisture can occur. Adhesion of propofol to plastic parts (endotracheal tube, breathing circle) may especially be problematic during emergence.

To perform a systematic review on mortality associated to the use of ACEi in patients with Covid 19 disease. Methods. Search in Medline (PubMed) and in ISI Web of Knowledge; use of other sources. Results. A total of 19 articles were evaluated. Four studies were selected and used to produce the meta-analyses. These four studies involved a total number of 1.423 patients treated with ACEi and 11.868 not treated with ACEi. Significant heterogeneity was seen concerning mortality associated to the use of ACEi in the context of Covid-19 disease. One report showed significantly decreased mortality associated to ACEi use, but this finding was not confirmed by the three other studies. No significant difference in mortality was seen in the meta-analysis (ACEi users versus non-users; random effects; odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.94; P=0.84). When compared to mortality in patients treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, mortality of patients treated with ACEi was not significantly different, although a trend was noted to exist (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 1.34; P=0.32).

Here we present an interesting report on multiple times recurrent COVID-19 infection, probably a case of reactivation and different plausible explanations on the role of thymoma. Conclusion: Acknowledging the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to cause recurrence is very important during the pandemic as a part of the long term transmission mitigation. The case report shows that previous infection does not guarantee complete immunity from COVID-19, especially in immuno-compromised patients. Hence, despite the status of prior infection, vulnerable individuals who recovered from COVID-19 should be under surveillance. ? 2022 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

Sensory symptoms were objectively studied using the following clinical tests after COVID-19 Sniffin Sticks, taste tests, tone/speech audiometry, and video head impulse test. Results: Post-COVID-19-patients were suffering from olfactory and gustatory impairment for up to six months. According to the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, balance disorders were less noticed: Overall, about 40% of the patients during COVID-19 and nearly all patients recovered within six months. After COVID-19, clinical tests revealed that 75% were suffering from hyposomnia/anosmia, and 20% of all patients reported mild hypogeusia for up to six months.

METHODS In 1998, we conducted a multicentre, hospital-based case-control study which enrolled 402 cases of first CNS demyelinating event occurring between 1994 and 1995 and 722 controls matched for centre, age, sex and date of admission. An independent expert committee validated the diagnoses of cases and controls. Data on vaccinations were obtained from a standardized phone interview. Forty percent of eligible cases and 50% of eligible controls could not be localized or were excluded because they did not satisfy inclusion or matching criteria. RESULTS Conditional logistic regression performed on 236 and 355 matched controls showed that adjusted odds ratios for the first CNS demyelinating event within 2 months following an injection of HB vaccine were 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7-4.6] in the whole group and 1.4 (95% CI, 0.4-4.5) in the subgroup of cases (n = 152) and controls (n = 253) referring to vaccination certificates during the phone interview. Restricting the analyses to the cases with definite or probable multiple sclerosis, these odds ratios were 2.0 (95% CI, 0.8-5.4) and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.4-5.6), respectively. Odds ratios tend towards 1 for a longer interval between HB vaccine and demyelinating event. CONCLUSIONS This study was sufficiently powerful to rule out a strong association between HB vaccine exposure and a subsequent demyelinating event. However, it could not provide a clear indication of a moderately increased risk of a CNS demyelinating event shortly after HB vaccination in adults.","output":"Hepatitis B vaccination and first central nervous system demyelinating event: a case-control study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, was first identified in humans in late 2019 and is a coronavirus which is zoonotic in origin.

We collected data from 208 employees who are working from home in India with online questionnaire. Engagement scores have been calculated using UWES-14 (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale). We examined the impact of total 10 variables using multiple regression analysis. Our regression results suggest that proper virtual tools, contact by the organization leaders, mental health checkup and virtual training increases the employee engagement. Female employees are found to be more engaged than male employees while working from home. The number of kids are found to have negative impact on employee engagement. This implies that if the number of kids increases, the virtual employee engagement decreases. Our results could not find any significant impact of virtual teamwork, marital status, and entertainment tools on employee engagement. Based on the research results, this study make few recommendations. First, organizations should facilitate the improvement of virtual tools such as internet speed and personal computer configuration.

Telemedicine shows promise to address these challenges but lacks comprehensive evaluation in the inpatient environment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate an intrahospital telemedicine program (virtual care), along with its impact on exposure risk and communication. METHODS: We conducted a natural experiment of virtual care on patients admitted for COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was documented use of virtual care. Patient characteristics, PPE use rates, and their association with virtual care use were assessed. In parallel, we conducted surveys with patients and clinicians to capture satisfaction with virtual care along the domains of communication, medical treatment, and exposure risk. RESULTS: Of 137 total patients in our primary analysis, 43 patients used virtual care. In total, there were 82 inpatient days of use and 401 inpatient days without use. Hospital utilization and illness severity were similar in patients who opted in versus opted out. Virtual care was associated with a significant reduction in PPE use and physical exam rate. Surveys of 41 patients and clinicians showed high rates of recommendation for further use, and subjective improvements in communication. However, providers and patients expressed limitations in usability, medical assessment, and empathetic communication.

These individuals, often called superspreaders, transmit the virus to an unexpectedly large number of people. Further, a small number of superspreading places (SSPs) where this occurred account for a large number of COVID-19 transmissions. In this study, we propose a spatial network framework for identifying the SSPs that disproportionately spread COVID-19. Using individual-level activity data of the confirmed cases in Hong Kong, we first identify the high-risk places in the first four COVID-19 waves using the space-time kernel density method (STKDE). Then, we identify the SSPs among these high-risk places by constructing spatial networks that integrate the flow intensity of the confirmed cases. We also examine what built-environment and socio-demographic features would make a high-risk place to more likely become an SSP in different waves of COVID-19 by using regression models. The results indicate that some places had very high transmission risk and suffered from repeated COVID-19 outbreaks over the four waves, and some of these high-risk places were SSPs where most (about 80%) of the COVID-19 transmission occurred due to their intense spatial interactions with other places. Further, we find that high-risk places with dense urban renewal buildings and high median monthly household rent-to-income ratio have higher odds of being SSPs. The results also imply that the associations between built-environment and socio-demographic features with the high-risk places and SSPs are dynamic over time.

METHODS: We investigated changes in alcohol consumption among a convenience sample of 1,693 French-speaking Belgian adults using a 3-stage longitudinal online survey. All participants reported their consumption at different stages of lockdown: before lockdown onset (retrospectively, T0), at 2 different times during lockdown (T1 and T2), and after lockdown offset (T3). We also measured socio-demographic variables and the harmfulness of drinking patterns before lockdown. RESULTS: A mixed model with negative binomial distribution indicated that participants decreased their alcohol consumption after lockdown onset and returned to their initial alcohol consumption after lockdown offset. Younger individuals (18C30 years old) were more likely to decrease their consumption during the lockdown period (T1 and T2) than the periods preceding or following lockdown (T0 and T3), especially if they presented hazardous or problematic drinking patterns before lockdown. We only observed a rebound effect after lockdown offset among young moderate drinkers. All participants kept stable their alcohol consumption during lockdown (T1 and T2).

Yet, relatively little is known about attitudes towards covid-19 vaccines in these countries and in Africa in particular. In this paper, we provide cross-country comparable estimates of the willingness to accept a covid-19 vaccine in six Sub-Saharan African countries. MethodsWe use data from six national high-frequency phone surveys from countries representing 38% of the Sub-Saharan African population (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda). Samples are drawn from large, nationally representative sampling frames providing a rich set of demographic and socio-economic characteristics by which we disaggregate our analysis. Using a set of re-calibrated survey weights, our analysis adjusts for the selection biases common in remote surveys. ResultsAcceptance rates in the six Sub-Saharan African countries studied are generally high, with at least four in five people willing to be vaccinated in all but one country. Vaccine acceptance ranges from nearly universal in Ethiopia (97.9%, 97.2% to 98.6%) to below what would likely be required for herd immunity in Mali (64.5%, 61.3% to 67.8%). We find little evidence for systematic differences in vaccine hesitancy by sex or age but some clusters of hesitancy in urban areas, among the better educated, and in richer households. Safety concerns about the vaccine in general and its side effects emerge as the primary reservations toward a covid-19 vaccine across countries. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that limited supply, not inadequate demand, likely presents the key bottleneck to reaching high covid-19 vaccine coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Variables associated with PE abnormalities, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death were investigated through univariate and multivariate analyses and Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS Pancreatic enzymes were available in 254 of 282 COVID-19 patients. Among these, 66 patients (26%) showed mild elevation of PE, and 11 patients (4.3%) had severe elevation (>3 times of the upper limit of normal). Overall, 2 patients met the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Hepatic and renal involvements were associated with PE elevation.

This cross-sectional study included 249 participants (age: 18C91 years; 61.4% female) with chronic conditions and attended the Family Health Strategy program in a small town in Brazil. Data were collected between 2020-07-13 and 2020-07-24 by face-to-face interviews. Self-reported PA, sitting time, chronic diseases, medication use, sociodemographic data, and self-isolation adherence were obtained by questionnaire. During this specific time point of the COVID-19 pandemic, 71.5% of participants did not meet the PA recommendations (500 METs-min/week), and the prevalence of SB risk (4 hours sitting) was 62.7%.

While the mode of COVID-19 infection, its structural configuration, and multiple mechanisms of action including the critical roles of spike proteins have been substantially explored, elucidation of signaling pathways regulating its cellular responses is yet to be fully determined. Among major signaling cascades, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and its downstream pathways have been exploited as the potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19, and its activation induces the release of cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). To that end, the current studies were sought to determine SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit protein (referred to as COVID-19) on PI3K agonist, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-mediated IL-8 release. Given that multiple cell types including epithelial lining of the nasal, bronchial and alveolar cells have been found to be primarily affected by COVID-19, we used nasopharyngeal carcinoma, KBP and non-small cell lung cancer, A549 cell lines for our studies. We observed that treatments with only PMA but not COVID-19 were able to induce dose-dependent IL-8 release from both KBP and A549 cell lines. Our next studies determined the effects of COVID-19 pretreatment with PMA and vice versa to evaluate if any of this combination would exert synergistic effect on IL-8 release. We observed no significant differences in IL-8 release with either of these combinations when compared with PMA-alone group. However, significantly increased IL-8 release was noticed by PMA + COVID-19 combination when compared with COVID-19-alone group. Overall, these studies indicate that PI3K signaling does not directly mediate COVID-19-induced IL-8 release in these cellular models.Copyright ? 2021","output":"205 Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein response on PI3K agonist-mediated IL-8 release"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing antibiotics-independent antibacterial materials is of great importance for combating drug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

However, the effect of MXene size on its properties and bioactivity is still unknown. Herein, we report for the first time that the antibacterial photothermal therapy efficacy of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets is size-dependent. Three MXene suspensions with small size of 196 nm (MX-s), medium size of 347 nm (MX-m) and large size of 497 nm (MX-l) were prepared via ultrasonication. Upon NIR irradiation for 5 min, the temperature of MXene suspensions (10 g/mL) increased to 64, 60 and 56 C for MX-s, MX-m and MX-l, respectively. Accordingly, the viability loss of MRSA induced by MX-s, MX-m and MX-l under NIR was 93%, 69% and 56%, respectively. The in vivo study in the MRSA-infected mouse model showed that the photothermal therapy efficacy of MX-s was comparable to that of the positive control vancomycin.

Indeed, recent academic and newspaper articles have both directly and indirectly asserted that increased DTU is a source of the heightened psychological distress observed during the pandemic.3C5 However, these claims are dubious for two primary reasons. First, these articles rely on self-report measures of DTU, which are inaccurate6 and prone to systematic bias.7 Second, since the pandemic has impacted both mental health and DTU for many, the observed association between the two may be attributable to a shared common cause, rather than causality. Thus, we investigated the longitudinal associations between objectively measured DTU and mental health while accounting for important COVID-19-related effects.MethodsThis study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh and followed Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines. In this four-wave panel study, participants were recruited from Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/), an online participant-recruitment platform. Waves of data collection were launched on August 14, September 12, October 14, and November 9 of 2020. Eligible participants were U.S. residents, 18-35 years old, iPhone users, and had  10 previous submissions on Prolific with approval rating 95%. At each wave, participants uploaded screenshots of their Screen Time application (which passively tracks device usage) and completed self-reports of mental health (depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation [SI]), COVID-19-related stressors, and perceived COVID-19-related impact on well-being and DTU (Table 1). We extracted three elements from the Screen Time screenshots: (1) total screen time, (2) total time spent on social media, and (3) total number of pickups. We estimated separate random-intercept multilevel models for each mental health outcome using Mplus. Predictors were entered hierarchically in blocks (see eTable 3 in Supplement) to assess R2 at the within- and between-person levels. See Supplement for methodological details. ResultsA total of 384 young adults participated in this study (Mage = 24.5, SDage = 5.1;57% female;54% white;48% Bachelors degree education or above). Overall, participants averaged 47.5 hours of Screen Time, 677 pickups, and 15.5 hours of social media over the past week. On average, participants reported experiencing between 4 and 5 pandemic-related stressors per wave. Mean depression and anxiety t-scores were 54.6 and 56.7, respectively, and nearly 29% of participants reported past-week SI at least once. See eTable 1 for summary statistics of sample demographics and primary variables.Results of the multilevel analyses revealed that objectively-measured total screen time and social media use were unrelated to within- or between-person differences in mental health, while between-person difference in pickups was negatively associated with depression (see Figure 1). Together, the objective DTU variables explained, at most, 2.8% of the within- or between-person variance in any of the mental health outcomes (eTable 3 in Supplement). COVID-related impacts on well-being had the largest effects across modelsaccounting for about 45% and 10%, respectively, of the between- and within-person variance in depression and anxiety, and 21%/28% of the between/within variance in SI. DiscussionAmong a sample of young adults, a population with particularly high rates of DTU8 and COVID-19-related distress,1 we found that objectively-measured DTU did not contribute to increases in depression, anxiety, or SIrefuting the popular notion that increases in DTU may be contributing to young peoples ps chological distress during the pandemic. Rather, depression, anxiety, and SI were driven mostly by young peoples reports of the pandemics impact on their well-being. The convenience-based sample, retrospective (past week) assessments of mental health outcomes, and single-item measures of COVID-19-related impacts are limitations of the study. Nevertheless, results indicate that current speculations about the direct harms of DTU on mental health may be unfounded and risk diverting attention from a more likely cause: pandemic-related stressors.","output":"Objectively measured digital technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of chilblain\\\\like lesions (CLL) coincidentally to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic is a topic of great concern.

The aim of this study was to compare MI-associated mortality between COVID-19 lockdown and pre-COVID-19 periods. Methods: We used German claims data from continuously insured adults hospitalized with a MI (ICD-10 I21), and compared 30-days mortality for cases in March-May 2020 (first COVID lockdown in Germany) with March to May in 2017-2019. Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted to test for differences in mortality between pre-COVID and COVID months while controlling for patients age, sex, previous MIs (2-years baseline), and cardiovascular comorbidities. Results: In 2020, we observed 758/612/712 MIs in March/April/May, which was fewer MIs than the average for the same months between 2017-2019 (March: 901;April: 716;May: 853). Over the observational years, there was a shift towards younger patients (average age 2017: 77;2020: 74), and the proportion of women decreased (2017: 42.54%;2020: 39.19%). The length of the index-hospitalization was significantly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2017-2019: 9.19 days;March-May 2020: 8.11 days;p<0.001). Furthermore, the number of deceased patients was lower during the COVID lockdown period (March 2017-2019: 16.53% vs. March 2020: 14.12%;April: 17.19% vs. 16.99%;May: 16.72% vs. 13.48%). However, regression models showed no significant difference between COVID and pre-COVID months except for May (OR [COVID vs. pre-COVID]: 0.73, p=0.014). Conclusions: Even if we cannot rule out the possibility of a higher MI-related mortality during COVID lockdown periods in non-hospitalized MI patients, we cannot confirm the hypothesis that hospitalized patients generally showed a higher mortality due to later admission to hospitals and thus more higher case severity at time of hospital admission.","output":"P64 Evaluating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mortality after Myocardial Infarctions Hospitalization in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of fragility hip fracture care, comparing patients treated before cohorting and in separate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 circuits with the corresponding months in 2018 and 2019.

Dedicated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 circuits were established on March 14th. Patients treated before cohorting (17 patients), in COVID-19 (14 patients) and non-COVID-19 circuits (33 patients) were included. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar for 2018C19 and 2020. Patients in 2020 had a lower median surgical delay (50.5 vs. 91.3 h) and length of stay (9.0 vs. 14.0 days), while those with COVID-19, had longer surgical delays and length of stay (87.7 h and 15.0 days, respectively). Thirty-days mortality was higher among patients before cohorting, but similar in Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 pathways compared to 2018C19 (7.1% and 3.0% vs 5.2%, respectively). 23.5% of patients treated before circuiting suffered coronavirus infectious disease-19 disease after discharge. Following separation, no secondary cases of coronavirus infectious disease-19 were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Separate circuits for patients with and without coronavirus infectious disease-19 provided adequate hip fracture care. We did not observe increased mortality rates among hip fracture patients with preoperatively confirmed or suspected coronavirus infectious disease-19, compared to negative cases and 2018C19.

We hypothesize that populist discourse reduces entrepreneurship by creating regime uncertainty concerning the future stability of the institutional environment, resulting in entrepreneurs anticipating higher future transaction costs. Our model highlights two important factors that moderate the relationship. First, is the strength of political checks and balances, which we hypothesize weakens the negative relationship between populist discourse and entrepreneurship by providing entrepreneurs with greater confidence that the actions of a populist will be constrained. Second, the political ideology of the leader moderates the relationship between populist discourse and entrepreneurship. The anti-capitalistic rhetoric of left-wing populism will create greater regime uncertainty than right-wing populism, which is often accompanied by rhetoric critical of free trade and foreigners but also supportive of business interests. The effect of centrist populism, which is accompanied by a mix of contradictory and often moderate ideas that make it difficult to discern future transaction costs, will have a weaker negative effect on entrepreneurship than either left-wing or right-wing populism. We empirically test our model using a multi-level design and a dataset comprised of more than 780,000 individuals in 33 countries over the period 2002-2016. Our analysis largely supports our theory regarding the moderating role of ideology.

Currently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the most infectious disease worldwide. In the absence of a vaccine or drug, herbal compounds may be used to treat or control this disease. To explore novel potent inhibitors that suppress this virus's growth, we performed molecular docking studies on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using 17 effective herbal compounds, along with three reference drugs. Docking results showed that crategolic acid from Syzygium aromaticum (clove) had the highest binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease, followed by sennoside (A, B, C, and D) compounds from Cassia acutifolia (Sana Makki). Crategolic acid and sennoside (A, B, C, and D) contain amino acid residues and hydrogen bonds involved in the protein-ligand interaction. The present study confirms that crategolic acid and sennoside represent the strongest potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

STUDY DESIGN We designed an online survey using Google Forms and distributed this via a closed social media group with 7031 members, exclusively run for British doctors. No identifiable data were collected and all respondents provided consent for their responses to be used anonymously. The questions covered demographic data followed by exploration of work-life balance and home-life satisfaction across a broad range of domains, including barriers thereto. Thematic analysis was performed for free-text responses. RESULTS 417 doctors completed the survey (response rate: 6%, typical for online surveys). Only 26% reported a satisfactory work-life balance; 70% of all respondents reported their work negatively affected their relationships and 87% reported their work negatively affected their hobbies. A significant proportion of respondents reported delaying major life events due to their working patterns: 52% delaying buying a home, 40% delaying marriage and 64% delaying having children. Female doctors were most likely to enter less-than-full-time working or leave their specialty. Thematic analysis revealed seven key themes from free-text responses: unsocial working, rota issues, training issues, less-than-full-time working, location, leave and childcare. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the barriers to work-life balance and home-life satisfaction among British doctors, including strains on relationships and hobbies, leading to many doctors delaying certain milestones or opting to leave their training position altogether.

Given the precedent for other picornaviruses which use terminal sialic acids (SAs) as receptors, we examined the role of SAs in PSV binding and infection. Using a variety of approaches, including treating cells with a carbohydrate-destroying chemical (NaIO(4)), mono- or oligosaccharides (N-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, and 6-sialyllactose), linkage-specific sialidases (neuraminidase and sialidase S), lectins (Maakia amurensis lectin and Sambucus nigra lectin), proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin), and glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol and phospholipase C), we demonstrated that PSV could recognize 2,3-linked SA on glycolipids as a receptor. On the other hand, PSVs had no binding affinity for synthetic histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), suggesting that PSVs could not use HBGAs as receptors. Depletion of cell surface glycolipids followed by reconstitution studies indicated that GD1a ganglioside, but not other gangliosides, could restore PSV binding and infection, further confirming 2,3-linked SA on GD1a as a PSV receptor. Our results could provide significant information on the understanding of the life cycle of sapelovirus and other picornaviruses. For the broader community in the area of pathogens and pathogenesis, these findings and insights could contribute to the development of affordable, useful, and efficient drugs for anti-sapelovirus therapy. IMPORTANCE The porcine sapelovirus (PSV) is known to cause enteritis, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis, and reproductive disorders in pigs. However, the receptor(s) that the PSV utilizes to enter host cells remains largely unknown. Using a variety of approaches, we showed that 2,3-linked terminal sialic acid (SA) on the cell surface GD1a ganglioside could be used for PSV binding and infection as a receptor. On the other hand, histo-blood group antigens also present in the cell surface carbohydrates could not be utilized as PSV receptors for binding and infection. These findings should contribute to the understanding of the sapelovirus life cycle and to the development of affordable, useful and efficient drugs for anti-sapelovirus therapy.","output":"Porcine Sapelovirus Uses 2,3-Linked Sialic Acid on GD1a Ganglioside as a Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research has several purposes: First to assess the bacterial and fungal minimum inhibitory concentration of Origanum Syriacum essential oil.

After WES data filtering, bioinformatic prediction and co-segregation analysis, a nonsense mutation (NM_003476.5:c.364C>T; NP_003467.1:p.Arg122*) of CSRP3 was identified in this family. This variant was predicted to be disease-causing and resulted in a truncated protein. CONCLUSIONS This is the first HCM family case of CSRP3 (p.Arg122*) variation in Asia. The finding here not only contributes to the genetic diagnosis and counseling of the family, but also provides a new case with detailed phenotypes that may be caused by the CSRP3 variant.","output":"CSRP3, p.Arg122*, is Responsible for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in a Chinese Family."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory infections (RI) significantly burden society, mainly when there are recurrent respiratory infections (RRI). Thus, there is a need to prevent RI in clinical practice. In this regard, the modulation of the immune system and resolution of the inflammatory cascade could represent an ideal way to prevent RI. Stimunex? gocce, a multicomponent food supplement, contains Sambucus nigra extract, ?-glucan, Zinc, and Vitamin D3. This study investigated its ability to prevent RRI in children using a real-world setting: the pediatric primary care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-eight children with RRI were enrolled in the current study. The food supplement was randomly prescribed to 160 children with RRI daily for 4 months (Active group); the remaining 138 children with RRI were treated only with standard therapy for RI (Control group). The number and duration of RI, parental perception of symptom severity and treatment efficacy, use of medications, and school and working absence were evaluated. RESULTS: Children treated with Stimunex? gocce had significantly less RI than the Control group, both concerning upper and lower RI (p??0.001 and 0.003, respectively) during the follow-up period. Moreover, children in the Active group experienced shorter RI duration during the treatment and follow-up phases (p??0.001 for both). In addition, parents of treated children perceived less severe symptoms and better treatment efficacy during the first and follow-up phases (p??0.001 for all). The food supplement was well tolerated and there was no adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: The current real-world study demonstrated that Stimunex? gocce supplementation in children with RRI might safely prevent RI episodes and reduce RI duration. These outcomes should be highlighted as obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic era, characterized by a dramatic reduction of RI.","output":"Primary care experience on Stimunex? gocce in children with recurrent respiratory infections: a real-world study during the COVID-19 pandemic era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as one of the diseases pneumonia was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19 is considered the third most common coronavirus among individuals after acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) in the 20th century. Many studies have shown that cell therapy and regenerative medicine approaches have an impressive effect on different dangerous diseases in a way that using a cell-based experiment could be effective for improving humans with severe acute respiratory infections caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus. Accordingly, due to the stunning effects of mesenchymal stem cells and derivatives on the treatment of various diseases, this review focuses on the auxiliary role of mesenchymal stem cells and their derivatives in reducing the inflammatory processes of acute respiratory infections resulted from the 2019 novel coronavirus. The reported MSCs treatment outcomes are significant because these cells prevent the immune system from over-activating and improve, endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The MSCs can be an effective, autologous, and safe treatment, and therefore, share the results.

Even when interventions produce the desired outcomes in attitudes, it is often challenging to translate those psychological changes into subsequent behaviors. Previous research has shown that elaboration (amount of thinking) is a critical construct for understanding the ability of attitudes to guide behavior. Instead of looking directly at objective elaboration, this study examined attitude-behavior correspondence as a function of subjective elaboration. METHOD Participants were first randomly assigned to generate positive or negative arguments with regard to taxing junk food. After this experimental manipulation, participants reported their subjective elaboration (as an additional predictor), and their attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding the proposal (as dependent measures). RESULTS As hypothesized, the results showed that the greater perceived elaboration, the larger the ability of attitudes to guide behavioral intentions. That is, attitudes were more predictive of behavioral intentions in participants with higher levels of perceived elaboration compared to those with relatively lower levels of subjective thinking.

In this paper reconfiguration of unbalanced distribution networks is presented with the objective of power loss minimization, voltage unbalance minimization, voltage sag improvement, and minimizing energy not supplied by the customers based on fuzzy multi-criteria approach (FMCA) using new improved corona-virus herd immunity optimizer algorithm (ICHIOA). The voltage unbalances and voltage sag is power quality criteria and also the ENS refers to the reliability index. Conventional CHIOA is inspired based on herd immunity against COVID-19 disease via social distancing and is improved using nonlinearly decreasing inertia weight strategy for global and local exploration improvement. The methodology is implemented as single and multi-objective optimization on 33 and 69 bus IEEE standard networks. Moreover, the performance of the ICHIOA in problem-solving is compared with some well-known algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), moth flame optimizer (MFO), ant lion optimizer (ALO), bat algorithm (BA) and also conventional CHIOA. The simulation results based on the FMCA showed that all criteria are improved with reconfiguration due to compromising between them while in single-objective optimization, some criteria may be weakened. Also, the obtained results confirmed the superiority of the ICHIOA in comparison with the other algorithms in achieving better criteria with lower convergence tolerance and more convergence accuracy. Moreover, the results cleared that the ICHIOA based on FMCA is capable to determine the best network configuration optimally to improve the power loss, voltage sag, voltage unbalance, and ENS in different loading conditions.","output":"An improved corona-virus herd immunity optimizer algorithm for network reconfiguration based on fuzzy multi-criteria approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathogenesis describes the spread of a virus in the organism and the mutual relationship between the pathogen and its host during infection.

This study aimed to investigate the differences in our surgical approach to kidney stone cases between the COVID-19 period and pre-COVID-19 period. Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) for kidney stones in our clinic between March 11, 2020, and September 11, 2020, and those in the same period 1 year ago were included in the study. Demographic information, laboratory data, stone characteristics, treatment choices and results were evaluated comparatively. Results: A total of 39 patients in the COVID-19 period (group 1) and 93 patients in the pre- COVID-19 period (group 2) underwent kidney stone surgery. While RIRS was performed to 32 of the patients in group 1, PNL was applied to seven of the patients in group 2. RIRS was performed to 70 patients in group 2, and PNL was applied to 23 of them. While the RIRS/PNL ratio was 4.5 in group 1, it was 3.04 in group 2. During the COVID-19 period, the number of patients who underwent PNL has decreased significantly. Conclusion: The number of elective surgery cases has significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is predicted that the incidence of organ loss will increase due to complications and delayed treatment. Moreover, interruption of the residents' surgical training secondary to the decreasing number of cases is one of the pandemic's critical drawbacks.","output":"Changes that have occurred in the surgical treatment preference for non-emergent kidney stones during the covid-19 pandemic: Six months of clinical experience in a tertiary referral centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the introduction of immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, major improvements have been achieved in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), with a significant impact on the outcome of this disease.

Whilst these approaches have seen both commercial and clinical success, uptake of these robots remains moderate because of their high cost, large physical footprint and long setup times. More recently, researchers have moved toward developing hand-held robots that are completely ungrounded and manipulated by surgeons in free space, in a similar manner to how conventional instruments are handled. These devices provide specific functions that assist the surgeon in accomplishing tasks that are otherwise challenging with manual manipulation. Hand-held robots have the advantages of being compact and easily integrated into the normal surgical workflow since there is typically little or no setup time. Hand-held devices can also have a significantly reduced cost to healthcare providers as they do not necessitate the complex, multi degree-of-freedom linkages that grounded robots require. However, the development of such devices is faced with many technical challenges, including miniaturization, cost and sterility, control stability, inertial and gravity compensation and robust instrument tracking.

These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known3C6. Here we report on the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers3,5,6. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection7,8. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.","output":"mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Poorer sleep health outcomes have been documented in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep health outcomes in specific population groups, including the sporting community, has not been extensively investigated. This study evaluated sleep health outcomes and their relationship with lifestyle behaviours during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period in Australian community tennis players. METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated sleep health outcomes and lifestyle behaviours using an online survey. The survey was disseminated online between the 24th of April and the 6th of June 2020 and comprised the Sleep Health Index, Sleep Satisfaction Tool and questions regarding weekly hours of tennis play, general physical activity, training location and alcohol consumption. Two-hundred and eighty-five individuals completed the survey. RESULTS: Compared to normative data, respondents displayed positive sleep health values during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period, with median values (IQR) of 85.3 (73.4, 91.7) and 64.8 (54.4, 73.4) for the Sleep Health Index and Sleep Satisfaction Tool, respectively.

METHODS: We reviewed the clinical documentation of six consecutive COVID-19 patients with primary spinal epidural abscess that we surgically managed over a 2-month period. These cases were analyzed for what concerns both the viral infection and the spinal abscess. RESULTS: The abscesses were primary in all cases indicating that no evident infective source was found. A primary abscess represents the rarest form of spinal epidural abscess, which is usually secondary to invasive procedures or spread from adjacent infective sites, such as spondylodiscitis, generally occurring in patients with diabetes, obesity, cancer, or other chronic diseases. In all cases, there was mild lymphopenia but the spinal abscess occurred regardless of the severity of the viral disease, immunologic state, or presence of bacteremia. Obesity was the only risk factor and was reported in two patients. All patients but one were hypertensive. The preferred localizations were cervical and thoracic, whereas classic abscess generally occur at the lumbar level. No patient had a history of pyogenic infection, even though previous asymptomatic bacterial contaminations were reported in three cases. CONCLUSION: We wonder about the concentration of this uncommon disease in such a short period. To our knowledge, cases of spinal epidural abscess in COVID-19 patients have not been reported to date. We hypothesize that, in our patients, the spinal infection could have depended on the coexistence of an initially asymptomatic bacterial contamination. The well-known COVID-19-related endotheliitis might have created the conditions for retrograde bacterial invasion to the correspondent spinal epidural space. Furthermore, spinal epidural abscess carries a significantly high morbidity and mortality.

Usually, the choice of technique (percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy [PDT] versus open surgical tracheotomy [OST]) depends on the preference of surgeons and patient-related factors. In case of COVID-19, airborne spread of viral particles and limited time of apnea must be considered in the choice of the safest technique. The aim of this study is to compare the complication rates and offer an assessment of relative risks and benefits of PDT versus OST in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study considering 47 consecutive patients affected by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, needing invasive mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy. This study was performed at the Intensive Care Unit of our tertiary referral center. Complication rates were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventeen patients underwent PDT and 30 patients were submitted to OST. Twenty-six patients (55.3%) had post-operative complications (local infection, hemorrhage, subcutaneous emphysema) with no significant difference between PDT and OST. CONCLUSION: PDT and OST are characterized by similar postoperative complication rates in severe COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that OST might be preferred if expert ENT surgeons are available, as PDT could result in longer apnea and exposure to generated aerosol. However, authors recommend considering either OST or PDT at the discretion of the medical staff involved, according to the personal experience of the operators performing the procedure.","output":"Comparison of percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy versus open surgical technique in severe COVID-19: Complication rates, relative risks and benefits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of our study was to comprehensively assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on knee and shoulder arthroscopy performed in an orthopedic department of a university hospital in Poland.

An effective, eco-friendly, and energy-efficient alternative disinfection technique is desirable to modernize and enhance wastewater treatment operations. Copper and nickel micro-structured metal foams, and a conventional copper mesh, were evaluated as disinfecting surfaces for treating secondary-treated wastewater contaminated with coliform bacteria. The micro-structured copper foam was adopted for scale-up study, due to its stable and satisfactory bactericidal performance obtained over a wide range of bacterial concentrations and metal-to-liquid ratios. Three scales of experiments, using two types of reactor designs, were performed using municipal wastewater to determine the optimal scale-up factors: small lab-scale batch reactor, intermediate lab-scale batch reactor, and pilot-scale continuous tubular reactor experiments. The performance was evaluated with the aim of minimizing metal material requirement with respect to bactericidal efficiency and leaching risks at all scales. Copper foam, at or above optimal conditions, consistently inactivated over 95 % of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and E.coli in wastewater at various scales, and leachate copper concentrations were determined to be below Canadian guideline values for outfall.

Sialoperoxidase is present in salivary secretions and in the biofilms that line the oral surfaces, while myeloperoxidase is abundant in the dento-gingival sulcus area. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), oral peroxidases catalyze the oxidation of the pseudohalide anion thiocyanate (SCN(?)) to hypothiocyanite (OSCN(?)), a strong oxidant that serves an antimicrobial role. Furthermore, oral peroxidases consume bacteria-produced H(2)O(2) and could help inactivate toxic carcinogenic and genotoxic substances. Numerous in vitro studies have reported the antibacterial, antimycotic and antiviral role of peroxidases, suggesting possible applications in oral therapy. However, the use of oral hygiene products incorporating peroxidase systems has not yet been shown to be beneficial for the treatment or prevention of oral infections. This paradox reflects our incomplete knowledge of the physiological role of peroxidases in a complex environment, such as the oral region. While hygiene is crucial for restoring oral microbiota to a symbiotic state, there are no data to suggest that the addition of a peroxidase per se can create a dysbiotic state. Recent investigations have associated the presence of peroxidase activity with gram-positive cocci microbial flora, and its insufficiency with dysbiosis has been linked to pathologies, such as caries, periodontitis or infections of the oral mucosa. Therefore, oxidants generated by oral peroxidases appear to be an essential ecological determinant for oral health through the selection of a symbiotic microbiota capable of resisting oxidative stress.

METHODS The study included liveborn twin and singleton pregnancies between January 2000 and January 2019. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) included gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia. The study outcomes were FGR or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) at birth as assessed using singleton and twin reference charts. RESULTS The analysis included 1473 twin and 62,432 singleton pregnancies. In singleton pregnancies the risk of PTB <34 weeks without HDP (OR 2.82, p < 0.001), delivery 34 weeks with HDP (OR 2.38, p < 0.001), and PTB <34 weeks with HDP (OR 13.65, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the pregnancies complicated by FGR compared to those without. When selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) was assessed using the singleton standard, the risk of PTB <34 weeks without HDP (OR 1.03, p = 0.872), delivery 34 weeks with HDP (OR 1.36, p = 0.160) were similar in the pregnancies complicated by sFGR compared to those without, while the risk of PTB <34 weeks with HDP (OR 2.41, p = 0.025) was significantly higher in the pregnancies complicated by sFGR compared to those without. When sFGR was assessed using the twin-specific chart, the risk of PTB <34 weeks without HDP (OR 3.55, p < 0.001), delivery 34 weeks with HDP (OR 3.17, p = 0.004), and PTB <34 weeks with HDP (OR 5.69, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the pregnancies complicated by sFGR compared to those without. The stronger and more consistent association persisted in the subgroup analyses according to chorionicity. The strength of association in dichorionic twin pregnancies resembles that of the singletons more closely and consistently when the FGR was diagnosed using the twin-specific charts. CONCLUSION FGR in twin pregnancies has a stronger and more consistent association with HDP and PTB when using twin-specific rather than singleton charts.

The most common approaches used to comprehend this abuse, violence, or mistreatment have not fully achieved a balance between theoretical perspectives and empirical assessment. To contribute to a more accurate account of the cultural driving forces, institutional conditions, direct expressions, and individual perceptions that undermine or preserve what we define as integrity at birth, we develop a new theoretical approach and a multi-level model. PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: We ground the terminology for integrity at birth upon theoretical foundations, referring to two theoretical discourses: medicalization and risk theory on the one hand, and embodiment and intersectionality theory on the other. We then contextualize this in a multi-level model in order to operationalize its potential for public health research. RESULTS: The concept and model of integrity at birth recognize that women in labor suffer from a number of gender-specific violations, which can be expressed at all levels (macro to micro) as implicit, inherent, normalized and invisible, or explicit, intentional, visible and socially accepted. In distinguishing six separate domains, we propose a theoretical contribution for obstetric care practices. CONCLUSION: Integrity at birth, as a multi-level and theoretically grounded approach, constitutes an important step towards raising awareness about this issue beyond the dimensions that have been studied to date in quantitative health research. Beyond available evidence of disrespectful and abusive practices constituting violations to integrity at birth, this study takes a step towards understanding gender-based violence and inequalities of health at childbirth.","output":"[Birth integrity through the lens of medicalization, risk, embodiment, and intersectionality]./ Un regard thorique sur l'intgrit  la naissance : mdicalisation, thories du risque, embodiment et intersectionnalit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After a year of living with the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated consequences, hope looms on the horizon thanks to vaccines. The question is what percentage of the population needs to be immune to reach herd immunity, that is to avoid future outbreaks. The answer depends on the basic reproductive number, R(0), a key epidemiological parameter measuring the transmission capacity of a disease. In addition to the virus itself, R(0) also depends on the characteristics of the population and their environment. Additionally, the estimate of R(0) depends on the methodology used, the accuracy of data and the generation time distribution. This study aims to reflect on the difficulties surrounding R(0) estimation, and provides Spain with a threshold for herd immunity, for which we considered the different combinations of all the factors that affect the R(0) of the Spanish population. Estimates of R(0) range from 1.39 to 3.10 for the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variant, with the largest differences produced by the method chosen to estimate R(0). With these values, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) ranges from 28.1 to 67.7%, which would have made 70% a realistic upper bound for Spain. However, the imposition of the delta variant (B.1.617.2 lineage) in late summer 2021 may have expanded the range of R(0) to 4.02C8.96 and pushed the upper bound of the HIT to 90%.","output":"Caveats on COVID-19 herd immunity threshold: the Spain case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the 2020 turmoil surrounding the U.S. Postal Servicea crisis not seen since roughly 209,000 employees struck its predecessor the U.S. Post Office Department in March 1970, which led to passage of the Postal Reorganization Act that summer and the inauguration of the USPS in July 1971.

While effective at reducing the computation overhead, all such approaches still require the costly movement of a large amount of data from storage to the rest of the system, which can significantly lower the end-to-end performance of read mapping in conventional and emerging genomics systems. We propose GenStore, the first in-storage processing system designed for genome sequence analysis that greatly reduces both data movement and computational overheads of genome sequence analysis by exploiting low-cost and accurate in-storage filters. GenStore leverages hardware/software co-design to address the challenges of in-storage processing, supporting reads with 1) different read lengths and error rates, and 2) different degrees of genetic variation. Through rigorous analysis of read mapping processes, we meticulously design low-cost hardware accelerators and data/computation flows inside a NAND flash-based SSD. Our evaluation using a wide range of real genomic datasets shows that GenStore, when implemented in three modern SSDs, significantly improves the read mapping performance of state-of-the-art software (hardware) baselines by 2.07-6.05$\\\\times$ (1.52-3.32$\\\\times$) for read sets with high similarity to the reference genome and 1.45-33.63$\\\\times$ (2.70-19.2$\\\\times$) for read sets with low similarity to the reference genome.","output":"GenStore: A High-Performance and Energy-Efficient In-Storage Computing System for Genome Sequence Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since January 30, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the SARS CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) to be a public health emergency of international concern, the National Library of Medicine's (NLM's) Web Collecting and Archiving Working Group has been collecting a broad range of web-based content about the emerging pandemic for preservation in an Internet archive Like NLM's other Global Health Events web collections, this content will have enduring value as a multifaceted historical record for future study and understanding of this event This article describes the scope of the COVID-19 project;some of the content captured from websites, blogs, and social media;collecting criteria and methods;and related COVID-19 collecting efforts by other groups The growing collection-2,500 items as of June 30, 2020-chronicles the many facets of the pandemic: epidemiology;vaccine and drug research;disease control measures and resistance to them;effects of the pandemic on health care institutions and workers, education, commerce, and many aspects of social life;effects for especially vulnerable groups;role of health disparities in infection and mortality;and recognition of racism as a public health emergency","output":"The National Library of Medicine Global Health Events web archive, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic collecting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes significan t morbidity, mainly from pulmonary involvement, extrapulmonary symptoms are also major componen ts of the disease. Kidney disease, usually presenting as AKI, is particularly severe among patients with COVID-19. It is unknown, however, whether such injury results from direct kidney infection with COVID-19's causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or from indirect mechanisms. METHODS: Using ex vivo cell models, we sought to analyze SARS-CoV-2 interactions with kidney tubular cells and assess direct tubular injury. These models comprised primary human kidney epithelial cells (derived from nephrectomies) and grown as either proliferating monolayers or quiescent three-dimensional kidney spheroids. RESULTS: We demonstrated that viral entry molecules and high baseline levels of type 1 IFN-related molecules were present in monolayers and kidney spheroids. Although both models support viral infection and replication, they did not exhibit a cytopathic effect and cell death, outcomes that were strongly present in SARS-CoV-2-infected controls (African green monkey kidney clone E6 [Vero E6] cultures). A comparison of monolayer and spheroid cultures demonstrated higher infectivity and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in actively proliferating monolayers, although the spheroid cultures exhibited high er levels of ACE2. Monolayers exhibited elevation of some tubular injury molecules-including molecules related to fibrosis (COL1A1 and STAT6) and dedifferentiation (SNAI2)-and a loss of cell identity, evident by reduction in megalin (LRP2). The three-dimensional spheroids were less prone to such injury. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney cells without a cytopathic effect. AKI-induced cellular proliferation may potentially intensify infectivity and tubular damage by SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that early intervention in AKI is warranted to help minimize kidney infection.","output":"Human Kidney Spheroids and Monolayers Provide Insights into SARS-CoV-2 Renal Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) are important to understand during a pandemic when the population is expected to be compliant with rules and regulations An Arabic language KAP survey was used to assess residents of the largest governorate in Palestine during the COVID-19 outbreak in May 2020 Given the magnitude ofthe effects of the virus worldwide it was important to examine the community understanding of the disease and compliance with officialdom during the outbreak The data set consisted of 520 adults resident in Hebron area answering a 21 question self-administeredsurvey They had a mean knowledge score of 10 25 (SD: 2 01, range: 0-11) indicating a high level of knowledge, a good mean score for practices, 5 55 (SD: 2 29, range: 0-6), while they generally had positive attitudes scoring 3 13 (SD: 2 15, range: 0-4) This unique survey can provide valuable indicators for health planners in the future","output":"Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) during the COVID-19 pandemic among Palestinians in the Hebron governorate, Palestine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Germline variants in genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (i.e. ACE2 and TMPRSS2) may influence the susceptibility to infection, as may polymorphisms in genes involved in the innate host response to viruses (e.g. APOBEC3 family). We searched for polymorphisms acting, in lung tissue, as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for 15 candidate COVID-19 susceptibility genes, selected for their roles in virus cell entry and host antiviral responses. No significant eQTLs were identified for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, whose expression levels did not associate with either sex or age of the 408 patients whose non-diseased lung tissue was analyzed.

The genetic control of the expression of APOBEC3 genes, which encode enzymes that interfere with virus replication, may explain interindividual differences in risk or severity of viral infections. Future studies should investigate the role of host genetics in COVID-19 patients using a genome-wide approach, to identify other genes whose expression levels are associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity.

We searched for polymorphisms acting, in non-diseased lung tissue of 408 patients, as eQTLs for 15 candidate COVID-19 susceptibility genes, selected for their roles in virus cell entry and host antiviral responses. Seven cis-eQTLs were detected for APOBEC3D and APOBEC3G genes, which encode enzymes that interfere with virus replication. No significant eQTLs were identified for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes.

It is characterized by a broad tumor spectrum. To our best knowledge, only one Tunisian study with a confirmed LFS was published. METHODS Our study focused on the clinical, histopathological and genetic results of two patients with rare tumor phenotype and tried to establish genotype-phenotype correlation. The clinical diagnosis was based on Chompret-Bonaiti criteria relative to LFS. Molecular study was assessed using Sanger sequencing of the hotspot germline variants of TP53 gene. RESULTS We report 2 Tunisian families fulfilling the clinical criteria of Chompret-Bonaiti. The tumor phenotype was bilateral breast cancer (BC) in 27-year-old woman and multiple tumors for the second proband, with an onset age of 14, 35 and 36 yo for osteosarcoma, BC and esophageal cancer respectively. Each of them had a rare histological type of breast cancer associated with LFS, phyllode tumor and intralobular carcinoma. Both patients had cancer family history. The molecular study showed deleterious heterozygous germline TP53 variants in each index case: The first had a well-known hotspot missense variation c.742C>T p.(R248W) with a rare histological association, explaining genotype phenotype correlation. The second case had a nonsense variation c.159G>A p.(W53*), rare worldwide, extending the phenotype spectrum in LFS. Immunohistochemistry study in tumor samples confirmed the lack of p53 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS Conclusively, germline TP53 testing is primordial in patients with a family history suggestive of LFS for clinical practice avoiding genotoxic treatments and adapting the surveillance. National database in LFS listing clinical and mutational data is important to set, particularly for variants rarely reported worldwide.

METHODS: The precautions, test procedures, and risk factors associated with the practice of audiology were evaluated. The number and diagnoses of the cases between 23 March and 23 May 2020 were also compared with the results of the same 2 months in 2019 in an attempt to evaluate the alterations in the audiology practice. RESULTS: The audiology practice has continued during the pandemic, and numerous audiovestibular tests like newborn hearing screening, pure tone and speech audiometry, auditory brainstem response (ABR) test, bedside vestibular assessment, videomystagmography (VNG), caloric test, vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP), computerized dynamic posturography (CDP), video head impulse test (vHIT), intraoperative cochlear implant measurement, and postop cochlear implant fittings were performed. The number of tests has decreased significantly in the course of the pandemic (p < 0.01). No evidence of Covid-19 disease was detected in the audiology staff and patients. In general, no major risk was seen during testing under protective measures except for vestibular testing which induced vomiting and taking out the mask for lip reading during cochlear implant fitting in the elderly. CONCLUSION: It is possible to perform audiovestibular tests during the Covid-19 pandemic by wearing necessary protective equipment and disinfecting the potential surfaces. Vomiting during vestibular tests, uncovering the nose and mouth for lip reading, and small-sized test cabins are the main risk factors of contamination in the audiology clinics.","output":"Significance of continuing audiovestibular practice during Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Variation of the estimated serial interval and generation time introduces heterogeneity in COVID-19 transmission models. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate more precise serial intervals and generation times of COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the WHO Global COVID-19 Literature database from 1 January 2020 to 30 April 2021. A single reviewer performed the data extraction. A random-effects model was used to pool the estimates. Subgroup analysis was performed to check the estimates for heterogeneity by geographical region and the presence of lockdown measures. RESULTS: A total of 222 articles were retrieved of which 73 articles were included based on the selection criteria. Serial intervals were reported in 65 articles that provided 75 unique estimates from 16,805 transmission pairs. Generation intervals were reported in 9 articles that provided 9 unique estimates from 1,150 transmission pairs. The pooled serial interval was 5.00 days (95% CI: 4.68, 5.33). The pooled generation time was 4.37 days (95% CI: 3.58, 5.16). The serial interval estimates did not vary by either geographical region (P > 0.05) or the presence of lockdown measures (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides more precise pooled serial and generation intervals that may decrease misspecifications of future transmission models.

Approximately 70 inmates work at an onsite dairy, which provides milk to all state-run correctional facilities in Colorado. CDPHE immediately began an investigation and was later assisted by the High Plains Intermountain Center for Agricultural Health and Safety at Colorado State University and by CDC.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) testing indicated that STEC O111 isolates from inmates matched STEC O111 isolates from cattle at the onsite dairy. An environmental investigation determined that inmates employed at the dairy might have acquired STEC O111 infection on the job or transported contaminated clothing or other items into the main correctional facility and kitchen, thereby exposing other inmates.

This study evaluated the impact of thoracic trauma and pulmonary failure on outcomes in trauma patients admitted to the intensive-care unit (ICU). METHODS: All trauma patients admitted to the ICU over an 8-year period were identified. Patients that died within 48 h of arrival were excluded. Patients were stratified by baseline characteristics, injury severity, development of ARDS, and infectious complications. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine variables significantly associated with the development of ARDS. RESULTS: 10,362 patients were identified. After exclusions, 4898 (50%) patients had chest injury and 4975 (50%) did not. 200 (2%) patients developed ARDS (3.6% of patients with chest injury and 0.5% of patients without chest injury). Patients with ARDS were more likely to have chest injury than those without ARDS (87% vs 49%, p < 0.001). However, of the patients without chest injury, the development of ARDS still led to a significant increase in mortality compared to those patients without ARDS (58% vs 5%, p < 0.001).

METHODS: This integrative review was conducted using the keywords multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, Kawasaki-like syndrome, COVID, COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2. Initially, 324 articles were found. All were screened, and 34 were included. Eight articles were added after hand-searching and weekly literature searches were conducted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is a newly identified syndrome, thus information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes is available but evolving. Many aspects of nursing care are important to consider with regard to this illness, including COVID precautions, physical assessments, medication administration, and timing of blood sampling for laboratory testing as well as other standard intensive care unit considerations.

Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, in cultured cells. The effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 M. Ciclesonide inhibited formation of double membrane vesicles, which anchor the viral replication-transcription complex in cells. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide still suppressed replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Importance The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. To identify the effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide suppresses replication of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses (MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in cultured cells.

Second, Otsus binarization and the HSV color model are applied to the image to eliminate the influence of eyelashes and canthi. Then, the method samples all of the pixel points on the limbus and applies the least square method to obtain the coordinate of the pupil center. Lastly, we calculated the distances from the pupil center to the medial and lateral canthus to measure the deviation of the positional similarity of two eyes for strabismus screening. RESULT: We used a total of 60 frontal facial images (30 strabismus images, 30 normal images) to validate the proposed method. The average value of the iris positional similarity of normal images was smaller than one of the strabismus images via the method (p-value<0.001).

METHOD A cross-sectional study of 3051 Spanish preschoolers (3-5 years). Fitness was measured by PREFIT fitness test battery and reported by parents using an adapted version of the IFIS. Waist circumference was evaluated, and the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was calculated. Seventy-six parents of randomly selected schoolchildren completed the IFIS twice (two weeks apart) for a reliability assessment. RESULTS ANCOVA, adjusted for sex, age and WHtR, showed that preschoolers who were scored by their parents as having average-to-very good fitness had better levels of measured physical fitness than those preschoolers who were classified as having \\"very poor/poor\\" fitness levels (18.1laps to 22.1laps vs 15.6laps for cardiorespiratory fitness; 6.6 kg to 7.5 kg vs 5.3 kg for muscular fitness-handgrip-; 71.7 cm to 76.4 cm vs 62.0 cm for muscular fitness-standing long jump-; 17.2s to 16.2s vs 18.2s for speed/agility; and 11.2s to 15.6s vs 8.7s for balance; p < 0.001).

Within rheumatology, telehealth has been used for, inter alia, follow-up for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with low disease activity or in remission. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of such a telehealth intervention. METHOD In a randomized controlled trial, 294 patients were randomized into patient-reported outcome-based telehealth follow-up by either a nurse (PRO-TN) or a rheumatologist (PRO-TR) or to conventional outpatient follow-up (control). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Individual-level healthcare and productivity costs were retrieved from national Danish registers. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for the intervention groups compared to the control group. Bootstrapping with 10 000 replications was used to obtain confidence intervals. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated. RESULTS The cost comparison showed that PRO-TR was significantly less costly than the control group, whereas the relative reduction in costs for PRO-TN was not significant. The telehealth groups experienced minor, non-significant declines in QALYs, whereas the control group experienced a slight, non-significant increase. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that for PRO-TR, the willingness to accept a QALY loss was 89 328 EUR. A similar but smaller and non-significant result was seen for PRO-TN. CONCLUSION PRO-TR and PRO-TN seem to cost less but provide broadly similar health outcomes compared with conventional follow-up. Between the intervention groups, PRO-TR was significantly less costly.

Methods. IgG neutralizing antibodies against the Trimeric complex (IgG-TrimericS) were measured at four time points: at baseline, at day 21 after vaccine dose-1, at one month and three months after dose-2. Nucleocapsid antibodies were assessed to detect prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Waist circumference was measured to determine abdominal obesity. Results. Between the first and third month after vaccine dose-2, the drop in IgG-TrimericS levels was more remarkable in individuals with AO compared to those without AO (2.44 fold [95%CI: 2.22-2.63] vs 1.82 fold [95%CI: 1.69-1.92], respectively, p<0.001).

However, intervention studies that verify whether recommended ventilation targets can be achieved in practice with reasonable ventilation regimes and that are also suitable for countries with cold winters are practically non-existent. To explore the initial situation in Switzerland we carried out carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements during the winter in 100 classrooms, most of which (94%) had natural window ventilation. In more than two thirds of those, the hygienic limit value of 2000 ppm specified for CO2 in the Swiss Standard SN 520180 (2014) was exceeded. To improve ventilation behavior, an intervention was implemented in 23 classrooms during the heating season. Ventilation was performed exclusively during breaks (to avoid discomfort from cold and drafts), efficiently, and only for as long as was necessary to achieve the ventilation objective of compliance with the hygienic limit value (strategic ventilation). The intervention included verbal and written instructions, awareness-raising via a school lesson and an interactive tool for students, which was also used to estimate the required duration of ventilation. CO2 exposure was significantly reduced in pilot classes (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 3.815e-06). Median CO2 levels decreased from 1600 ppm (control group) to 1097 ppm (intervention group), and the average proportion of teaching time at 400-1400 ppm CO2 increased from 40% to 70%. The duration of ventilation was similar to spontaneous natural window ventilation (+5.8%). Stricter ventilation targets are possible.

The purpose of this article is to review the experiences of an integrated urban health system, exploring the strategic tactics to ensure effective communication between team members, patient and family engagement in discharge planning, establishing and maintaining trust, connecting patients to appropriate next level of care services, and providing transitional care management support. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS The Covid-19 pandemic response stimulated the rapid transformation of the acute care management model amidst the tremendous challenge of meeting the discharge planning needs of the hospitalized population in one large, urban, integrated health care system. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS Patients transitioning to the community setting following discharge are vulnerable and at risk for adverse sequelae, and transitional care management that does not end when the patient leaves the hospital setting is integral to promoting positive patient outcomes (Naylor, Aiken, Kurtzman, Olds, & Hirschman, 2011). The care management approach during the pandemic in one health care system precipitously shifted to an entirely virtual, remote model, and the team continued to provide transitional care support for hospitalized patients to avoid the common pitfalls that are associated with unfavorable outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE The insights gleaned from one health system's experiences during the pandemic are transferable to other facets of care management in routine circumstances, with emphasis on the avoidance of the common care management snares that lead to less than optimal patient outcomes. The development and implementation of multifaceted interventions, with the goals of supporting health-promoting behavior changes and self-care capacity for at risk populations, are relevant in the current health care environment.","output":"Acute Care Management During a Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced \\"Coronavirus disease 19\\" or \\"COVID-19\\" as a novel coronavirus in March 2020.

In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 [9]. Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the entry receptor for the infection process involving membrane fusion [10]. A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the time delay given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the exposure time to the interaction time (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. Background The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the -coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. Methods A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. Results A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies.

We used routinely collected health care data, and included all patients with an autoimmune bullous disease who presented to the hospital between 2001 and 2016. RESULTS: Out of the 4736 patients who were admitted to the hospital during the study period, 923 (19.5%) had an autoimmune bullous disease.

We performed age-stratified analysis to identify different contributing SDOH and quantify their effects by age groups. METHODS: We included all reported COVID-19 positive cases confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing between March 19th (first case reported) and December 16th, 2020 in Cameron County, TX. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were aggregated to weekly counts by census tracts.

The most significant association was related to the \\"shelter-in-place\\" variable, where the incidence risk of COVID-19 was reduced by over 50% comparing the time periods when policy present vs policy absent (RR=0.506; 95% [0.454, 0.563]). Moreover, age-stratified analyses identified different significant contributing factors, and varying magnitude of the \\"shelter-in-place\\" effect. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, SDOH including social environment and local emergency measure were identified in relation to COVID-19 incidence risk at the census tract level in a highly disadvantaged population with limited health care access and high prevalence of chronic conditions. Results from our analysis provide key knowledge to design efficient testing strategies and assist local public health departments for COVID-19 control, mitigation and implementation of vaccine strategies.","output":"Census Tract Patterns and Contextual Social Determinants of Health Associated with COVID-19 in a Hispanic Population from South Texas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical pharmacists' routine task is carrying out pharmaceutical care to ensure patients' safe and reasonable medication use. However, under public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, the work strategies of clinical pharmacists need to be modified according to the rapid spread of the disease, where information and resources are usually lack to guide them. OBJECTIVE: To retrieve and investigate the prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists during the outbreak of novel coronavirus, summarize the roles and responsibilities of clinical pharmacists, and to propose innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services under the epidemic. METHODS: The Chinese and English databases, self-media network, website of professional society or medical institution, and clinical trial center platforms were searched, and clinical pharmacists involved in the work against COVID-19 were surveyed and interviewed.

This study aim to describe the epidemiological course of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 and their impact on hospital bed occupancy rates in the first 45 days of the epidemic in the state of Cear, Northeastern Brazil. METHODS: The study used an ecological design with data gathered from multiple government and health care sources. Data were analyzed using Epi Info software. RESULTS: The first cases were confirmed on March 15, 2020. After 45 days, 37,268 cases reported in 85.9% of Cears municipalities, with 1,019 deaths. Laboratory test positivity reached 84.8% at the end of April, a period in which more than 700 daily tests were processed. The average age of cases was 67 (<1 - 101) years, most occurred in a hospital environment (91.9%), and 58% required hospitalization in an ICU bed. The average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 18 (1 - 56) days. Patients who died in the hospital had spent an average of six (0 - 40) days hospitalized. Across Cear, the bed occupancy rate reached 71.3% in the wards and 80.5% in the ICU.

However, the scientific landscape on the integration of GIS in COVID-related studies is largely unknown. In this systematic review, we assessed the current evidence on the implementation of GIS and other geospatial tools in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We systematically retrieved and reviewed 79 research articles that either directly used GIS or other geospatial tools as part of their analysis. We grouped the identified papers under six broader thematic groups based on the objectives and research questions of the study- environmental, socio-economic, and cultural, public health, spatial transmission, computer-aided modeling, and data mining. Results: The interdisciplinary nature of how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19 research was notable among the reviewed papers. Although GIS has substantial potential in planning to slow down the spread, surveillance, contact tracing, and identify the trends and hotspots of breakdowns, it was not employed as much as it could have been. This review not only provided an overarching view on how GIS has been used in COVID-19 research so far but also concluded that this geospatial analysis and technologies could be used in future public health emergencies along with statistical and other socio-economic modeling techniques. Our systematic review also provides how both scientific communities and policymakers could leverage GIS to extract useful information to make an informed decision in the future. Conclusions: Despite the limited applications of GIS in identifying the nature and spatio-temporal pattern of this raging pandemic, there are opportunities to utilize these techniques in handling the pandemic. The use of spatial analysis and GIS could significantly improve how we understand the pandemic as well as address the underserviced demographic groups and communities.","output":"Applications of GIS and geospatial analyses in COVID-19 research: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abalone is one type of shellfish that has high economic value.

Disasters disproportionately impact women and girls, with some evidence suggesting that violence against women and girls (VAWG) increases in disaster settings. Suggested risk factors for postdisaster VAWG include increased life stressors, failure of law enforcement, exposure to high-risk environments, exacerbation of existing gender inequalities and unequal social norms. We aim to systematically appraise the global literature on the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the following databases: Embase, Global Health, Medline, PubMed and Social Policy and Practice and searched grey literature. We included quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods studies published in English language that examined the association between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG. We summarised the findings using a narrative synthesis approach. RESULTS: Of 555 non-duplicate records, we included a total of 37 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Among the quantitative studies, eight studies found a positive association between disaster exposure and increased VAWG, and four additional studies found positive associations with some violence types but not others. Qualitative findings offered insights into three hypothesised pathways: disaster exposure associated with (1) an increase of stressors that trigger VAWG; (2) an increase of enabling environments for VAWG and (3) an exacerbation of underlying drivers of VAWG. CONCLUSION: As the first known global systematic review on the relationship between disasters from natural hazards and VAWG, this review contributes to the evidence base. We were limited by the quality of quantitative studies, specifically study designs, the measurement of variables and geographic scope. The severe health consequences of VAWG and increasing frequency of extreme events means that rigorously designed and better quality studies are needed to inform evidence-based policies and safeguard women and girls during and after disasters.","output":"Natural hazards, disasters and violence against women and girls: a global mixed-methods systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The two fields of machine learning and graphical causality arose and developed separately.

Objective: to evaluate efficacy of tocilizumab in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Design: multicenter single-arm phase 2 trial, powered to detect 10% absolute lethality rate reduction at 14 and 30-days, with 20% and 35% expected rates. A consecutive prospective validation cohort was also evaluated. Setting: 185 Italian public hospitals, during coronavirus breakout. Patients: 1221 patients hospitalized with pneumonia, from March 19th to 24th, 2020. Intervention: tocilizumab 8 mg/kg, intravenously, one or two administrations with 12 hours interval. Measurements: lethality rates at 14 and 30-days; safety according to CTCAE. Results: 301 and 920 cases were available for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis in phase 2 and validation cohorts. Due to delayed drug availability, 60% of patients received tocilizumab, and with some delays. In phase 2, 67 patients died; lethality rates were 18.4% (97.5%CI: 13.6-24.0, P=0.52) and 22.4% (97.5%CI: 17.2-28.3, P<0.001) at 14 and 30-days. Lower rates (15.6% and 20.0%) were reported in the modified ITT including only treated patients (mITT). Lethality rates in the validation cohort were smaller than in phase 2, at 14 and 30 days and in ITT and mITT populations. Multivariable logistic regression model suggests tocilizumab be more effective in patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline. No relevant signal of specific drug toxicity was reported, many severe adverse events being disease-related. Limitations: single-arm design. In addition, delayed availability of the drug induced indication bias and immortal time bias. Conclusion: Tocilizumab reduced lethality rate at 30 but not at 14-days, compared with the expectations, without significant toxicity.

Objective Given the high prevalence of asthma in the New York City area, our objective was to determine if underlying asthma was associated with poor outcomes among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease compared to patients without asthma. Methods Electronic heath records were reviewed for 1,298 sequential patients age <65 years without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were admitted to our hospital system with a confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Results The overall prevalence of asthma among all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 12.6%, yet a higher prevalence (23.6%) was observed in the subset 55 patients <21 years of age. There was no significant difference in hospital length of stay, need for intubation, length of intubation, tracheostomy tube placement, hospital readmission or mortality between asthmatic vs. non-asthmatic patients. Observations between asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients were similar when stratified by obesity, other comorbid conditions (i.e. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes), use of controller asthma medication and absolute eosinophil count. Conclusions Among hospitalized patients <65 years with severe COVID-19, asthma diagnosis was not associated with worse outcomes, regardless of age, obesity, or other high-risk comorbidities.

Research evidence (e.g., fMRI and survey studies) has suggested that poorer self-concept and stronger avatar identification are associated with problematic gaming. Player-avatar relationships have thus been proposed to require attention in gaming disorder assessment and interventions. To examine the interplay of player-avatar interactions in problematic gaming, this study investigated whether avatar identification differed according to avatar characteristics and game types, and whether the association between avatar identification and problem gaming was mediated by self-concept clarity. A total of 993 adult respondents completed an online survey that assessed problematic gaming, avatar identification, and self-concept clarity. The results indicated that avatar identification scores were generally unrelated to avatar characteristics (e.g., human resemblance, degree of customizability, and in-game perspective). Avatar identification was significantly positively related to problematic gaming and significantly negatively related to self-concept clarity. There was a significant indirect relationship between avatar identification on problem gaming mediated through self-concept clarity. These findings suggest that poorer self-concept clarity may be one mechanism by which avatar identification affects problem gaming. Future research with clinical samples may help to gain a better understanding of avatar-related processes and psychological vulnerabilities related to problematic gaming.","output":"Avatar identification and problematic gaming: The mediating role of self-concept clarity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first recognition that infectious microbes serve as the causes of many human diseases, physicians and scientists have sought to understand and control their spread.

In France, teachers and radiography students in initial training, not specially prepared for this, had to adapt. An evaluation of the system was proposed to the students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online questionnaire with 4 main sections (pedagogy, communication, learning and concerns) was sent to 91 students at the end of the semester. RESULTS: 91 responses were received. The slideshows with sound or presented during a virtual class are appreciated by the students. Online quizzes are ideal for learning/reviewing. For assessments, individual assignments and online questionnaires are appreciated. Teacher/student interaction via e-mail or video conferencing was considered satisfactory by the large majority of students. Student-student interactions via social networks, for course explanations or document exchange, are very suitable. The majority of students felt they were working a lot and much more compared to face-to-face teaching. Less than half of the students worked more than 20 h per week. Their motivation varied widely. Organizational habits were disrupted, but the autonomy granted was appreciated. The students were mainly concerned about the health of their loved ones and not about their own health. DISCUSSION: The use of distance education tools requires teacher commitment and technical skills. The frequency of communication by e-mail and/or videoconference between members of the teaching team and students must be adapted to the situation. Exchanges by e-mail allow for traceability, while videoconferencing allows direct interaction and a way out of isolation. Autonomy, appreciated by the students, was nevertheless combined with a strong variation in motivation; the anxiety-provoking period in which pedagogical continuity was built up may explain this contradictory observation.

METHODS: In 16 ICUs, we prospectively collected adverse events during or within 24 h after BAL and assessed the BAL input for decision making in consecutive adult patients. The occurrence of a clinical adverse event at least of grade 3, i.e., sufficiently severe to need therapeutic action(s), including modification(s) in respiratory support, defined poor BAL tolerance. The BAL input for decision making was declared satisfactory if it allowed to interrupt or initiate one or several treatments. RESULTS: We included 483 BAL in 483 patients [age 63 years (interquartile range (IQR) 53C72); female gender: 162 (33.5%); simplified acute physiology score II: 48 (IQR 37-61); immunosuppression 244 (50.5%)]. BAL was begun in non-intubated patients in 105 (21.7%) cases. Sixty-seven (13.9%) patients reached the grade 3 of adverse event or higher. Logistic regression showed that a BAL performed by a non-experienced physician (non-pulmonologist, or intensivist with less than 10 years in the specialty or less than 50 BAL performed) was the main predictor of poor BAL tolerance in non-intubated patients [OR: 3.57 (95% confidence interval 1.04C12.35); P = 0.04]. A satisfactory BAL input for decision making was observed in 227 (47.0%) cases and was not predictable using logistic regression.

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, cross-sectional study including 659 outpatients with migraine diagnosed by headache specialists. The participants were asked about the impacts of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache-related disability, headache days, headache intensity, stress, physical activity, hospital access and their work and home lives. For headache-related disability, the total Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score and part A and B scores were analysed. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to identify the clinical predictors of changes in the total MIDAS score before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors related to new-onset headache during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Finally, 606 migraine patients (73 M/533 F; age, 45.2  12.0 years) were included in the study, excluding those with incomplete data. Increased stress, substantial concern about COVID-19 and negative impacts of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life were reported in 56.8 %, 55.1 and 45.0 % of the participants, respectively. The total MIDAS and A and B scores did not significantly change after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. New-onset headache, which was observed in 95 patients (15.7 %), was associated with younger age and worsened mood and sleep in the logistic regression analysis. The multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis of changes in the total MIDAS score before and during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic identified worsened sleep, increased acute medication use, increased stress, medication shortages, comorbidities, the absence of an aura and new-onset headache were determinants of an increased total MIDAS score during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The weight-loss independent improvement of glycemic control observed after these procedures has led to the discussion whether bariatric surgery can be introduced as treatment for type 2 diabetes in patients with a body mass index < 35 kg/m(2). We have studied the effects of two bariatric procedures on type 2 diabetes and on gastrointestinal hormone secretion in a lean diabetic animal model. METHODS Male Goto-Kakizaki rats, 17-18 weeks old, were randomized into three groups: duodenojejunostomy (DJ), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or sham operation. During 36 postoperative weeks we evaluated body weight, fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance, insulin, HbA1c, glucagon-like peptide 1, cholesterol parameters, triglycerides, total ghrelin, and gastrin. RESULTS Oral glucose tolerance was significantly improved for both DJ and SG at four weeks after surgery (p < 0.05).

Predictors for severe COVID-19 infection have not been well defined. Determination of risk factors for severe infection would enable identifying patients who may benefit from aggressive supportive care and early intervention. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of 197 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to a tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS: Of 197 hospitalized patients, the mean (SD) age of the cohort was 60.6 (16.2) years, 103 (52.3%) were male and 156 (82.1%) were black. Severe COVID-19 infection was noted in 74 (37.6%) patients, requiring intubation. Patients aged above 60 were significantly more likely to have severe infection. Patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have diabetes, renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease and had significantly higher white blood cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to patients with non-severe infection. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, risk factors for severe infection included pre-existing renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% CI 2.5-22.0), oxygen requirement at hospitalization (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.7), acute renal injury (OR, 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.6) and initial CRP (OR,1.006; 95% CI, 1.001-1.01).

Simulations provided to younger normal-hearing adults were used to investigate the effect of sensation level, speech presentation level, and spectral shape in comparison to older adults with hearing loss. Method Measures were assessed in quiet, steady-state noise, and speech-modulated noise. Older adults with hearing loss listened to speech that was spectrally shaped according to their hearing thresholds. Younger adults with normal hearing listened to speech that simulated the hearing-impaired group's (a) reduced audibility, (b) increased speech levels, and (c) spectral shaping. Group comparisons were made based on speech recognition performance and masking release. Additionally, younger adults completed measures of listening effort and perceived speech quality to assess if differences across simulations in these outcome measures were similar to those for speech recognition. Results Across the various simulations employed, testing in the presence of a threshold matching noise best matched differences in speech recognition and masking release between younger and older adults. This result remained consistent across the other two outcome measures. Conclusions A combination of audibility, speech level, and spectral shape factors is required to simulate differences between listeners with normal and impaired hearing in recognition, listening effort, and perceived speech quality. The use of spectrally shaped and amplified speech in the presence of threshold matching noise best provided this simulated control.

METHODS: Qualitative research methodology and the social cognitive theory were used. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted with children (aged 10C11 years) and their mothers, respectively, from two private and one public schools in Beirut, Lebanon. Thematic inductive analytical approach was adopted. RESULTS: A total of six FGDs and 11 in-depth interviews with mothers were conducted from February till November 2020. Four main overarching themes emerged. Theme 1 pertained to the different views of children and mothers regarding the meaning of healthy eating and physical activity and their perceived impact on children's wellbeing. Theme 2 revealed a set of intrapersonal, social, and environmental determinants, which were reported differently between children and their mothers. Participants in our study who were interviewed after the COVID-19 pandemic talked about how their eating habits were adversely affected as a result of the sudden changes in daily schedules, boredom and anxiety. Theme 3 reflected the role of schools and sports facilities in setting a good example for children's healthy eating and active behaviors. Theme 4 revolved around participants suggestions to receive support for healthy eating and lifestyle habits at multiple levels, including intrapersonal, family/social, community, and policy-level strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of using theory-driven interventions, such as the social cognitive theory, to improve long-term health behaviors.

Vaccine hesitancy is a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite their availability. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify which people are more and less likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy to inform public health messaging. METHODS: A Canadian cross-sectional survey was conducted in Canada in October and November 2020, prior to the regulatory approval of the COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy was measured by respondents answering the question what would you do if a COVID-19 vaccine were available to you? Negative binomial regression was used to identify the factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Cluster analysis was performed to identify distinct clusters based on intention to take a COVID-19 vaccine, beliefs about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines, and adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: Of 4498 participants, 2876 (63.9%) reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with (1) younger age (18-39 years), (2) lower education, and (3) non-Liberal political leaning. Participants that reported vaccine hesitancy were less likely to believe that a COVID-19 vaccine would end the pandemic or that the benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine outweighed the risks. Individuals with vaccine hesitancy had higher prevalence of being concerned about vaccine side effects, lower prevalence of being influenced by peers or health care professionals, and lower prevalence of trust in government institutions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings can be used to inform targeted public health messaging to combat vaccine hesitancy as COVID-19 vaccine administration continues. Messaging related to preventing COVID among friends and family, highlighting the benefits, emphasizing safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, and ensuring that health care workers are knowledgeable and supported in their vaccination counselling may be effective for vaccine-hesitant populations.","output":"COVID-19 VaccineCRelated Attitudes and Beliefs in Canada: National Cross-sectional Survey and Cluster Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND COVID-19 has quickly become a worldwide threat to health, travel, and commerce.

METHODS: We performed a case-control study on patients that were PCR-tested for COVID-19 (112 positive and 112 negative participants), recruited during the first wave (March 2020 C May 2020) of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. Patients reported over by phone their symptoms and medical history and rated their olfactory and gustatory abilities before and during their illness on a 1-10 scale. RESULTS: Changes in smell and taste occurred in 68% (95% CI 60%-76%) and 72% (64%-80%), of positive patients, with 24 (11-53 range) and 12 (6-23) respective odds ratios. The ability to smell was decreased by 0.51.5 in negatives, and by 4.53.6 in positives.

Furthermore, we observed that Ace2 selected from seven animals based on the above analysis lack the hydrophobic contacts identified on human ACE2, indicating less affinity of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 to Ace2 in animals than humans. Finally, the alignment of 3D structure between human ACE2 and other animals by I\\\\TASSER and TM\\\\align displayed a reasonable structure for viral attachment within these species.

This review illustrates how regenerative medicine technology may contribute to the achievement of IFS. There are three possible strategies: organ bioengineering, immuno-isolation and thymus bioengineering. The goal of organ bioengineering is to manufacture organs ex vivo from autologous cells. Immuno-isolation technology implements strategies aiming to prevent recognition of nonself antigens by the host immune system. Thymus organoids have been bioengineered with scaffold-seeding methods to allow deletion of T-cell clones responsible for allograft rejection.

Scalable programs for school-based SARS-CoV-2 testing and surveillance are needed to guide in-person learning practices and inform risk assessments in K-12 settings. Objectives. To characterize SARS-CoV-2 infections in staff and students in an urban public school setting and evaluate test-based strategies to support ongoing risk assessment and mitigation for K-12 in-person learning. Design, Setting, and Participants. The pilot program engaged three schools for weekly saliva PCR testing of staff and students participating in in-person learning over a 5-week period. Wastewater, air, and surface samples were collected weekly and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA to determine surrogacy for case detection and interrogate transmission risk of in-building activities. Main Outcomes and Measures. SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva and environmental samples and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results. 2,885 supervised self-collected saliva samples were tested from 773 asymptomatic staff and students during November and December, 2020. 46 cases (22 students, 24 staff) were detected, representing a 5.8- and 2.5-fold increase in case detection rates among students and staff, respectively, compared to conventional reporting mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in wastewater samples from all pilot schools, as well as in air samples collected from two choir rooms. Sequencing of 21 viral genomes in saliva specimens demonstrated minimal clustering associated with one school. Geographic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 cases reported district-wide demonstrated higher community risk in zip codes proximal to the pilot schools. Conclusions and Relevance. Weekly screening of asymptomatic staff and students by saliva PCR testing dramatically increased SARS-CoV-2 case detection in an urban public-school setting, exceeding infection rates reported at the county level. Experiences differed among schools, and virus sequencing and geographic analyses suggest a dynamic interplay of school-based and community-derived transmission risk. Environmental testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air and surface samples enabled real-time risk assessment of in-school activities and allowed for interventions in choir classes. Wastewater testing demonstrated the utility of school building-level SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the performance and community value of test-based SARS-CoV-2 screening and surveillance strategies in the K-12 educational setting.","output":"Pilot program for test-based SARS-CoV-2 screening and environmental monitoring in an urban public school district"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland in accordance with the circadian rhythm when the light level decreases. Reduction of melatonin secretion with age may be associated with physiological aging in neurodegenerative diseases by affecting the suprachiasmatic nucleus or of the neuronal pathways of transmission to the pineal gland. A significant decrease in melatonin synthesis has been reported in various disorders and diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders (particularly diabetes type 2), cancer and endocrine diseases. In addition to the fact, that melatonin is a sleep inducer, it also exerts cytoprotective properties as an antioxidant and free radical scavenger. The therapeutic role of melatonin has been demonstrated in sleep disorders, eye damage and cardiovascular disease. The association between melatonin and -blockers has had a positive impact on sleep disorders in clinical trials. Previous studies have reported the anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin by adjusting levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-. Melatonin treatment has been demonstrated to decrease IL-6 and IL-10 expression levels and efficiently attenuate T-cell proliferation. Currently, there is an inconsistency of scientific data regarding the lowest optimal dose and safety of melatonin for long-term use.

Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocytes and the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Known for their function as phagocytic cells, neutrophils also capture and kill pathogens via elaboration of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETosis), and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antimicrobial peptides and proteases. Conversely, neutrophils also have been associated with immunopathology. For example, numerous studies have indicated that neutrophils play a role in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a major cause of death in COVID-19. We found that COVID-19 patients with ARDS have circulating neutrophils with a hyper-activated phenotype: elevated NETosis, ROS production and phagocytosis. While a small prospective clinical trial showed benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in mitigating respiratory comorbidity in COVID-19, and prior literature showed benefit of IVIG in viral ARDS, the exact mechanisms are not known. Current clinical therapeutic trials have targeted NET clearance following their release, but not aimed at preventing their formation. In concordance with previous findings, we hypothesized that inhibition of systemic activation of neutrophils with IVIG may reduce collateral tissue damage by blocking NETosis. Methods. Neutrophils from healthy controls were treated ex vivo with IVIG and NETosis, ROS production and phagocytosis quantified. Stimulants phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), for the canonical pathway, and nigericin, for the non-canonical pathway, were used. NETosis was quantified with Quant-iT? PicoGreen? dsDNA Assay (Invitrogen) and by NET visualization using myeloperoxidase staining;ROS production was assessed by OxyBURST? Green H2DCFDA (Invitrogen). Phagocytosis of pHrodo? Red S. aureus Bioparticles? (Invitrogen) was also quantified.Results. Ex vivo treatment of healthy neutrophils with IVIG was associated with a significant decrease in NETosis at concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/ml of IVIG (p&lt;0.0001;Figure 1A). IVIG suppression of NETosis was associated with a dose effect. ROS production was also diminished in all concentrations of IVIG tested, including as low as 0.2 mg/ml (p&lt;0.0001;Figure 1B). Phagocytosis was not only preserved but was boosted in the setting of IVIG treatment at 10 mg/ml (p&lt;0.05;Figure 1C).Conclusion. These ex vivo data utilizing fresh human neutrophils demonstrate the potential beneficial effect of IVIG, an FDAapproved treatment, in the context of neutrophil-mediated immunopathology. IVIG may be a potential treatment to prevent progression of vascular and lung inflammation and damage in COVID-19, consistent with emerging evidence of its therapeutic benefit in this disorder.

Currently, however, evidence that supports reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been reported. METHODS: We conducted whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA from clinical specimens at the initial infection and at the positive retest from 6 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via rRT-PCR after recovery. A total of 13 viral RNAs from the patients respiratory specimens were consecutively obtained, which enabled us to characterize the difference in viral genomes between initial infection and positive retest. RESULTS: At the time of the positive retest, we were able to acquire a complete genome sequence from patient 1, a 21-year-old previously healthy woman. In this patient, through the phylogenetic analysis, we confirmed that the viral RNA of positive retest was clustered into a subgroup distinct from that of the initial infection, suggesting that there was a reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 with a subtype that was different from that of the primary strain. The spike protein D614G substitution that defines the clade G emerged in reinfection, while mutations that characterize the clade V (ie, nsp6 L37F and ORF3a G251V) were present at initial infection.

The specific characteristics of these viruses that led to such distinct outcomes remain unclear. Here, we apply proteome-wide comparative structural analysis aiming to identify the unique molecular elements in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that may explain the differing consequences. By combining protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest non-conservative substitutions in functional regions of the spike glycoprotein (S), nsp1, and nsp3 that are contributing to differences in virulence. Particularly, we explain why the substitutions at the receptor-binding domain of S affect the structure-dynamics behavior in complexes with putative host receptors. Conservation of functional protein regions within the two taxa is also noteworthy. We suggest that the highly conserved main protease, nsp5, of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is part of their mechanism of circumventing the host interferon antiviral response. Overall, most substitutions occur on the protein surfaces and may be modulating their antigenic properties and interactions with other macromolecules. Our results imply that the striking difference in the pervasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV among humans seems to significantly derive from molecular features that modulate the efficiency of viral particles in entering the host cells and blocking the host immune response.","output":"Potential pathogenicity determinants identified from structural proteomics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19.

METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with otorhinolaryngological manifestation, ENT, and olfaction. RESULTS: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially.

At the beginning people knew that the respiratory system was attacked (97.9%); correctly identified the major symptoms of COVID-19 (95.0%) and ways to prevent infection: hand washing (99.8%), covering mouth (85.9%) and the need to call sanitary-epidemiological services if one experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (92.1%). The biggest changes between the first and second phase of the study concerned behaviours: more people wearing facial masks (+ 37.5%) and staying at home (+ 66.1%). Respondents in the second wave of the survey were also more scared of the pandemic (+ 19.6%), economic crisis (+ 64.1%), and worried about their families (+ 26.5%). However, they were less afraid of the quarantine (lockdown) (- 18.2%). Nurses and physicians were the most worried groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that even at the outset of the pandemic Polish population had a good initial knowledge about symptoms, transmission, and preventive behaviours regarding COVID-19. People revealed more short-term concerns, such as the worries about coping with quarantine and isolation. After a month, the knowledge and the concerns among the respondents changed. A shift towards long-term pandemic management issues was observed. Respondents reported to experience more fears concerning the pandemic in general, as well as economic and healthcare crises. Medical professionals reported higher level of fear of the pandemic than other groups included in this study. This study uses before-and-after approach which highlights the changes in people's knowledge and perception of the COVID-19 pandemic during the pandemic's progression.","output":"Before-and-after online community survey on knowledge and perception of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with Turner syndrome have adverse bone and cardiovascular outcomes from chronic estrogen deficiency. Hence, long-term estrogen replacement therapy is the cornerstone treatment. The estimates of its effect and optimal use, however, remain uncertain. We aimed to summarize the benefits and harms of estrogen replacement therapy on bone, cardiovascular, vasomotor and quality of life outcomes in patients with Turner syndrome. A comprehensive search of four databases was performed from inception through January 2016. Randomized clinical trials and observational cohort studies studying the effect of estrogen replacement therapy in patients with Turner syndrome under the age of 40 were included. Independently and in duplicate reviewers selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Subgroup analyses were based on route of administration and type of estrogen formulation. Twenty-five studies at moderate to high risk of bias (12 randomized trials, 13 cohort studies) with 771 patients were included. Using random-effects models, estrogen replacement therapy showed an increase in bone mineral density [weighted mean change from baseline 0.09 g/cm2 (0.04-0.14)] that differed by type of estrogen but not route of administration. Oral estrogen replacement therapy showed a higher increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels when compared to transdermal [weighted mean difference 9.33 mg/dl (4.82-13.85)] with no significant effect on other lipid fractions. The current evidence suggests possible benefit of estrogen replacement therapy on bone mineral density and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Whether this improvement translates into changes in patient important outcomes (cardiovascular events or fractures) remains uncertain. Larger randomized clinical trials with direct comparisons on patient important outcomes are necessary.","output":"Effect of estrogen replacement therapy on bone and cardiovascular outcomes in women with turner syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like protease (3CLpro) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96% identity) ortholog from the SARS-CoV All residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved Comparison of the polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved Based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart With the 3CLpro molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache The drugs Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes","output":"Prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) 3C-like protease (3CLpro) structure: virtual screening reveals velpatasvir, ledipasvir, and other drug repurposing candidates [version 1;peer review: 2 approved]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Medical students' psychological response to societal lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been studied much Objective To assess levels of anxiety and depression among medical students during initial stages of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal and relate their distress to relevant variables Method: A cross-sectional study with online questionnaire was conducted among medical students at different colleges in Nepal Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) detected 'anxiety' and 'depression' The covariates were explored by logistic regression analyses Result: A total 416 medical students [mean age: 22 2 (2 1);males 57 7%, females 42 3%] participated HADS-anxiety scores [mean: 7 1(4 3)] were significantly and positively correlated with HADS-depression [mean: 5 9 (4 1)] (r=0 695;p 22 years (AOR=2 2, 2 5 and 4 4 respectively) HADS-cAD was almost three-times higher among those with a possible COVID-19 exposure (AOR=2 8)","output":"Anxiety and depression during COVID-19 pandemic among medical students in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolism of -tocopherol derived from vitamin E-enriched transgenic maize (VER) and its effects on antioxidant and immune functions in broilers aged 1 to 42 days.

The negative control (NC) group and the positive control (PC) group were given non-GM maize and non-GM maize plus exogenous vitamin E (VE), respectively, and the VER group was given VER replacing the non-GM maize given to the NC group. Between days 1 and 21 and days 22 and 42, VE levels were 4.38 and 4.63 mg kg-1 in the NC group, and 14.11 and 14.91 mg kg-1 in the PC and VER group, respectively. RESULTS The results showed that -tocopherol from both VER and additives increased -tocopherol transfer protein and cytochrome P450 concentrations. Additionally, serum -tocopherol and -tocopherylquinone levels of broilers in the PC and VER groups were significantly higher than those in the NC group (P < 0.05).

METHODS: A literature review was performed in the PubMed/Medline database, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Academic Search Complete, Google Scholar, and CINAHL databases using the keywords COVID-19; phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors; cytokine storm; respiratory distress. RESULTS: Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, still no drugs are validated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in large-scale studies. While the progress toward a curative agent and/or vaccine is certainly hopeful, the principal limiting factor in such public health emergencies is always the time. Therefore, a preexisting licensed therapeutic(s) might offer a reprieve to the healthcare systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this context, the innovation of oral PDE5 inhibitors with their valuable effects on erection have provided a breakthrough in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and opened new fields of clinical application for this class of drugs. Oral PDE5 inhibitors have been demonstrated to possess many beneficial useful additional implications with acknowledged anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune response regulation, and antiapoptotic properties.

The etiology of the disease was unknown. Later, the researchers diagnosed the novel Coronavirus as the causal agent of this respiratory disease. On February 12th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named this disease Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Consequently, the disease spread globally and became a pandemic. As there is no specific treatment for the symptomatic patients and several vaccines are approved by WHO, the efficacy and effectiveness of these vaccines are not fully understood yet and the availability of these vaccines are very limited. In addition, new variants and mutants of SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be able to evade the immune system of the host. So, diagnosis and isolation of infected individuals is advised. Currently, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard method to detect novel Coronavirus, however, there are few limitations associated with RT-PCR such as false-negative results. This demanded another diagnostic tool to detect and isolate COVID-19 early and accurately. Chest computed tomography (CT) became another option to diagnose COVID-19 patients accurately (about 98% sensitivity). However, it did not apply to the asymptomatic carriers and sometimes the results were misinterpreted as from other groups of Coronavirus infection.

Previous studies have found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene coding for BSG and MCT1, as well as levels of the soluble form of BSG (sBSG), are potential biomarkers in various diseases. The goal of this study was to confirm BSG and MCT1 RNA overexpression in AML cell lines, as well as to analyse soluble BSG levels and selected BSG/MCT1 genetic variants as potential biomarkers in AML patients. We found that BSG and MCT1 were overexpressed in most AML cell lines. Soluble BSG was increased in AML patients compared to healthy controls, and correlated with various clinical parameters. High soluble BSG was associated with worse overall survival, higher bone marrow blast percentage, and higher white blood cell count. BSG SNPs rs4919859 and rs4682, as well as MCT1 SNP rs1049434, were also associated with overall survival of AML patients. In conclusion, this study confirms the importance of BSG/MCT1 in AML, and suggests that soluble BSG and BSG/MCT1 genetic variants may act as potential AML biomarkers.","output":"BSG (CD147) Serum Level and Genetic Variants Are Associated with Overall Survival in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Probably no topic has generated more excitement in the world of proteomics than the search for biomarkers.

Sweden has a strong tradition of health care databases, but information on patients' pathways to the ED is not documented in any registry. The aim of this study was to provide a national overview of pathways, degree of medical acuteness according to triage, chief complaints, and hospital admission rates for adult patients (18 years) visiting Swedish EDs during 24 h. METHODS: A national cross-sectional study including all patients at 43 of Sweden's 72 EDs during 24 h on April 25th, 2018. Pathway to the ED, medical acuteness at triage, admission and basic demographics were registered by dedicated assessors present at every ED for the duration of the study. Descriptive data are reported. RESULTS: A total of 3875 adult patients (median age 59; range 18 to 107; 50% men) were included in the study. Complete data for pathway to the ED was reported for 3693 patients (98%). The most common pathway was self-referred walk-in (n = 1310; 34%), followed by ambulance (n = 920; 24%), referral from a general practitioner (n = 497; 1 3%), and telephone referral by the national medical helpline \\"1177\\" (n = 409; 10%). In patients 18 to 64 years, self-referred walk-in was most common, whereas transport by ambulance dominated in patients > 64 years. Of the 3365 patients who received a medical acuteness level at triage, 4% were classified as Red (Immediate), 18% as Orange (very urgent), 47% as Yellow (Urgent), 26% as Green (Standard), and 5% as Blue (Non-Urgent). Abdominal or chest pain were the most common chief complaints representing approximately 1/3 of all presentations. Overall, the admission rate was 27%. Arrival by ambulance was associated with the highest rate of admission (53%), whereas walk-in patients and telephone referrals were less often admitted. CONCLUSION: Self-referred walk-in was the overall most common pathway followed by ambulance. Patients arriving by ambulance were often elderly, critically ill and often admitted to in-patient care, whereas arrival by self-referred walk-in was more common in younger patients.","output":"Pathways to the emergency department - a national, cross-sectional study in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the wellbeing of people worldwide, potentially increasing maladaptive psychological responses of vulnerable populations.

COVID-19 data from Texas Health and Human Services between March and August 2020 were analysed. COVID-19 incidence rate (cases per 100 000 population) was compared to statewide for selected urban and rural counties. We used joinpoint regression analysis to identify changes in trends of COVID-19 incidence and interrupted time-series analyses for potential impact of state EROP orders on COVID-19 incidence. We found that the incidence rate increased to 145.1% (95% CI 8.4-454.5%) through 4th April, decreased by 15.5% (95% CI -24.4 -5.9%) between 5th April and 30th May, increased by 93.1% (95% CI 60.9-131.8%) between 31st May and 11th July and decreased by 13.2% (95% CI -22.2 -3.2%) after 12 July 2020.

But it requires high uptake and continued participation across the population to be effective. To achieve sufficient uptake/participation, health authorities should address, and thus be aware of, user concerns. AIM: This work manually analyzes user reviews of the Irish Heath Service Executives (HSE) Contact Tracker app, to identify user concerns and to lay the foundations for subsequent, large-scale, automated analyses of reviews. While this might seem tightly scoped to the Irish context, the HSE app provides the basis for apps in many jurisdictions in the USA and Europe. METHODS: Manual analysis of (1287) user reviews from the Google/Apple playstores was performed, to identify the aspects of the app that users focused on, and the positive/negative sentiment expressed. RESULTS: The findings suggest a largely positive sentiment towards the app, and that users thought it handled data protection and transparency aspects well. But feedback suggests that users would appreciate more targeted feedback on the incidence of the virus, and facilities for more proactive engagement, like notifications that prompt users to submit their health status daily. Finally, the analysis suggests that the android battery issue and the backward-compatibility issue with iPhones seriously impacted retention/uptake of the app respectively. CONCLUSION: The HSE have responded to the publics desire for targeted feedback in newer versions, but should consider increasing the apps proactive engagement.

In this study, we investigated (a) whether perceived personal and group discrimination make distinct contributions to Chinese Canadians' negative affect and concern that the heightened discrimination they experienced during the pandemic will continue after the pandemic; (b) whether Canadian and Chinese identities and social support moderate the effect of discrimination on this concern; and (c) whether race-based rejection sensitivity (RS) explains why each type of discrimination predicts negative affect and expectation of future discrimination. METHOD A sample of Chinese Canadian adults across Canadian provinces (N = 516; Mage = 42.74, 53.3% females) completed a questionnaire assessing personal and group discrimination, Chinese and Canadian identity, a short form of race-based RS, negative affect, and expectation of future discrimination. RESULTS Personal and group discrimination were intercorrelated and positively associated with negative emotion and expectation of future discrimination. Chinese Canadians who identified more strongly as Chinese experienced a less adverse impact related to group discrimination. However, those who identified more (vs. less) strongly as Canadians were more likely to be impacted by personal discrimination. Finally, path analysis revealed that both personal and group discrimination were positively associated with RS, which in turn predicted an expectation that long-lasting racism would continue after the pandemic. CONCLUSION Group and personal discrimination play different roles in Chinese Canadians' experiences during and expectations after the pandemic.

Widespread use of face coverings has revealed challenges such as mask contamination and waste, presenting an opportunity to improve the current technologies. In response, we have developed the Auto-sanitizing Retractable Mask Optimized for Reusability (ARMOR). ARMOR is a novel, reusable face covering that can be quickly disinfected using an array of ultraviolet C lamps contained within a wearable case. A nanomembrane UVC sensor was used to quantify the intensity of germicidal radiation at 18 different locations on the face covering and determine the necessary exposure time to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in addition to other viruses and bacteria. After experimentation, it was found that ARMOR successfully provided germicidal radiation to all areas of the mask and will inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in approximately 180 seconds, H1N1 Influenza in 130 seconds, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 113 seconds, proving that this design is effective at eliminating a variety of pathogens and can serve as an alternative to traditional waste-producing disposable face masks.

However, real-world data on the outcomes of implementing preoperative screening processes during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking. We report the outcomes of implementing a comprehensive preoperative screening process for COVID-19 in a large-sized tertiary medical center for 72 days during the first peak of the outbreak. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent elective or emergency surgery at Asan Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) during the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea (February 23CMay 5, 2020). The preoperative screening process for COVID-19 included a chest X-ray and a detailed questionnaire on symptoms and epidemiological correlations to COVID-19. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and imaging studies were performed according to the presence of symptoms and epidemiological risks.

METHODS To be included, studies had to examine the impact of prolonged sitting lasting < 24 h in apparently healthy males or females of any age. Studies were identified from searches of the MEDLINE, CINAHL and SportDISCUS databases on July 6, 2016. Study quality was assessed using the Downs and Black Checklist; publication bias was assessed via funnel plot. RESULTS Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review; of these, 20 were included in the meta-analysis, which compared prolonged sitting to the effects of interrupting sitting with regular activity breaks on postprandial glucose, insulin and triglycerides. When compared to prolonged sitting, regular activity breaks lowered postprandial glucose (d = - 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.50 to - 0.21) and insulin (d = - 0.37, 95% CI - 0.53 to - 0.20), but not triglyceride responses (d = 0.06, 95% CI - 0.15 to 0.26).

Furthermore, widely utilized time-series filters for skeletal data denoising and smoothing for kinematics analysis, stochastic models for movement modeling, rule-based and template-based approaches for rehabilitation exercises assessment, and telerehabilitation sessions for remote health monitoring are explored. This article analyzes skeletal tracking methods by providing advantages and drawbacks of the state of the art rehabilitation sessions assessment, skeletal joint kinematics analysis, and MSK Telerehabilitation approaches. It also discusses the possible future research avenues to improve musculoskeletal disorder diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Our review signifies that RGB-D sensor-based approaches are inexpensive and portable for disorder diagnosis and treatment monitoring. It can also be a viable option for clinicians to provide contactless healthcare access to patients in the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A review of the evolution of scientific literature on technology-assisted approaches using RGB-D sensors for musculoskeletal health monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"the encouraging properties of statins, principally concerning their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity may represent the rationale for conducting prospective randomized controlled trials to verify whether statins may be advantageous in patients with COVID-19 and hyper-inflammation. statins use might improve survival among patients suffering from COVID-19 by mitigating against the hyper-inflammation through down-regulation of both IL-1 and IL-6 (Figure 1). On this regard, I conjecture that statins may be more feasible in terms of estimating costs and benefits when compared with IL-6 and IL-1 receptor antagonist. I think that statins are low-cost drugs that might concomitantly control both IL-1 and IL-6 overexpression, conversely IL-6 and IL-1 receptor antagonists are more expensive drugs that act on one or the other pro-inflammatory interleukin.

Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemic continues to spread exponentially around the world. Cancer patients have a higher risk of commorbidity than the rest of the population. Radiotherapy departments are actively involved in the management of these patients, whether they have covid or not, and it is recognized that the time taken to take charge and the continuity of treatment have a prognostic impact. The main objective was to assess the impact of the coronavirus on the treatment times of patients undergoing radiotherapy. Material and methods: This retrospective study was conducted in the radiotherapy department of Gustave-Roussy institute (France) during the period from March 3, 2020 to January 12, 2021. Organizational changes, patient care times between the day of the scan and the last radiotherapy session as well as the time taken to take charge of patients between the first session and the last radiotherapy session has been studied. Results: A total of 1183 patients were included, among which 60 had covid-19. Patients were divided into four categories. Treatment times of patients who did not have covid-19 and those of patients who did were not statistically significantly different. Conclusion: The organization of the radiotherapy department at the Gustave-Roussy institute is based on several points: carrying out preventive screening tests, protecting staff and patients and reorganizing the patient circuit. Thanks to the performance of diagnostic tests and the implementation of a specific workflow for patients with covid, we ensure the continuity of patient treatment in complete safety without impacting treatment times.","output":"Impact dun test de diagnostic du coronavirus positif sur le parcours du patient en radiothrapie  linstitut Gustave-Roussy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fossil fuels are the primary energy source of almost all societies and economies, but it is finite and scarce. The use of non-renewable fossil fuels threatens earths environment. At the same time, waste from agricultural and industrial activities is increasing. Most of this waste is discarded or poorly managed, causing many other environmental issues. Converting waste to energy is a promising route to address these challenges. We investigated the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of high moisture content, tobacco-processing waste in a multiple batch thermal reactor to produce biocrude oil. The effects of operating conditions were studied and optimized for maximum liquid biocrude oil yield. HTL operating conditions considered were temperatures from 280 to 340 C and residence times from 15 to 45 min for a fixed ratio of biomass to deionized water of 1:3. The reaction temperature was found to affect the yields and distribution of products significantly. The maximum yield of the liquid biocrude oil obtained was more than 52% w/w at 310 C and 15 min. Under these conditions, almost 90% of the energy was recovered in biocrude oil and solid products. The liquid fraction was mainly composed of phenols, ketones, and nitrogenous compounds. This study provides a potential framework for eco-technologies for biomass waste-to-energy conversion with respect to converting tobacco processing residues to liquid biofuels and biochemicals.

With the publication of the updated guidelines, we re-audited the same population cohort in 2020.MethodsA retrospective notes review was undertaken of all children with Down syndrome attending the child development centre. The results were compared to an audit undertaken in 2015. The notes were reviewed for documentation if a blood test offer was declined by the parents due to concerns of attending a health centre or non-compliance for other reasons.ResultsElectronic case records of 69 children aged 0C19 were reviewed. There were six infants and 63 children aged 1C19 years. Seventy percent of children were offered a dried blood spot test and 30% a venous blood test. Six children had a known diagnosis of autoimmune hypothyroidism. Two children during the study period had a TSH above the local reference range but below 10 and a normal fT4. The parents declined a repeat blood test within 1C5 days as recommended in updated guidelines. They both have received a repeat serum blood test within four months and the results remain marginally abnormal. No child tested received a new diagnosis of thyroid disorder.There was no documented evidence that parents were offered information on thyroid disorders and how to minimise the stress from blood tests.As per the updated guidance 2/6 infants had their thyroid status checked at 4C6 months. One infant was 3 weeks old at the time of the study. In three infants there was no documentation of the offer, 2/3 infants have not been offered a face a face consultation in the community due to COVID-19.In children above the age of one, 27% did not have their thyroid surveillance within 15 months compared to 3% in 2015. Four parents declined the test due to concerns around attending a health centre during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two young people declined the test due to needle phobia (similar to the cohort in 2015).Anecdotally it was evident that most children had an upward BMI trend, a delayed offer for hearing and vision assessments.ConclusionsThis audit highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the thyroid surveillance offer to children and young people with Down syndrome.

The CPM pipeline (development, validation, deployment, and impact assessment) is commonly viewed as a one-time activity, with model updating rarely considered and done in a somewhat ad hoc manner. This fails to address the fact that the performance of a CPM worsens over time as natural changes in populations and care pathways occur. CPMs need constant surveillance to maintain adequate predictive performance. Rather than reactively updating a developed CPM once evidence of deteriorated performance accumulates, it is possible to proactively adapt CPMs whenever new data becomes available. Approaches for validation then need to be changed accordingly, making validation a continuous rather than a discrete effort. As such, living (dynamic) CPMs represent a paradigm shift, where the analytical methods dynamically generate updated versions of a model through time; one then needs to validate the system rather than each subsequent model revision.","output":"Continual updating and monitoring of clinical prediction models: time for dynamic prediction systems?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Little is known about how sheltering in place to contain the spread of COVID-19 over extended periods affects individuals' psychological well-being. This study's objective was to analyze the factors associated with MSM's (men who have sex with men) low psychological well-being in the COVID-19 pandemic context. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted online across Brazil (26 states and federal district) in April and May 2020. The participants were recruited using snowball sampling and Facebook posts. Data were collected using social media and MSM dating apps. We estimated the prevalence, crude prevalence ratio (PR), and the respective confidence intervals (CI95%). Results: The prevalence of low psychological well-being found in the sample was 7.9%. Associated factors were belonging to the youngest group (PR 2.76; CI95% 1.90-4.01), having polyamorous relationships (PR 2.78; CI95% 1.51-5.11), not complying with social isolation measures (PR 6.27; CI95% 4.42-8.87), not using the social media to find partners (PR 1.63; CI95% 1.06-2.53), having multiple sexual partners (PR 1.80; CI95% 1.04-3.11), having reduced the number of partners (PR 2.67; CI95% 1.44-4.95), and group sex (PR 1.82; CI95% 1.23-2.69).

In bone, tumor cells promote an imbalance in bone remodeling via the release of growth factors that, directly or indirectly, stimulate osteoclast resorption activity. However, carcinoma cells are also characterized by an altered metabolism responsible for a decrease of extracellular pH, which, in turn, directly intensifies osteoclast bone erosion. Here, we speculated that tumor-derived acidosis causes the osteoblastCosteoclast uncoupling in BM by modulating the pro-osteoclastogenic phenotype of osteoblasts. According to our results, a low pH recruits osteoclast precursors and promotes their differentiation through the secretome of acid-stressed osteoblasts that includes pro-osteoclastogenic factors and inflammatory mediators, such as RANKL, M-CSF, TNF, IL-6, and, above the others, IL-8. The treatment with the anti-IL-6R antibody tocilizumab or with an anti-IL-8 antibody reverted this effect. Finally, in a series of BM patients, circulating levels of the osteolytic marker TRACP5b significantly correlated with IL-8. Our findings brought out that tumor-derived acidosis promotes excessive osteolysis at least in part by inducing an inflammatory phenotype in osteoblasts, and these results strengthen the use of anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-8 strategies to treat osteolysis in BM.","output":"Acid-Induced Inflammatory Cytokines in Osteoblasts: A Guided Path to Osteolysis in Bone Metastasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Among patients with acute ischemic stroke, we determine computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) thresholds associated with follow-up infarction at different stroke onset-to-CTP and CTP-to-reperfusion times. METHODS Acute ischemic stroke patients with occlusion on computed tomographic angiography were acutely imaged with CTP. Noncontrast computed tomography and magnectic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging between 24 and 48 hours were used to delineate follow-up infarction. Reperfusion was assessed on conventional angiogram or 4-hour repeat computed tomographic angiography. Tmax, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood volume derived from delay-insensitive CTP postprocessing were analyzed using receiver-operator characteristic curves to derive optimal thresholds for combined patient data (pooled analysis) and individual patients (patient-level analysis) based on time from stroke onset-to-CTP and CTP-to-reperfusion. One-way ANOVA and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression was used to test whether the derived optimal CTP thresholds were different by time. RESULTS One hundred and thirty-two patients were included. Tmax thresholds of >16.2 and >15.8 s and absolute cerebral blood flow thresholds of <8.9 and <7.4 mLmin(-1)100 g(-1) were associated with infarct if reperfused <90 min from CTP with onset <180 min. The discriminative ability of cerebral blood volume was modest. No statistically significant relationship was noted between stroke onset-to-CTP time and the optimal CTP thresholds for all parameters based on discrete or continuous time analysis (P>0.05). A statistically significant relationship existed between CTP-to-reperfusion time and the optimal thresholds for cerebral blood flow (P<0.001; r=0.59 and 0.77 for gray and white matter, respectively) and Tmax (P<0.001; r=-0.68 and -0.60 for gray and white matter, respectively) parameters.

The use of the ligament augmentation reconstruction system (LARS) is an alternative. Hypothesis: It was hypothesized that clinical outcomes would be similar in patients with increased body weight (>90 kg) or GLL, relative to controls. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A total of 66 patients satisfying the inclusion criteria were invited to participate and were divided into 3 groups: controls (no risk factors for inferior clinical outcome), patients with body weight >90 kg, and patients with GLL (Beighton score, 5 of 9). All patients underwent imbrication of the lateral collateral ligament complex augmented with the LARS. Primary outcomes of interest were Tegner activity scale (TAS) and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) subscale scores. Secondary outcomes were recurrence of ankle instability, the need for further surgery, and/or complications. Patients were reviewed at 2 and 5 years postoperatively, and outcomes between groups were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: Complete data were available for 63 patients (21 patients in each group). TAS improved in all groups from preoperatively to 2 years and 5 years postoperatively (P < .001 for all). Relative to the controls, the TAS scores were lower in the >90-kg group at 2 years and 5 years (P < .001 for both periods), while the GLL group had similar scores to controls at both postoperative periods.

In terms of assays, the historically accepted plate culture method takes 10 days for confirmed Legionella spp. results, has variabilities which affect trending and comparisons, requires highly trained personnel to identify colonies on a plate in specialist laboratories, and does not recover viable-but-non-culturable bacteria. PCR is sensitive, specific, provides results in less than 24 h, and determines the presence/absence of Legionella spp. and/or L. pneumophila DNA. Whilst specialist personnel and laboratories are generally required, there are now on-site PCR options, but there is no agreement on comparing genome units to colony forming units and action limits.

OCT can be synthesized by using unsubstituted benzophenone (BP), a possible human carcinogen. OBJECTIVES To verify if, and to what extent, BP residues are present in OCT-containing consumer products. METHODS The raw material of OCT and 39 skincare products, of which 28 containing OCT, were chemically analyzed for the presence of BP by means of Liquid Chromatography (LC). RESULTS In the OCT raw material and in all 28 OCT-containing products the presence of BP could be demonstrated, mostly in concentrations above 10 ppm (0.001%), whereas a majority of OCT-free products (8/11; 73%) did not contain BP. Moreover, BP concentrations significantly increased, in a time- and temperature-dependent manner, likely due to the additional degradation of OCT. CONCLUSIONS Photo-allergic contact dermatitis from OCT in patients photo-sensitized to KP might rely on residual BP impurities. Toxicological and ecological studies that evaluate the safety of OCT might also need to consider the concomitant presence of BP. This article is protected by copyright.

To address this gap, the Canadian Red Cross (in collaboration with local, provincial, territorial, national, and Indigenous partners) have leveraged international experience in humanitarian response and preparedness, developing innovative new response services, delivery modalities, and protocol through which to mitigate and manage risk. This approach breaks down emergency management into two main streams - health interventions and disaster management - to innovatively and effectively cope with increasingly complex and frequent requests for support. Using internal data from within the Canadian Red Cross, this paper presents and discusses the services, roles and expectations of this two-stream approach which has been designed to (i.) support COVID-19 testing and vaccination, (ii.) support outbreak crisis management, especially through epidemic, prevention, and control interventions, and (iii.) support traditional emergency management responses in the midst of a pandemic. It concludes by reporting on the successes of the two-stream approach to date while scoping further the potential evolutionary track of some of these services, their underpinning methodology, and appetite for recovery operations in the near future. This approach may therefore be of value to other organizations or practitioners coping with emergency management challenges during a pandemic. ? 2021 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM.

In this case, intervening PTSD of medical staff and preparing them for future outbreaks are important. Previous studies showed that perceived stress was related to the development of PTSD. Hence, in this study, the association between risk perception of medical staff and PTSD symptoms in COVID-19 and the potential links were explored. Three hundred four medical staff's exposure to COVID-19 patients, risk perception for working during COVID-19, PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and sleep quality were measured. Mediation analysis tested the indirect effects of anxiety and sleep quality on the relationship between risk perceptions and PTSD symptoms; 27.6% of participants were deemed as having probable PTSD diagnosis. Mediation analysis showed a significant chain-mediating effect of anxiety and sleep quality on the relationships between risk perceptions and PTSD symptoms; higher risk perceptions were related to increased anxiety, worsened sleep quality, and severe PTSD symptoms. Conclusively, medical staff have a high prevalence of PTSD symptoms after 3 months of COVID-19. Their PTSD symptoms were associated with the perceived risk level through the potential links with anxiety and sleep quality. Therefore, risk perception could be critical for our medical staff's responses to public health emergencies.

We retrospectively studied whether the admission serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) can serve as nearly predictor of disease severity during COVID-19 infection in comparison with other hematologic and inflammatory markers. Methods We included all consecutive patients who were admitted in Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco, between February to April 2020, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection using SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid via RT-PCR. The complete blood count and serum CRP level were routinely measured on admission. All clinical and laboratory data of patients were collected and analyzed. The classification of the disease severity was in accordance with the clinical classification of the WHO interim guidance, and the management of patients were adapted to the national management guideline. We estimated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of blood routine parameters as well as their association with COVID-19 disease severity. Results 145 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. The median age (range) was 50 (32-63) years, and 75 (51.7%) were men. 101 patients were classified in the non-severe group and 44 patients in the severe group. Based on disease severity, significant differences were observed in the age, gender, comorbidities, and respiratory symptom. Similarly, the biological analysis found significant differences for the neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and CRP level. However, according to ROC curves of these laboratory biomarkers, the AUC of CRP at 0.872 was significantly higher than all other parameters. Further, CRP was independently associated with severity of COVID-19 disease (OR = 1.11, 95% IC (1.01-1.22) and or = 1.13, 95% IC (1.04-1.23)).

METHODS The Teen Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study (NCT00474318) prospectively collected data on 242 adolescents undergoing MBS at 5 centers over a 3-year follow-up. Joint pain and physical function outcomes were assessed by using the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Kids, and the Short Form 36 Health Survey. Adolescents with Blount disease (n = 9) were excluded. RESULTS Prevalent musculoskeletal and LE pain were reduced by 40% within 12 months and persisted over 3 years. Adjusted models revealed a 6% lower odds of having musculoskeletal pain (odds ratio = 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.99) and a 10% lower odds of having LE pain (odds ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.86-0.95) per 10% reduction of BMI. The prevalence of poor physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score >0) declined from 49% to <20% at 6 months (P < .05), Physical comfort and the physical component scores, measured by the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life - Kids and the Short Form 36 Health Survey, improved at 6 months postsurgery and beyond (P < .01). Poor physical function predicted persistent joint pain after MBS. CONCLUSIONS Joint pain, impaired physical function, and impaired health-related quality of life significantly improve after MBS.

SERT BPND maps in nine a priori defined ROIs exhibiting high SERT binding were compared between groups by means of a linear mixed model. Finally, adopted from structural and functional connectivity analyses, we performed correlational analyses using regional SERT binding potentials to examine molecular interregional associations between all selected ROIs. We observed significant differences in the interregional correlations between the precuneus and the hippocampus in patients with ADHD compared to healthy controls, using SERT BPND of the investigated ROIs (P < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected). When correlating SERT BPND and age in the ADHD and the healthy control group, we confirmed an age-related decline in brain SERT binding in the thalamus and insula (R2 = 0.284, R2 = 0.167, Ps < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected). The results show significantly different interregional molecular associations of the SERT expression for the precuneus with hippocampus in patients with ADHD, indicating presumably altered functional coupling.

This work provides a one-step green synthetic approach to prepare iodine fibrous adsorbents without any chemical initiators or large amount of organic solvent. The original and modified PE/PP fibers were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric (TG) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to demonstrate the grafting of NVP onto the PE/PP fibers. The capacity of iodine absorbed by the PE/PP-g-PNVP fibers was 1237.8 mg/g after 180 min. Meanwhile, absorbents can be regenerated efficiently by two different means of ethanol elution and heating at 120 C, respectively. Within 10 min, 94.17% and 90.12% of the iodine can be released from the PE/PP-g-PNVP fibers with these two methods, respectively.

Mothers were surveyed by telephone regarding predelivery feeding plans, in-hospital feeding, and home feeding of their neonates. Any change prompted an additional question to determine whether this change was due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Of the 160 mother-newborn dyads, 103 mothers were reached by telephone, and 85 consented to participate. There was no significant difference in the predelivery feeding plan between the separated and unseparated dyads (P = .268). Higher rates of breastfeeding were observed in the unseparated dyads compared with the separated dyads both in the hospital (P < .001) and at home (P = .012).

Some of those apps leverage attenuation of Bluetooth beacons from mobile devices to build a record of proximate encounters between a pair of device owners. The underlying protocols are known to suffer from false positive and re-identification attacks. We present evidence that the attacker's difficulty in mounting such attacks has been overestimated. Indeed, an attacker leveraging a moderately successful app or SDK with Bluetooth and location access can eavesdrop and interfere with these proximity tracing systems at no hardware cost and perform these attacks against users who do not have this app or SDK installed. We describe concrete examples of actors who would be in a good position to execute such attacks. We further present a novel attack, which we call a biosurveillance attack, which allows the attacker to monitor the exposure risk of a smartphone user who installs their app or SDK but who does not use any contact tracing system and may falsely believe that they have opted out of the system. Through traffic auditing with an instrumented testbed, we characterize precisely the behaviour of one such SDK that we found in a handful of apps---but installed on more than one hundred million mobile devices. Its behaviour is functionally indistinguishable from a re-identification or biosurveillance attack and capable of executing a false positive attack with minimal effort. We also discuss how easily an attacker could acquire a position conducive to such attacks, by leveraging the lax logic for granting permissions to apps in the Android framework: any app with some geolocation permission could acquire the necessary Bluetooth permission through an upgrade, without any additional user prompt.

A disciplinary challenge remains to map the variability in person-centred care with an aim to empirically clarify the invariant in person-centred care. Based on current research and practice, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, this article argues that the relational aspect of person-centred care is such an invariant, building on the socially constructive notion of personhood being a standing or status that is bestowed on one human being by another in the context of relationship and social being. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, several of the key determinants of person-centred care are under threat due to health service responses and/or infection control measures, such as keeping older adults safe, imposing relationship restrictions, social distancing and isolation (or the lack thereof). Clinical examples from an Australian health service are used to show how recognizing the relational invariant of person-centred aged care facilitated supporting lives lived whilst also protecting lives saved. The relational invariant to person-centred care is who we are, constructed or deconstructed by and with others; something that may have become more visible through the relational restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. Protecting relationality in life and care and advocating for both safe and person-centred care for those who need it most is now more important than ever.","output":"Supporting lives lived whilst protecting lives saved during COVID-19: The relational invariant in person-centred care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is the first and most challenging health condition in the 21st century The number of patients confirmed with COVID-19 disease worldwide is now above one million, and the number of deaths is increasing day by day Bronchoscopy is a procedure used for the diagnosis and treatment of various conditions, but it can also transmit disease if appropriate precautions are not followed In this short review, the limited scientific knowledge about bronchoscopy in COVID-19 pneumonia and the precautions which should be performed are summarized","output":"Bronchoscopy and respiratory specimen collection for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Allium sativum L., also known as garlic, is a perennial plant widely used as a spice and also considered a medicinal herb since antiquity.

Containment measures have been applied to avoid contagion and reduce the patient infection rate. In this manuscript, we report the experience of the Pathology Department of the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori in Milan, during the period of the first lockdown that occurred in Lombardy from March to May 2020, focusing on the variation in terms of exams between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods and describing the measures applied to guarantee the safeguarding of workers. Moreover, we calculated if changes introduced within the workflow affected the average diagnosis time using Turn-Around-Time (TAT) metrics released by the Lombardy Region. We showed a sharp slowdown in exams during the first wave of COVID-19 and that the measures applied for the safeguarding of the personnel turned out to be feasible and did not affect the overall performance of the Pathology Department. ABSTRACT: Background: On December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. This disease, characterized by the rapid human-to-human transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly in more than 200 countries. Northern Italys regions have been hit hard in terms of deaths. Here, we report the experience of the Pathology Department of the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale Tumori (INT) in Milan, the first Italian public cancer center, in the period of the lockdown that took place in Lombardy from March to May 2020. Method: The variation in terms of exams was calculated in two different timeframes: December 2019CFebruary 2020 (pre-COVID-19) and MarchCMay 2020 (COVID-19). During these periods, Turn-Around-Time (TAT) metrics released by the Lombardy Region were calculated to assess if changes applied to guarantee the safeguarding of workers affected the average diagnosis time. Results: In the COVID-19 period, there was a decrease for all the performed exams. The most considerable decrease was observed for PAP tests (?81.6%), followed by biopsies (?48.8%), second opinions (?41.7%), and surgical (?31.5%), molecular (?29.4%) and cytological (?18.1%) tests. Measures applied within the Pathology Department, such as digital pathology, remote working, rotations and changes in operating procedures, improved the diagnostic performance as required by the guidelines of the Lombardy Region in terms of TAT. At the same time, the measures applied for the safeguarding of the personnel turned out to be feasible and did not affect the overall performance of the Pathology Department. Conclusions: The sharp slowdown in cancer screening during the first wave of COVID-19 could seriously endanger cancer prevention in the near future.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: Huge Stress Test for Health System Could Be a Great Opportunity to Update the Workflow in a Modern Surgical Pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 became a serious concern worldwide in summer 2021. We examined the copy number and variant types of all SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who visited our hospital from February to August 2021 using PCR tests. Whole genome sequencing was performed for some samples. The R.1 variant (B.1.1.316) was responsible for most infections in March, replacing the previous variant (B.1.1.214); the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant caused most infections in April and May; and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was the most prevalent in July and August. There was no significant difference in copy numbers among the previous variant cases (n=29, median 3.0x104 copies/L), R.1 variant cases (n=28, 2.1x105 copies/L), Alpha variant cases (n=125, 4.1x105 copies/L), and Delta variant cases (n=106, 2.4x105 copies/L). Patients with Delta variant infection were significantly younger than those infected with R.1 and the previous variants, possibly because many elderly individuals in Tokyo were vaccinated between May and August. There was no significant difference in mortality among the four groups. Our results suggest that the increased infectivity of Delta variant may be caused by factors other than the higher viral loads.

Melatonin was infused at 0.5 mg/kg in five neonates with HIE undergoing hypothermia. Infusion started 1 hour after the neonates reached the target temperature of 33.5C. Blood samples were collected before and at selective times after melatonin infusion. Abdominal complications or clinically significant changes in patients' vital signs were not found during or after melatonin. The peak plasma concentration reached 0.25 g/mL. The area under the curve in 24 hours was 4.35 g/mL*h. DISCUSSION Melatonin half-life and clearance were prolonged, and the distribution volume decreased compared to adults. In silico simulation estimated that the steady state can be reached after four infusions. Hypothermia does not affect melatonin PK. In humans high blood concentrations with lower doses can be achieved compared to animal experimentation, although intravenous administration is advised in the neonate population.

There are many therapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but there is no effective vaccine or therapy for treatment thus far. After affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling of host cells plays critical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant to identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells, and drugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially effective for COVID-19 treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify these potential molecular signaling pathways, and repurpose existing drugs as a potentially effective treatment of COVID-19 to facilitate the therapeutic discovery, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. We first identified dysfunctional signaling pathways associated with the infection caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through analysis of the altered gene expression profiles. In addition to the signaling pathway analysis, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super gene ontologies were identified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT, IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularly identified. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set of potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and reverse gene expression data resources. The dexamethasone was top-ranked in the prediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantly reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support.

The startup business seems to be the new prima donna in the business industry. Almost every year, maybe even every month there are many startup businesses of various types and circles in the technology field. At least until now there are thousands of local startups in Indonesia.Modalku is a financial technology (startup) company engaged in peer-to-peer lending and based in DKI Jakarta, Indonesia. Modalku is an online-based peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform that brings together SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) who need capital and are creditworthy with lenders who want to find investment alternatives. Under the auspices of PT. Mitrausaha Indonesia Group, Modalku provides money loan distribution services based on financial information technology (Fintech). As a platform, Modalku acts as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders. Of course, not only as an intermediary, Modalku also manages and channels funds from lenders who act as investors to SMEs who need business capital.The COVID-19 outbreak has had a serious impact on almost all countries in the world, including Indonesia. The impact is not only in one area, but in almost all existing activities. One aspect of concern in the midst of the Coronavirus outbreak is investment. The existence of various restrictions in a country certainly has an impact on economic activity. As is well known, the COVID-19 condition has affected several MSME business sectors, including several MSMEs who have become borrowers in Modalku.A peer to peer (P2P) lending technology (fintech) company, Modalku, applies a number of responsible lending principles as a risk mitigation measure from the impact of the corona virus (COVID-19). Co-Founder & CEO of Modalku, Reynold Wijaya, said that this principle is the principle of Modalku's operation in assessing MSME borrowers and their financial ability to repay loans. Reynold said, the business growth strategy in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak was very focused on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and their networks. There are 3 steps that will be implemented in the future. First, Modalku will carry out a more comprehensive selection process for prospective borrowers and MSMEs who have become borrowers at Modalku. Second, Modalku will react more quickly to changes in macroeconomic conditions by adjusting the limit as well as the loan period (tenor). The loan limit and tenor figures will be adjusted to the type of loan and the business profile of each MSME. Adjustments will be made on a case by case basis. Third, his party will maximize collaboration with e-commerce platforms, where most of the sellers are in the micro segment. He said, in the current condition of the importance of physical distancing, business transactions through e-commerce can develop well because people will tend to choose online shopping to meet basic needs and medicines.

In contrast to banks which basically use their own funds to provide loans to borrowers, Modalku gives many investors the freedom to choose any business they want and invest in as much business as possible for a relatively small amount of money. Modalku has funded more than 45 activity loans, totaling more than US $ 900 000 and the amount is still growing. Small and Medium Businesses have become the backbone for the Indonesian Economy and of course this business model will greatly encourage Indonesia's economic growth.

However, these influences have not been clarified in clinical settings. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate association the between the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) and concomitant use of antibiotics in a real-world population of warfarin users. Methods: This was a single-center cohort study using data from health records and included patients who received ?-lactams (BLs)/fluoroquinolones (FQs) during ongoing warfarin treatment (2011-2015) at Hamamatsu University Hospital in Japan. Antibiotics were categorized into those to which B fragilis is susceptible (BLsus, FQsus) and those to which it is not (BLnon, FQnon) and into those given orally (BLpo, FQpo) or intravenously (BLiv, FQiv). Outcomes were excessive PT-INR and changes in PT-INR, defined as the ratio (INR ratio) and difference (&#916;INR) of maximum PT-INR and baseline PT-INR. Excessive PT-INR was graded as INR ratio of >1.5 or >2.5. Results: A total of 1185 warfarin users were included. The proportion of INR ratio >2.5 in FQiv was higher than in BLiv (95% CI: 1.59-46.5). The proportions with an INR ratio of >1.5 in BLsus and FQsus were higher than in BLnon (1.72-14.1) and FQnon (1.05-9.36), respectively. &#916;INR values in FQpo, FQiv, and FQsus were higher than those in BLpo, BLiv, and FQnon, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Concomitant use of FQs, or of antibiotics to which B fragilis is susceptible is associated with higher risk of excessive anticoagulation.

Results The overall rate of medication dispensing errors was 24.6% (n = 37,009/150,442), of which 11.5% (n = 17,352/150,442) were prescription related errors and 13.1% (n = 19,657/150,442) pharmacist counselling errors. The most common type of prescription-related errors were wrong quantity (37.9%, n = 6584/17,352), whereas the most common pharmacist counselling error was wrong drug (41.9%, n = 8241/19,657). The majority of errors were caused by poor handwriting (30.7%, n = 75,651/37,009), followed by high workload (17.3%, n = 22,964/37,009). More than half of errors (52.6%) were moderate in severity, followed by minor errors (38.8%), and 8.6% of errors were rated as serious. Predictors of medication dispensing errors were: Sundays (OR 2.7; 95% CI 2.15-3.94; p = 0.02), grade A pharmacies (dispensing &#8805; 60 prescriptions a day (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.89-4.78; p = 0.04)), and prescriptions containing &#8805; 4 medication orders (OR 4.1; 95% CI 2.9-6.4; p = 0.001).

We analysed donor turnout during the COVID-19 period descriptively and using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 7122 people that responded to the survey, 1205 (169%) blood donors were identified, with 338% donating during the first 4-5 months of the COVID-19 period. We observed that around half of donors donated less than normal. The vast majority of donors that did donate made a special effort to do so in response to COVID-19. The majority of donors were also not aware of their blood being tested for COVID-19 antibodies. Although the perceived risk of infection among all respondents whilst donating blood was relatively low, those who anticipated a high risk of infection were much less likely to donate (OR = 0540; P-value = 0006). Furthermore, those that were adherent to COVID guidelines were also less likely to donate (OR = 0583; P-value = 0000).

Here we characterize the evolutionary processes underlying the emergence of CPV. Although FPLV has remained an endemic infection in its host populations, we show that, since the 1970s, the newly emerged CPV has undergone an epidemic-like pattern of logistic/exponential growth, effectively doubling its population size every few years. This rapid population growth was associated with a lineage of CPV that acquired a broader host range and greater infectivity. Recombination played no role in the emergence of CPV. Rather, any preexisting variation in the donor species and the subsequent rapid adaptation of the virus to canines were likely dependent on a high rate of mutation and the positive selection of mutations in the major capsid gene.

For the first time at our dental school, theoretical knowledge was imparted to students via asynchronous online screencasts and discussed via synchronous video meetings only. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of distance education as a new teaching format for theoretical knowledge within the preclinical course in Operative Dentistry (sixth semester of the undergraduate dental curriculum in Germany). METHODS: The phantom course comprised distance education (first phase, 11 weeks) and subsequent on-site practical demonstrations and training (second phase, 10 weeks). All theoretical knowledge was taught via online screencasts during distance education (except for the first week, 3 screencasts were uploaded per week resulting in a total of 30 screencasts). Until the end of the term, all students (N=33) were able to view the screencasts for an unlimited number of times. Theoretical knowledge was assessed in a summative examination after practical on-site teaching. Acceptance and effectiveness of the new curriculum and distance education were also measured based on an evaluation survey and students' self-perceived learning outcome, which was compared to the outcome from the two pre-COVID-19 terms. RESULTS: Each screencast was viewed by a mean of 24 (SD 3.3) students and accessed a mean of 5.6 (SD 1.2) times per user (ie, by students who accessed the respective screencast at least once). During distance education, the number of accesses showed a linear trend over time. During the practical training phase, screencast views declined and increased again prior to the examination. Screencasts covering topics in Cariology, Restorative Dentistry, and Preventive Dentistry were viewed by more students than screencasts covering topics in Endodontology or Periodontology (both P=.047). Examination items in Periodontology showed inferior results compared to the other topics (P<.001). Within the different topics, students' self-perceived learning outcome did not differ from that during the pre-COVID-19 terms.

Remarkably, upon infection of Vero cells, but not of BHK-21 or RK-13 cells, EAV nsp2 is now shown to be subject to an additional, internal, cleavage. In Vero cells, approximately 50% of nsp2 (61 kDa) was cleaved into an 18 kDa N-terminal part and a 44 kDa C-terminal part, most likely by a host cell protease that is absent in BHK-21 and RK-13 cells. Although the functional consequences of this additional processing step are unknown, the experiments in Vero cells revealed that the C-terminal part of nsp2 interacts with nsp3. Most EAV nsps localize to virus-induced double-membrane structures in the perinuclear region of the infected cell, where virus RNA synthesis takes place. It is now shown that, in an expression system, the co-expression of nsp2 and nsp3 is both necessary and sufficient to induce the formation of double-membrane structures that strikingly resemble those found in infected cells.

We also performed in silico saturation mutagenesis of the S-protein ACE2 interface and identified a further 38 potential missense mutations that could strongly inhibit binding and one more that is likely to enhance binding (Thr27Arg). A conservative estimate places the prevalence of the strongly protective variants between 12-70 per 100,000 population but there is the possibility of higher prevalence in local populations or those underrepresented in gnomAD. The probable interplay between these ACE2 affinity variants and ACE2 expression polymorphisms is highlighted as well as gender differences in penetrance arising from ACE2s situation on the X-chromosome. It is also described how our data can help power future genetic association studies of COVID-19 phenotypes and how the saturation mutant predictions can help design a mutant ACE2 with tailored S-protein affinity, which may be an improvement over a current recombinant ACE2 that is undergoing clinical trial. Key results 1 ACE2 gnomAD missense variant (p.Gly326Glu) and one unobserved missense mutation (Thr27Arg) are predicted to enhance ACE2 binding with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which could result in increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 3 ACE2 missense variants in gnomAD plus another 38 unobserved missense mutations are predicted to inhibit Spike binding, these are expected to confer a high degree of resistance to infection The prevalence of the strongly protective variants is estimated between 12-70 per 100,000 population but higher prevalence may exist in local populations or those underrepresented in gnomAD A strategy to design a recombinant ACE2 with tailored affinity towards Spike and its potential therapeutic value is presented The predictions were extensively validated against published ACE2 mutant binding assays for SARS-CoV Spike protein","output":"Missense variants in ACE2 are predicted to encourage and inhibit interaction with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and contribute to genetic risk in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the pace of the dissemination of scientific information has increased In this context, the possibility and value of sharing open access (OA) online manuscripts in their preprint form seem to be growing in many scientific fields More and more platforms are especially dedicated to free preprint publishing They are published, non-peer-reviewed scholarly papers that typically precede publication in a peer-reviewed journal They have been a part of science since at least the 1960s In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web to help researchers share knowledge easily A few months later, in August 1991, as a centralized web-based network, arXiv was created arXiv is arguably the most influential preprint platform and has supported the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science for over 30 years Since, preprint platforms have become popular in many disciplines (e g , bioRxiv for biological sciences) due to the increasing drive towards OA publishing, and can be publisher- or community-driven, profit or not for profit, and based on proprietary or free and open source software A range of discipline-specific or cross-domain platforms now exist, with exponential growth these last five years While preprints as a whole still represent only a small proportion of scholarly publishing, a strong community of early adopters is already beginning to experiment with such value-enhancing tools in many more disciplines than before The two main options for geochemists are EarthArXiv and ESSOAr A one size fits all model for preprints would never work across the entire scientific community The geochemistry community needs to develop and sustain their own model","output":"On the Potential of Preprints in Geochemistry: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy is a major threat to public health. While the root causes of vaccine hesitancy are numerous, they largely revolve around some form of perceived risk to the self. In particular, the unknown long-term risks are amongst the most frequently cited concerns. In this work, we show that regardless of their peak onset following vaccination, the incidence of adverse outcomes will follow some distribution $f(x ; | ; mu, sigma^2)$ of mean onset $mu$, and standard deviation $sigma$, and variance $sigma^2$. Despite the small proportion of events at the tails of these distributions, the large-scale public deployment of vaccines would imply that any signal for a given adverse outcome would be observed soon after distribution begins, even in cases where $t_x< t_{mu-3sigma}$. The absence of such an early signal, however low, would suggest that long term effects are unlikely and that vaccine safety is therefore likely. Indeed, when enough individuals have been exposed to a new therapy - even if the majority of adverse outcomes only manifest at a future time $t_mu$, the number of adverse outcomes given by the cumulative density function (CDF) near $t_0 + dt $ $>$ 0.

In our recently published work and this study, by clarifying the vertical transmission mechanism of Rice stripe virus (RSV) in Laodelphax striatellus, we provide a novel paradigm for how arboviruses enter insect germ-line cells. Instead of direct interaction with a viral receptor, the virus binds to a secreted ligand protein, hitchhiking the ligand-receptor pathway to achieve cell entry. Vitellogenin (Vg) is an indispensable protein for embryo development that is synthesized extra-ovarially and taken up by germ-line cells through Vg receptor (VgR)-mediated endocytosis. After revealing that RSV invades L. striatellus ovary by a specific molecular interaction with the insect Vg in haemolymph, this study addressed VgR's function in mediating the RSV invasion of the germarium nurse cells, further confirming the ligand's receptor-mediated viral cell-invasion mechanism.

The authors have therefore used the craniotomy box in an innovative way to enable a safe alternative for skull and brain removal procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 bodies. The craniotomy box technique was tested on a confirmed COVID-19 positive body where a full postmortem examination was performed by a team of highly trained personnel in a negative pressure Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) autopsy suite in the National Institute of Forensic Medicine (IPFN) Malaysia. This craniotomy box is a custom-made transparent plastic box with five walls but without a floor. Two circular holes were made in one wall for the placement of arms in order to perform the skull opening procedure. A swab to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was taken from the interior surface of the craniotomy box after the procedure. The result from the test using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) proved that an additional barrier provided respiratory protection by containing the aerosols generated from the skull opening procedure.

The method used in the research is content analysis which analyzes news in media that shows the topic related to COVID-19 and tourism. In contrast to previous studies, the decline in the number of tourists was due to the reach of tourist attractions, facilities, access, and costs. This study tries to look in more detail about how the COVID-19 pandemic has a serious impact on the tourism sector. As a result, the number of foreign tourist visits or foreign tourists to Indonesia has decreased in 2020 by 28.85% compared to the number of visits in 2019.

Upon activation by viral double-stranded RNA, OAS synthesizes (2-5) oligoadenylates, which activate RNase L, leading to the nonspecific degradation of cellular and viral RNA. Some association studies in humans suggest that variation at one of the OAS genes, OAS1, could be influencing host susceptibility to viral infection. We assessed the diversity of OAS1 in hominoid primates with a focus on chimpanzees. We found that the OAS1 gene is extremely polymorphic in Central African chimpanzee and exhibits levels of silent and replacement diversity much higher than neutral regions of the chimpanzee genome. This level of variation strongly suggests that balancing selection is acting on OAS1, and indeed, this conclusion was validated by several tests of neutrality. We further demonstrated that balancing selection has been acting at this locus since the split between chimpanzees, humans, and gorillas (~8.6 Ma) and caused the persistence of two deeply divergent allelic lineages in Central African chimpanzees. These two groups of OAS1 alleles differ by a large number of amino acids (a.a.), including several a.a. putatively involved in RNA binding. It is therefore very likely that variation at the OAS1 locus affects the innate immune response of individuals to specific viral infection. Our data strongly suggest that interactions between viral RNA and OAS1 are responsible for the maintenance of ancestral polymorphisms at this locus for at least 13.2 My.","output":"Long-term balancing selection at the antiviral gene OAS1 in Central African chimpanzees."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose We investigated the effect of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) on life-threatening COVID-19; presenting as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) plus multi-system organ failure and cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Outcomes of interest were thoughts of suicide or self-harm as measured through the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression and help-seeking behaviours. RESULTS Overall, 819 (10.5%) of 7795 healthcare workers reported thoughts of suicide or self-harm over a 2-week period. Healthcare workers with these thoughts experienced higher rates of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and burnout than their peers. In multivariable models, the odds of suicide or self-harm thoughts were higher among workers who had friends or family infected with COVID-19 (odds ratio = 1.24, 95% confidence interval = [1.06, 1.47]), were living alone (odds ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval = [1.06, 1.64]), younger (?30 years cf. >50 years; odds ratio = 1.70, 95% confidence interval = 1.36-2.13), male (odds ratio = 1.81, 95% confidence interval = [1.49, 2.20]), had increased alcohol use (odds ratio = 1.58, 95% confidence interval = [1.35, 1.86]), poor physical health (odds ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval = [1.36, 1.92]), increased income worries (odds ratio = 1.81, 95% confidence interval = [1.54, 2.12]) or prior mental illness (odds ratio = 3.27, 95% confidence interval = [2.80, 3.82]). Having dependent children was protective (odds ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval = [0.61, 0.92]).

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants show increased infectivity and may lead to resistance against immune responses of previously immunized individuals or existing therapeutics, especially antibody-based therapies. Several monoclonal antibody therapeutics authorized for emergency use or in development have been shown to lose potency against some SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cocktails of two different monoclonal antibodies constitute a promising approach to protect against novel emerging variants as long as both antibodies are potent, but come with increased development complexity and therefore cost. As an alternative, we developed two multispecific DARPin? therapeutics, each combining three independent DARPin? domains binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in one molecule, to potently neutralize the virus and overcome virus escape. Here, we show in a panel of in vitro studies that the multispecific DARPin? therapeutic design incorporated in our clinical candidate ensovibep (MP0420), achieved high neutralization potencies against the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK variant), B.1.351 (South African variant), P.1 (Brazilian variant), B.1.429 (South Californian variant), B.1.526 (New York variant), R.1 (Japanese variant), A.23.1 (Ugandan variant), and B.1.617 (Indian variant), and there is strong evidence that ensovibep also potently neutralizes the Indian variant B.1.618 based on the analysis of the key point mutations in the spike protein of this variant. Additionally, viral passaging experiments show potent protection by ensovibep and MP0423 against development of escape mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that the cooperative binding of the individual modules in a multispecific DARPin? antiviral is key for potent virus inhibition and protection from escape variants. These results, combined with the relatively small size and high production yields of DARPin? molecules, suggest that ensovibep is a highly valuable alternative to monoclonal antibody cocktails for global supply and demonstrate the strength of the DARPin? platform for achieving potent and lasting virus inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses.","output":"Multispecific DARPin? therapeutics demonstrate very high potency against SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liming Li and colleagues highlight the importance of identifying people without symptoms to control outbreaks of covid-19","output":"Role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections in covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 and measures to contain it may have impacted college students' behavior, including their drinking behavior. Students' drinking may have decreased-for example, due to the closure of bars-but problematic drinking may have increased-for example, due to (solitary) drinking at home. Another behavior that has increased due to COVID-19 and the accompanying social isolation is students' social networking site (SNS) use. This is worrisome because students' SNS use has been shown to increase their alcohol use. Nevertheless, little research has investigated these behaviors and the possible link between them during a lockdown. Therefore, this study aimed to examine (1) whether students engaged in drinking during a lockdown, (2) whether they displayed their drinking behavior on SNSs, and (3) whether exposure to and posting of alcohol-related content was linked to their daily alcohol use. METHODS: 337 college students (Mage = 20.63 years, SDage = 1.55 years; 50.3% male) participated in a two-week daily diary study. Descriptive statistical analyses and generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) were deployed. RESULTS: Descriptive analysis results showed that during the week, students' drinking occurred with friends in dormitories, while in the weekend, this behavior shifted to drinking with friends and parents at home. Moreover, students mostly saw visual and posted textual posts of this drinking on SNSs. Furthermore, GLMM revealed associations between exposure to alcohol postings, sharing of alcohol postings, and students' probability of drinking on the same day.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 30 to April 30, 2020 at two hospitals in New York City. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed using cycle threshold (Ct) values from a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay applied to nasopharyngeal swab samples. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes among patients with high, medium, and low admission viral loads and assessed whether viral load was independently associated with risk of intubation and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We evaluated 678 patients with COVID-19. Higher viral load was associated with increased age, comorbidities, smoking status, and recent chemotherapy. In-hospital mortality was 35.0% with a high viral load (Ct<25; n=220), 17.6% with a medium viral load (Ct 25-30; n=216), and 6.2% with a low viral load (Ct>30; n=242; P<0.001). The risk of intubation was also higher in patients with a high viral load (29.1%), compared to those with a medium (20.8%) or low viral load (14.9%; P<0.001). High viral load was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.92-12.52; P<0.001) and intubation (aOR 2.73; 95% CI: 1.68-4.44; P<0.001) in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: Admission SARS-CoV-2 viral load among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 independently correlates with the risk of intubation and in-hospital mortality. Providing this information to clinicians could potentially be used to guide patient care.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load on Risk of Intubation and Mortality Among Hospitalized Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dry eye disease (DED) is a complex, progressive and multifactorial condition that is commonly seen in clinical practice and can be challenging to accurately diagnose. Untreated or suboptimally managed dry eye can progress to severe, chronic disease which may become resistant to treatment. Symptoms include ocular irritation and visual impairment. Patients frequently report negative consequences regarding quality of life (QoL), productivity and psychological wellbeing. Certain lifestyle factors (e.g. use of screen-based devices, air conditioning) can induce or exacerbate symptoms of DED, leading to progressive and debilitating complications. Exposures to such triggers are likely to have increased significantly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with people across the globe living with heightened levels of stress/anxiety while being forced to adapt most aspects of their daily lives (from work and education through to social activities) to accommodate social distancing, primarily through the use digital technologies. This review aims to provide a concise and practical overview of current understanding regarding DED, highlighting proposals for refined diagnostic categories and therapeutic terminologies that are designed to improve identification and management of dry eye as well as reduce or slow disease progression. Finally, the findings of a European survey are shared to illustrate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of people with DED. The survey was conducted during the first lockdown period (MarchCSeptember 2020) and explored issues relating to psychological wellbeing, QoL and engagement with healthcare services. The results demonstrate the ways in which the pandemic amplified the impact of dry eye on daily life and may be valuable in enhancing understanding among clinicians of the challenges faced by people with DED, which extend beyond the signs and symptoms of disease.","output":"A Narrative Review of Current Understanding and Classification of Dry Eye Disease with New Insights on the Impact of Dry Eye during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] At present, the most powerful new drugs for COVID-19 are antibody proteins. In addition, there are some star small molecule drugs. However, there are few studies on nanomaterials. Here, we study the intact graphene (IG), defective graphene (DG), and graphene oxide (GO) interacting with COVID-19 protein. We find that they show progressive inhibition of COVID-19 protein. By using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 3CL M(pro) and graphene-related materials (GRMs): IG, DG, and GO. The results show that M(pro) can be absorbed onto the surfaces of investigated materials. DG and GO interacted with M(pro) more intensely, causing the decisive part of M(pro) to become more flexible. Further analysis shows that compared to IG and GO, DG can inactivate M(pro) and inhibit its expression effectively by destroying the active pocket of M(pro).

These receptors participate in various physiologic pathways such as metabolism, growth, immune responses, inflammation, vision, taste, olfaction, neurotransmission and even and pathologic responses including chronic inflammatory and vascular diseases. Receptors contributing to the biological responses of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are members of GPCR family. COVID-19-induced inflammatory cascade has been attributed to acute ACE2 downregulation and imbalance of proinflammatory ACE/AngII/AT1R and anti-inflammatory ACE2/angiotensin (1-7)/Mas axes in favor of the former.

It is notable that these receptors induce their effects both through G protein and -arrestin pathway;the former exerts temporary and the latter more sustained effects. In addition to the imbalance of GPCR responses contributing to RAS activities, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis might be attributed to the activation of GPCRs or modulating G-proteins involved in adenosine-CFTR regulation system and epithelial Na channel function.This article includes a minireview about the physiological functions of GPCRs and their contribution to COVID-19.","output":"GPCRs of Diverse Physiologic and Pathologic Effects with Fingerprints in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In this study, a report of dietitian-led nutrition interventions for patients with COVID-19 during ICU and ward-based rehabilitation is provided. As knowledge of COVID-19 and its medical treatments evolved through the course of the pandemic, dietetic-led interventions were compared between surge 1 (S1) and surge 2 (S2). Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted of patients admitted to the ICU service in a large academic hospital (London, UK). Clinical and nutrition data were collected during the first surge (MarchCJune 2020; n = 200) and the second surge (November 2020CMarch 2021; n = 253) of COVID-19. Results: A total of 453 patients were recruited. All required individualized dietetic-led interventions during ICU admission as the ICU nutrition protocol did not meet nutritional needs. Feed adjustments for deranged renal function (p = 0.001) and propofol calories (p = 0.001) were more common in S1, whereas adjustment for gastrointestinal dysfunction was more common in S2 (p = 0.001). One-third of all patients were malnourished on ICU admission, and all lost weight in ICU, with a mean (SD) total percentage loss of 8.8% (6.9%).

Independent head-to-head studies are necessary for SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT nasal sampling to demonstrate comparability of performance with nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling. We conducted a head-to-head comparison study of a supervised, self-collected nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab and a professional-collected NP swab, using the Panbio? Ag-RDT (distributed by Abbott). We calculated positive and negative percent agreement between the sampling methods as well as sensitivity and specificity for both sampling techniques compared to the reference standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A SARS-CoV-2 infection could be diagnosed by RT-PCR in 45 of 290 participants (15.5%). Comparing the NMT and NP sampling the positive percent agreement of the Ag-RDT was 88.1% (37/42 PCR positives detected; CI 75.0C94.8%). The negative percent agreement was 98.8% (245/248; CI 96.5C99.6%). The overall sensitivity of Panbio with NMT sampling was 84.4% (38/45; CI 71.2C92.3%) and 88.9% (40/45; CI 76.5C95.5%) with NP sampling. Specificity was 99.2% (243/245; CI 97.1C99.8%) for both, NP and NMT sampling. The sensitivity of the Panbio test in participants with high viral load (> 7 log(10) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/mL) was 96.3% (CI 81.7C99.8%) for both, NMT and NP sampling.

However, rigorous efficacy testing requires extensive screening with live virus under onerous biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions, which limits high-throughput screening of patient and vaccine sera. Myriad BSL2-compatible surrogate virus neutralization assays (VNAs) have been developed to overcome this barrier. Yet, there is marked variability between VNAs and how their results are presented, making intergroup comparisons difficult. To address these limitations, we developed a standardized VNA using CoV2-S pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp) based on vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the Renilla luciferase gene in place of its G glycoprotein (VSV&#916;G); this assay can be robustly produced at scale and generate accurate neutralizing titers within 18 h postinfection. Our standardized CoV2pp VNA showed a strong positive correlation with CoV2-S enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results and live-virus neutralizations in confirmed convalescent-patient sera. Three independent groups subsequently validated our standardized CoV2pp VNA (n > 120). Our data (i) show that absolute 50% inhibitory concentration (absIC50), absIC80, and absIC90 values can be legitimately compared across diverse cohorts, (ii) highlight the substantial but consistent variability in neutralization potency across these cohorts, and (iii) support the use of the absIC80 as a more meaningful metric for assessing the neutralization potency of a vaccine or convalescent-phase sera. Lastly, we used our CoV2pp in a screen to identify ultrapermissive 293T clones that stably express ACE2 or ACE2 plus TMPRSS2. When these are used in combination with our CoV2pp, we can produce CoV2pp sufficient for 150,000 standardized VNAs/week.IMPORTANCE Vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics like convalescent-phase plasma therapy are premised upon inducing or transferring neutralizing antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Virus neutralization assays (VNAs) for measuring neutralizing antibody titers (NATs) are an essential part of determining vaccine or therapeutic efficacy. However, such efficacy testing is limited by the inherent dangers of working with the live virus, which requires specialized high-level biocontainment facilities. We therefore developed a standardized replication-defective pseudotyped particle system that mimics the entry of live SARS-CoV-2. This tool allows for the safe and efficient measurement of NATs, determination of other forms of entry inhibition, and thorough investigation of virus entry mechanisms. Four independent labs across the globe validated our standardized VNA using diverse cohorts. We argue that a standardized and scalable assay is necessary for meaningful comparisons of the myriad of vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics becoming available. Our data provide generalizable metrics for assessing their efficacy.","output":"Quantifying Absolute Neutralization Titers against SARS-CoV-2 by a Standardized Virus Neutralization Assay Allows for Cross-Cohort Comparisons of COVID-19 Sera"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After renal transplantation, there is a need of immunosuppressive regimens that effectively prevent allograft rejection while minimizing cardiovascular complications. This substudy of the TRITON trial evaluated the cardiovascular effects of autologous bone marrowCderived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in renal transplant recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Renal transplant recipients were randomized to MSC therapy, infused at weeks 6 and 7 after transplantation, with withdrawal at week 8 of tacrolimus or standard tacrolimus dose. Fifty\\\\four patients (MSC group=27; control group=27) underwent transthoracic echocardiography at weeks 4 and 24 after transplantation and were included in this substudy. Changes in clinical and echocardiographic variables were compared. The MSC group showed a benefit in blood pressure control, assessed by a significant interaction between changes in diastolic blood pressure and the treatment group (P=0.005), and a higher proportion of patients achieving the predefined blood pressure target of <140/90 mm Hg compared with the control group (59.3% versus 29.6%, P=0.03). A significant reduction in left ventricular mass index was observed in the MSC group, whereas there were no changes in the control group (P=0.002). The proportion of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy decreased at 24 weeks in the MSC group (33.3% versus 70.4%, P=0.006), whereas no changes were noted in the control group (63.0% versus 48.1%, P=0.29). Additionally, MSC therapy prevented progressive left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, as demonstrated by changes in mitral deceleration time and tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity. CONCLUSIONS: MSC strategy is associated with improved blood pressure control, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and prevention of progressive diastolic dysfunction at 24 weeks after transplantation.

It has also had a tremendous impact on mental health, including fear and worry, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, and increased use of poor coping mechanisms. Osteopathic medical students have had additional concerns regarding the interruption of their studies, closing of clinical rotations, and postponed licensing exams. To date, few reports have focused on osteopathic medical students and their reactions to the outbreak. OBJECTIVES: To assess resilience, coping, health behaviors, and emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we distributed an anonymous online survey to all medical students enrolled at Nova Southeastern University in May 2020 (n=1,310) via an e-mail invitation using the institution's student listservs. Our major study variables were based on published reports and anecdotal evidence; we subsequently developed the Emotional Wellbeing in Healthcare Professions Students Questionnaire (EWB-Q). This EWB-Q contained validated scales to assess the contribution of levels of coping strategies used, personal resilience, and health behaviors on the emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students. Multiple linear regression and other statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v0.26. RESULTS: Of the 1,310 students invited to participate, 335 (25.5%) surveys were returned.

A significant regression equation was found (F[4,171]=17.481, p<0.000, R 2 =0.290, R 2adjusted=0.274), indicating that levels of coping, personal resilience, and health behaviors (i.e., not sleeping more than usual, not exercising less than usual) accounted for a significant amount of the variance in emotional wellbeing scores in osteopathic medical students. Higher levels of resilience, greater use of coping strategies, not sleeping more than usual, and not exercising less than usual were predictors of emotional wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Cultivating positive mental health should be a high priority for medical educators as they develop and implement curriculum-based initiatives to help medical students bolster their personal resilience and to encourage healthy coping behaviors during times of crisis and beyond. A proactive position that assists with building personal resilience and developing stress management habits is paramount in assisting students who are grappling not only with the challenges of rigorous medical training, but also with the uncertainty and stress that exists during any major global health or socioeconomic crisis.","output":"Predictors of emotional wellbeing in osteopathic medical students in a COVID-19 world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation: We are witnessing two phenomena. The first is that the physiotherapist is increasingly becoming a figure that must interact with Digital Health. On the other hand, social robots through research are improving more and more in the aspects of social interaction thanks also to artificial intelligence and becoming useful in rehabilitation processes. It begins to become strategic to investigate the intersections between these two phenomena. Objective: Therefore, we set ourselves the goal of investigating the consensus and opinion of physiotherapists around the introduction of social robots in clinical practice both in rehabilitation and assistance. Procedure: An electronic survey has been developed focused on social robot-based rehabilitation and assistance and has been submitted to subjects focused on physiotherapy sciences to investigate their opinion and their level of consent regarding the use of the social robot in rehabilitation and assistance. Two samples of subjects were recruited: the first group (156 participating subjects, 79 males, 77 females, mean age 24.3 years) was in the training phase, and the second (167 participating subjects, 86 males, 81 females, mean age 42.4 years) group was involved in the work processes. An electronic feedback form was also submitted to investigate the acceptance of the proposed methodology. Results: The survey showed a consistency of the results between the two samples from which interesting considerations emerge. Contrary to stereotypes that report how AI-based devices put jobs at risk, physiotherapists are not afraid of these devices. The subjects involved in the study believe the following: (a) social robots can be reliable co-workers but will remain a complementary device; (b) their role will be of the utmost importance as an operational manager in their use and in performance monitoring; (c) these devices will allow an increase in working capacity and facilitate integration. All those involved in the study believe that the proposed electronic survey has proved to be a useful and effective tool that can be useful as a periodic monitoring tool and useful for scientific societies. Conclusions: The evolution of social robots represents an unstoppable process as does the increase in the aging of the population. Stakeholders must not look with suspicion toward these devices, which can represent an important resource, but rather invest in monitoring and consensus training initiatives.","output":"The Social Robot and the Digital Physiotherapist: Are We Ready for the Team Play?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID19 was first reported in England at the end of January 2020, and by mid-June over 150,000 cases were reported. We assume that, similarly to influenza-like illnesses, people who suffer from COVID19 may query for their symptoms prior to accessing the medical system (or in lieu of it). Therefore, we analyzed searches to Bing from users in England, identifying cases where unexpected rises in relevant symptom searches occurred at specific areas of the country. Our analysis shows that searches for \\"fever\\" and \\"cough\\" were the most correlated with future case counts, with searches preceding case counts by 16-17 days. Unexpected rises in search patterns were predictive of future case counts multiplying by 2.5 or more within a week, reaching an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.64. Similar rises in mortality were predicted with an AUC of approximately 0.61 at a lead time of 3 weeks.

The CAD system processes chest X-ray data and provides accurate, objective imaging markers to assist in the determination of patients with a higher risk of death and thus are more likely to require mechanical ventilation and/or more intensive clinical care.To obtain an accurate stochastic model that has the ability to detect the severity of lung infection, we develop a second-order Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) invariant under rigid transformation (translation or rotation of the image) as well as scale (i.e., pixel size). The parameters of the MGRF model are learned automatically, given a training set of X-ray images with affected lung regions labeled. An X-ray input to the system undergoes pre-processing to correct for non-uniformity of illumination and to delimit the boundary of the lung, using either a fully-automated segmentation routine or manual delineation provided by the radiologist, prior to the diagnosis. The steps of the proposed methodology are: (i) estimate the Gibbs energy at several different radii to describe the inhomogeneity in lung infection; (ii) compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) as a new representation to describe the local inhomogeneity in the infected region of lung; and (iii) input the CDFs to a new neural network-based fusion system to determine whether the severity of lung infection is low or high. This approach is tested on 200 clinical X-rays from 200 COVID-19 positive patients, 100 of whom died and 100 who recovered using multiple training/testing processes including leave-one-subject-out (LOSO), tenfold, fourfold, and twofold cross-validation tests. The Gibbs energy for lung pathology was estimated at three concentric rings of increasing radii. The accuracy and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the system steadily improved as the radius increased. The overall CAD system combined the estimated Gibbs energy information from all radii and achieved a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and DSC of 100%, 97%  3%, 98%  2%, and 98%  2%, respectively, by twofold cross validation. Alternative classification algorithms, including support vector machine, random forest, naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbors, and decision trees all produced inferior results compared to the proposed neural network used in this CAD system. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system as a novel tool to objectively assess disease severity and predict mortality in COVID-19 patients.

To account for confounders, patients were substratified by whether they developed hypotension and acute kidney injury (AKI) during the index hospitalization. RESULTS: Mortality (22% vs 17%, P > .05) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (26% vs 12%, P > .05) rates were not significantly different between non-ACEi/ARB and ACEi/ARB groups.

We evaluated the correlation between ECGs findings and major adverse events (MAE) as the composite of intra\\\\hospital all\\\\cause mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Abnormal ECGs were defined if primary ST\\\\T segment alterations, left ventricular hypertrophy, tachy or bradyarrhythmias and any new AV, bundle blocks or significant morphology alterations (e.g., new Q pathological waves) were present. RESULTS: Abnormal ECG at admission (106/216) and elevated baseline troponin values were more common in patients who developed MAE (p = .04 and p = .02, respectively). Concerning ECGs recorded after 7 days (159), abnormal findings were reported in 53.5% of patients and they were more frequent in those with MAE (p = .001). Among abnormal ECGs, ischemic alterations and left ventricular hypertrophy were significantly associated with a higher MAE rate. The multivariable analysis showed that the presence of abnormal ECG at 7 days of hospitalization was an independent predictor of MAE (HR 3.2; 95% CI 1.2C8.7; p = .02).

This research examines the molecular response processes of FAW to low temperature (4C) and high temperature (40C) when gene expression is compared to controls (25C). A total of 211,967 unigenes were collected, at least 14,338 of which were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology terms, and metabolic pathways. There were 50 Gene Ontology (GO) functional sub-groups and 21 EggNOG words as a result. Differentially expresses genes (DEGs) with log2FC  2 were identified and compared at various temperatures.

Inhalation devices consist of nebulizers and handheld inhalers, such as dry-powder inhalers (DPIs), pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), and soft mist inhalers (SMIs). Although pMDIs, DPIs and SMIs may be appropriate for most patients with COPD, certain patient populations may have challenges with these devices. Patients who have cognitive, neuromuscular, or ventilatory impairments (and receive limited assistance from caregivers), as well as those with suboptimal peak inspiratory flow may not derive the full benefit from handheld inhalers. A considerable number of patients are not capable of producing a peak inspiratory flow rate to overcome the internal resistance of DPIs. Furthermore, patients may have difficulty coordinating inhalation with device actuation, which is required for pMDIs and SMIs. However, inhalation devices such as spacers and valved holding chambers can be used with pMDIs to increase the efficiency of aerosol delivery. Nebulized treatment provides patients with COPD an alternative administration route that avoids the need for inspiratory flow, manual dexterity, or complex hand-breath coordination.

METHODS: Ninety-two patients and 92 age- and gender-matched healthy controls received adjuvant-free influenza A/California/7/2009 (pH1N1) vaccine. Blood samples were collected immediately before and 3 weeks after vaccination to evaluate antibody responses to the H1N1 virus. Efficacy was assessed by seroprotection (SP) and seroconversion (SC) rates and the factor increase in geometric mean antibody titre. Participants received a 21-day symptom diary card and were instructed to report local and systemic adverse events. RESULTS: SSc patients were predominantly females (91%) and 61% had limited SSc, 12% had severe skin involvement and 57.6% were on immunosuppressive (IS) therapy. SSc patients and controls presented comparable overall SP (P = 0.20) and SC (P = 0.61) rates. Further evaluation of the possible effect of disease and therapy revealed similar rates of SP and SC in patients with dcSSc vs lcSSc (SP P = 0.62 and SC P = 0.66), severe vs mild/moderate skin involvement (SP P = 1 and SC P = 0.45) and with vs without IS (SP P = 0.26 and SC P = 0.10).

It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has migrated from bats to an intermediate host and then to humans. This article aims at the mechanism and management of prothrombotic state in COVID-19 positive patients. We tried to present how the SARS-CoV-2 virus can induce thromboembolic events and the incidence of these thromboembolic events. We also tried to depict anticoagulation management in these patients as well as postdischarge plan and follow-up. Invasion of type 2 pneumocytes by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is critical in the course of illness because it results in activation of immune cells leading to elevation of cytokines. The subsequent activation of T cells and macrophages infiltrates the infected myocardial cells causing direct myocardiocyte toxicity and development of arrhythmia. Hypoxia or hypotension during the clinical course causes a mismatch between myocyte oxygen supply and workload demand resulting in cardiac distress. SARS-CoV-2 affects endothelial cells and pericytes that lead to severe micro and macrovascular dysfunction, and together with oxygen supply-demand mismatch, immune hyperresponsivity can potentially cause destabilization and plaque rupture causing acute coronary syndromes. Other mechanisms of injury include myocarditis, pericarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, vasculitis, and DIC (Disseminated intravascular coagulation)/microthrombi. SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells by the Spike protein S whose surface unit, S1, binds to the ACE2 receptor on the host cell. The type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 and histone acetyltransferases (HAT) are host cell proteases that are recruited by the virus to cleave ACE2 surface protein S which facilitates the viral entry. Therefore, TMPRSS2 and HAT could be targeted for potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for proliferation, which is targeted by remdesivir that is currently approved for emergency use by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We need to adopt a multifaceted approach when combating SARS-CoV-2 because it presents several challenges including medical, psychological, socioeconomic, and ethical.

Dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering (DLS/ELS) techniques were used for the measurement of the hydrodynamic diameter, the polydispersity index, and the ??-potential of the prepared nanosystems. The incorporation of the P407 resulted in a size reduction of all systems. A decrease in the hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index were also found as a result of increasing the storage temperature from 4 C to 25 C, attributed to P407. The experiments that were carried out in FBS, showed that the addition of P407 improved systems stealth properties. Concluding, we propose P407 as a promising alternative to PEG in the development of lipid nanoparticles with optimized bio- and shelf-stability.","output":"Chimeric liposomes decorated with P407: an alternative biomaterial for producing stealth nano-therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tonic water is known to cause fixed eruptions (FEs), but severe drug eruption is rarely reported to date.

The correlations between JAK1 expression and its methylation level and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. The KaplanCMeier plotter database was used to evaluate the prognostic value of JAK1 in LUAD. The signaling pathways associated with JAK1 expression were identified by performing a GSEA. The CIBERSORT and TIMER databases were used to analyze the correlations between JAK1 and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In addition, the JAK1 expression and proportion of immune cells in LUAD cell lines were analyzed. The JAK1 expression was remarkably decreased in patients with LUAD and significantly correlated with the clinical features of patients with LUAD. The JAK1 methylation level was increased and negatively correlated with its mRNA expression. A decrease in JAK1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis. The results of GSEA showed that cell adhesion, tumorigenesis, and immune-related signaling pathways were mainly enriched. JAK1 was positively associated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and the results of CIBERSORT analysis suggested that JAK1 was correlated with monotypes and M1 macrophages. The results of the TIMER database analysis confirmed that JAK1 was closely associated with the gene markers of M1 macrophages.

Therefore it is important to understand the pathology underlying the development of CM and SMA, as opposed to uncomplicated malaria (UM). Different host responses to infection are likely to be reflected in plasma proteome-patterns that associate with clinical status and therefore provide indicators of the pathogenesis of these syndromes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Plasma and comprehensive clinical data for discovery and validation cohorts were obtained as part of a prospective case-control study of severe childhood malaria at the main tertiary hospital of the city of Ibadan, an urban and densely populated holoendemic malaria area in Nigeria. A total of 946 children participated in this study. Plasma was subjected to high-throughput proteomic profiling. Statistical pattern-recognition methods were used to find proteome-patterns that defined disease groups. Plasma proteome-patterns accurately distinguished children with CM and with SMA from those with UM, and from healthy or severely ill malaria-negative children. CONCLUSIONS: We report that an accurate definition of the major childhood malaria syndromes can be achieved using plasma proteome-patterns.

Heparin-binding peptides (HBPs) are suitable nonanticoagulant agents that are capable of antagonizing binding of heparin-binding pathogens to HSPGs. Here, we review and discuss the use of HBPs as viral uptake inhibitors and will address their benefits and limitations to treat viral infections. Furthermore, we will discuss a variant of these peptides that is in the clinic and can be considered as a novel therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

These models are primarily based on an average population approach and often ignore the role of social determinants in predicting the course of a pandemic and the impact of policy interventions. Ignoring social determinants in models may cause or exacerbate inequalities. This limitation has not been previously explored in the context of the current pandemic, where COVID-19 has been found to disproportionately affect marginalised racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Therefore, our primary goal is to identify the extent to which COVID-19 models incorporate the social determinants of health in predicting outcomes of the pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases from December 2019 to August 2020. We will assess all infectious disease modelling studies for inclusion of social factors that meet the following criteria: (a) focused on human spread of SARS-CoV-2; (b) modelling studies; (c) interventional or non-interventional studies; and (d) focused on one of the following outcomes: COVID-19-related outcomes (eg, cases, deaths), non-COVID-19-related outcomes (ie, impacts of the pandemic or control policies on other health conditions or health services), or impact of the pandemic or control policies on economic outcomes. Data will only be extracted from models incorporating social factors. We will report the percentage of models that considered social factors, indicate which social factors were considered, and describe how social factors were incorporated into the conceptualisation and implementation of the infectious disease models. The extracted data will also be used to create a narrative synthesis of the results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required as only secondary data will be collected.

This study explored the experience of young people, parents and clinicians when therapy was transitioned to virtual provision as a result of the UK lockdown in March 2020. METHODS: A mixed-method approach was used in this study. Online questionnaires that included a mixture of rating (Likert scale) and free-text response questions were completed by 53 young people with any eating disorder, 75 parents and 23 clinicians. Questions focused on the experience of online treatment as well as the impact on engagement, perceived treatment efficacy and preferences around treatment mode in the future. Likert scale questions were analysed using a summary approach. Free-text responses were analysed qualitatively using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Responses to rating scale questions indicate satisfaction with treatment, good engagement and ability to manage technology. Young people who had transitioned care, rather than started care virtually in lockdown, rated therapy as less effective. However, individual accounts of experience were more varied. Reflexive thematic analysis of free-text responses identified key themes of 1) Making it work, 2) Home as a therapeutic space, and 3) Disrupted connection and 4) Into the future. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for ongoing care during the pandemic and for future implementation of virtual care in the treatment of young people with eating disorders. Particular issues arising are the trade-off between accessibility and therapeutic engagement and depth and need for consideration of equal access to treatment in socially unequal societies.

Further, it affects the financial and natural resource market simultaneously, as both are considered complementary goods. The volatility in the oil prices deteriorates the global financial market to substantiate the financial resource (oil) curse hypothesis primarily filled with earlier studies. In contrast, this study moved forward and extended the given relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in a panel of 81 different countries. The studys main objective is to examine the volatility in the domestic credit provided to the private sector due to oil shocks and the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. The study is essential to assess the healthcare vulnerability in the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the damage of financial stability, causing deterioration in the oil rents to affect the global sustainability agenda. The study employed statistical techniques to get sound inferences of the parameter estimates, including robust least squares regression, seemingly unrelated regression, and innovation accounting matrix to get a variable estimate at the level and inter-temporal framework. The results confirmed the U-shaped relationship between oil rents and financial development during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it verifies the financial resource (oil) curse hypothesis at the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later down, it supports the capital market when economies are resuming their economic activities and maintaining the SOPs to restrain coronavirus at a global scale. The qualitative assessment confirmed the negative effect of financial development and oil shocks on environmental quality during the pandemic crisis. The innovation accounting matrix shows that the COVID-19 pandemic will primarily be the main factor that intervenes in the relationship between oil rents and financial development, which proceed towards the resource curse hypothesis during the following years time period.

A subtype of patients genetically susceptible to gluten sensitivities are Celiac Disease (CeD) patients, who are carriers of the HLA DR3/DQ2 or HLA DR4/DQ8 haplotypes. Although 85-95% of all CeD patients carry HLA DQ2, up to 25-50% of the world population carry this haplotype with only a minority developing CeD. This suggests that CeD and other gluten sensitivities are mediated by factors beyond genetics. The contribution of innate immune system signaling has been generally understudied in the context of gluten sensitivities. Thus, here we examined the role of NOD-like receptors (NLRs), a subtype of pattern recognition receptors, in maintaining the composition of the gut microbiome in animals maintained on a GFD. Human transcriptomics data revealed significant increases in the gene expression of multiple NLR family members, across functional groups, in patients with active CeD compared to control specimens. However, NLRX1 was uniquely down-regulated during active disease. NLRX1 is a negative regulatory NLR that functions to suppress inflammatory signaling and has been postulate to prevent inflammation-induced dysbiosis. Using Nlrx1(-/-) mice maintained on either a normal or gluten-free diet, we show that loss of NLRX1 alters the microbiome composition, and a distinctive shift further ensues following adherence to a GFD, including a reciprocal loss of beneficial microbes and increase in opportunistic bacterial populations. Finally, we evaluated the functional impact of an altered gut microbiome by assessing short- and medium-chain fatty acid production. These studies revealed significant differences in a selection of metabolic markers that when paired with 16S rRNA sequencing data could reflect an overall imbalance and loss of immune system homeostasis in the gastrointestinal system.","output":"NLRX1 Deficiency Alters the Gut Microbiome and Is Further Exacerbated by Adherence to a Gluten-Free Diet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In ecologic analyses of US states, piecewise multivariable models showed lower post- vs. pre-mask requirement case-rate slopes, with -1.0% (95%CI: -1.34%, -0.57%) and -0.44% (95%CI: -0.86%, -0.03%) per 100,000 per day among early- and late- versus never-adopter states, respectively.

Protein kinases encoded by pathogens, as well as host kinases required for survival of intracellular pathogens, carry considerable potential as targets for antimalarial intervention (Adderley et al. Trends Parasitol 37:508C524, 2021; Wei et al. Cell Rep Med 2:100423, 2021). To date, no comprehensive P. vivax kinome assembly has been conducted; and the P. falciparum kinome, first assembled in 2004, requires an update. The present study, aimed to fill these gaps, utilises a recently published structurally-validated multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the human kinome (Modi et al. Sci Rep 9:19790, 2019). This MSA is used as a scaffold to assist the alignment of all protein kinase sequences from P. falciparum and P. vivax, and (where possible) their assignment to specific kinase groups/families. RESULTS: We were able to assign six P. falciparum previously classified as OPK or orphans (i.e. with no clear phylogenetic relation to any of the established ePK groups) to one of the aforementioned ePK groups. Direct phylogenetic comparison established that despite an overall high level of similarity between the P. falciparum and P. vivax kinomes, which will help in selecting targets for intervention, there are differences that may underlie the biological specificities of these species. Furthermore, we highlight a number of Plasmodium kinases that have a surprisingly high level of similarity with their human counterparts and therefore not well suited as targets for drug discovery. CONCLUSIONS: Direct comparison of the kinomes of Homo sapiens, P. falciparum and P. vivax sheds additional light on the previously documented divergence of many P. falciparum and P. vivax kinases from those of their human host. We provide the first direct kinome comparison between the phylogenetically distinct species of P. falciparum and P. vivax, illustrating the key similarities and differences which must be considered in the context of kinase-directed antimalarial drug discovery, and discuss the divergences and similarities between the human and Plasmodium kinomes to inform future searches for selective antimalarial intervention.

The primary outcome was death by 90 days after randomization. RESULTS A total of 3298 patients were enrolled; 1645 were randomly assigned to the pantoprazole group and 1653 to the placebo group. Data on the primary outcome were available for 3282 patients (99.5%). At 90 days, 510 patients (31.1%) in the pantoprazole group and 499 (30.4%) in the placebo group had died (relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.13; P=0.76). During the ICU stay, at least one clinically important event (a composite of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, or myocardial ischemia) had occurred in 21.9% of patients assigned to pantoprazole and 22.6% of those assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.11). In the pantoprazole group, 2.5% of patients had clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding, as compared with 4.2% in the placebo group. The number of patients with infections or serious adverse reactions and the percentage of days alive without life support within 90 days were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Among adult patients in the ICU who were at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, mortality at 90 days and the number of clinically important events were similar in those assigned to pantoprazole and those assigned to placebo.

Allogenic SVF transplants could be based on the possibility to use decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) as a scaffold from a donor then re-cellularized by ASCs of the recipient, in order to develop the advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) in fully personalized clinical approaches. A systematic review of this field has been realized in accordance with the Preferred Reporting for Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Multistep research of the PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Clinicaltrials.gov, Scopus database, and Cochrane databases has been conducted to identify articles and investigations on human allogenic ASCs transplant for clinical use. Of the 341 articles identified, 313 were initially assessed for eligibility on the basis of the abstract. Of these, only 29 met all the predetermined criteria for inclusion according to the PICOS (patients, intervention, comparator, outcomes, and study design) approach, and 19 have been included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). Ninety-one percent of the studies previously screened (284 papers) were focused on the in vitro results and pre-clinical experiments. The allogenic use regarded the treatment of perianal fistulas, diabetic foot ulcers, knee osteoarthritis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, refractory rheumatoid arthritis, pediatrics disease, fecal incontinence, ischemic heart disease, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, lateral epicondylitis, and soft tissue defects.

The use of an appropriate scoring system can lead to the conveyance of the findings in a more understandable way and the elimination of differences in interpretations. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imaging reporting and data system (CO-RADS) in admitted patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: This retrospective study included all patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia suspicion within March 20-May 15, 2020, who were examined by both CT and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at initial presentation. Four radiologists, who were blinded to the rRT-PCR results and medical history, assessed all images independently and classified the CT findings according to the CO-RADS previously defined. Diagnostic value of the scoring system and interobserver agreement in rRT-PCR positive-negative groups and for CO-RADS 1-5 were evaluated. Results: In this study, 274 (153 men and 121 women;48.8 +/- 17.3 years) rRT-PCR positive and 437 (208 men and 229 women;49.0 +/- 19.5 years) rRT-PCR negative individuals were included. It was found that CO-RADS had a good diagnostic performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve of 0.857. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were obtained at 81.9%, 89.4%, 75.7%, 92.5%, and 84.8%, respectively. The interobserver agreement of four radiologists in CO-RADS 1 and 5 was substantial to almost perfect according to the kappa values. Other CO-RADS scores showed a fair to moderate agreement. The interrater agreement was slightly higher in the PCR (-) patient group than in the positive one. Conclusion: In conclusion, CO-RADS was a successful scoring system for distinguishing highly suspicious cases in terms of COVID-19 infection lung involvement, showing high interobserver agreement.","output":"Evaluation of Chest CT Findings using the Reporting and Data System of Patients with Suspected COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Critical Care Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Stroke like lesions has been documented in COVID-19 patients Although the exact stroke-incidence is unknown, it was reported to be around 5 % in a hospitalized cohort in Wuhan and 1 1 % in a study in New York City CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents to ER with fever, cough, myalgia, increasing shortness of breath, and confusion for one day His daughter is known COVID-19 positive The patient was noted to be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxic to 90% at room air Chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates and the COVID-19 test was positive The patient was immediately intubated due to his significant acute respiratory distress Inflammatory markers were significantly elevated: Troponin T: 5 86, Lactate dehydrogenase: 542, CRP: 350 mg/l, Ferritin: 1878, D-dimer: &gt;20, fibrinogen: 1094, Total Creatinine kinase: 2260 and creatinine: 5 7 His course was complicated by septic shock requiring three vasopressors;acute kidney injury requiring hemodialysis;Enterococcus Faecalis bacteremia treated with Ampicillin, and Klebsiella pneumonia sensitive to ceftriaxone EKGs showed new onset of atrial fibrillation without ST changes Echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction without wall motion abnormalities His significant troponin elevation was likely due to myonecrosis related to COVID-19 infection and he was started on heparin drip The patient respiratory status continued to improve however he remained obtunded Head CT showed acute right frontal hemorrhage and focal hyperdense foci in the left frontal lobe and basal ganglia Brain MRI showed a 2 8 x 2 4 cm lesion situated in the right sub-frontal region with appearances of abscess versus necrotic tissue and extensive bilateral scattered deep white matter infarcts Neurosurgery didnt recommend any intervention due to poor prognosis After 27 days of intubation, the family requested comfort measures, and the patient was terminally extubated DISCUSSION: Sepsis-induced coagulopathy is one of the hallmarks of severe COVID-19, usually manifests as a high D-dimer and elevated fibrinogen It induces a systemic inflammatory response with endothelial dysfunction and microthrombosis predisposing to acute strokes The risk of developing a cerebrovascular disease is multifactorial and includes cardiovascular risk factors, old age, and severe COVID-19 disease manifestations with sings of hypercoagulability In this case, the stroke like-lesions could be related to septic emboli with the conversation to hemorrhage due to heparin use in the setting of severe COVID-19 infection CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke has been reported as a complication of severe COVID-19 infection The definite mechanism is unknown, but these findings can indicate poor prognosis with potential neurological sequelae and increased mortality Reference #1: https://www ncbi nlm nih gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202903/ Reference #2: https://www ncbi nlm nih gov/pmc/articles/PMC7236667/ Reference #3: https://jamanetwork com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2766766 DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Karim Anis, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Anastasia Maltseva, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Lady Sanchez Fernandez, source=Web Response","output":"Fatal Intracerebral Hemorrhage in a Patient with Severe Covid-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this review, we report a case of a bone's metastatic breast cancer in Malian patient treated by chemotherapy in whom SRAS-COV-2's diagnosis was made 9 days after the onset gastrointestinal symptoms.

METHODS: We retrospectively studied stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-MPI studies performed during the peak of COVID-19 restrictions at the University of Alabama Medical Center in comparison to the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: SPECT-MPI volume was reduced from 553 per month in 2019 to 105 per month in 2020. The proportion of abnormal SPECT-MPI for the 2020 cohort (61  13 years, 48% men, 41% black) was not different from the 2019 cohort (62  12 years, 48% men, 42% black) (31% vs. 27%, p = 0.4). Similar proportion of patients in the 2 cohorts had abnormal myocardial perfusion, moderate-large perfusion defects, myocardial ischemia, myocardial scar, and abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction. The proportion of abnormal SPECT-MPIs was not different based on whether patients were evaluated face-to-face or by telemedicine (28% vs. 27%, p > 0.9) but was higher for cardiology providers (40% vs. 20%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant reduction in the number of SPECT-MPI studies performed during the peak restrictions from the pandemic. Despite this restriction, the rate of abnormal studies remained stable.

Research has also shown that LREs tend to affect technology acceptance which in turn affects learning outcomes as well. Today though, the negative psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the sudden transmission to obligatory remote education might yield different functions of emotions and acceptance on learning outcomes. In this context, the current study seeks to model the relations between students negative emotions, acceptance of (emergency) remote education, and self-perceived knowledge improvement. The suggested model was examined and validated on 116 university students that attended fully remote courses in Greece during the COVID-19 crisis. The results suggested that negative emotions of boredom and cognitive load are significant predictors of students acceptance of remote learning components: i) online attending a lecture, ii) online communicating with professor, and iii) online collaborating with peers. Anxiety directly affected perceived knowledge improvement, boredom, and cognitive load; Boredom was also affected by cognitive load. In addition, acceptance of remote learning components indirectly affected perceived knowledge improvement mediated by learnability. Boredom was the strongest predictor of online attending a lecture and online collaborating with peers, while online communication with professor was the strongest predictor of learnability. The contribution of this study and the structural findings are further discussed in the paper.","output":"Negative emotions, cognitive load, acceptance, and self-perceived learning outcome in emergency remote education during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxytocin (OXT) modulates social interactions, attenuates stressful responses and can decrease drug-seeking and taking behaviors. In previous studies, we observed that social defeat (SD) induced a long-lasting increase in ethanol intake and neuroinflammation in male mice.

Therefore, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the effect of 1a?mg/kg of OXT administered 30a?min before each episode of SD on ethanol consumption and the neuroinflammatory response in adult male mice. Three weeks after the last SD, mice underwent oral ethanol self-administration (SA) procedure, and striatal levels of the two chemokines CX3CL1 and CXCL12 were measured after the last SD and at the end of the ethanol SA. OXT administration blocked the increase in voluntary ethanol consumption observed in defeated mice, although it did not affect motivation for ethanol. An increase in the striatal levels of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 was observed in defeated animals immediately after the last defeat and after the ethanol SA. However, defeated mice treated with OXT did not show this increase in the neuroinflammatory response.

The findings from the learning diaries indicate the students thirst for formal knowledge on sustainability, which they connected to their professional development and yearning for action. The learning diaries also suggest students increasing awareness of sustainability as a systemic and structural issue during the course, which aligns with the transformative learning framework used.

Healthy, intact endothelium exhibits an antithrombotic, protective surface between the vascular lumen and vascular smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between anti- and prooxidants, with a subsequent increase of reactive oxygen species, leading to tissue damage. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is of vital importance in the pathobiology of vascular disease. Convincing data indicate that angiotensin II accelerates hypertension and augments the production of reactive oxygen species. This leads to the generation of a proinflammatory phenotype in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells by the up-regulation of adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines. In addition, angiotensin II also seems to increase thrombin generation, possibly via a direct impact on tissue factor. However, the mechanism of cross-talk between inflammation and haemostasis can also contribute to prothrombotic states in inflammatory environments. Thus, blocking of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might be an approach to reduce both inflammatory and thrombotic complications in high-risk patients. During COVID-19, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may be activated. The levels of angiotensin II could contribute to the ongoing inflammation, which might result in a cytokine storm, a complication that significantly impairs prognosis. At the outbreak of COVID-19 concerns were raised about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker drugs in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension or other cardiovascular comorbidities. However, the present evidence is in favor of continuing to use of these drugs. Based on experimental evidence, blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might even exert a potentially protective influence in the setting of COVID-19.","output":"The Impact of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System on Inflammation, Coagulation, and Atherothrombotic Complications, and to Aggravated COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a major health problem worldwide.

Understanding their antecedents might help organizations to prevent burn\\\\out and to enhance employability among this occupational group. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to provide insight in the relationship between job characteristics and job crafting behavior on the one hand and job outcomes (burn\\\\out symptoms and employability) on the other hand. METHODS: Data from two surveys in 2020 and 2021 were collected in a longitudinal study among 238 Dutch gastroenterologists. The data were analyzed with multiple linear regression analyses and paired\\\\samples t\\\\tests. RESULTS: Job characteristics, specifically job aspects that require sustained physical and/or psychological effort or skills (i.e., job demands), are important predictors of burn\\\\out symptoms among gastroenterologists. Specifically, high quantitative and emotional workload are significantly related to more burn\\\\out symptoms. No strong relationship was found between job crafting and burn\\\\out symptoms. Furthermore, job aspects that reduce the negative impact of these demanding aspects and that help to achieve work goals (i.e., job resources), and job demands to some extent, significantly predict employability. In particular, high job autonomy is related to higher employability, and high quantitative workload is associated with lower employability. Job crafting does not significantly affect employability. Furthermore, levels of burn\\\\out symptoms and employability differed only little across time. CONCLUSION: In gastroenterologists, a high quantitative workload and emotional workload are associated with a higher burn\\\\out risk, while low job autonomy and high quantitative workload are associated with more negative perceptions of employability. To prevent burn\\\\out and to create positive perceptions of employability, it is important to take these aspects into account.","output":"Burn\\\\out and employability rates are impacted by the level of job autonomy and workload among Dutch gastroenterologists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o A pandemia trouxe inmeros desafios aos servi?os de sade e isso n?o foi diferente nos servi?os de hemoterapia.

Despite considerable progress made toward identifying and evaluating several synthetic broad-spectrum antivirals against hCoV infections, a narrow therapeutic window has limited their success. Enhancing the endogenous interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) response is another antiviral strategy that has been known for decades. However, the side effects of pegylated type-I IFNs (IFN-Is) and the proinflammatory response detected after delayed IFN-I therapy have discouraged their clinical use. In contrast to IFN-Is, IFN-, a dominant IFN at the epithelial surface, has been shown to be less proinflammatory. Consequently, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of IFN- in hCoV-infected airway epithelial cells and mice. Human primary airway epithelial cells treated with a single dose of IFN-I (IFN-) and IFN- showed similar ISG expression, whereas cells treated with two doses of IFN- expressed elevated levels of ISG compared to that of IFN--treated cells. Similarly, mice treated with two doses of IFN- were better protected than mice that received a single dose, and a combination of prophylactic and delayed therapeutic regimens completely protected mice from a lethal Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) infection. A two-dose IFN- regimen significantly reduced lung viral titers and inflammatory cytokine levels with marked improvement in lung inflammation. Collectively, we identified an effective regimen for IFN- use and demonstrated the protective efficacy of IFN- in MERS-CoV-infected mice. IMPORTANCE Effective antiviral agents are urgently required to prevent and treat individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viral infections. The COVID-19 pandemic has catapulted our efforts to identify, develop, and evaluate several antiviral agents. However, a narrow therapeutic window has limited the protective efficacy of several broad-spectrum and CoV-specific antivirals. IFN- is an antiviral agent of interest due to its ability to induce a robust endogenous antiviral state and low levels of inflammation. Here, we evaluated the protective efficacy and effective treatment regimen of IFN- in mice infected with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV. We show that while prophylactic and early therapeutic IFN- administration is protective, delayed treatment is detrimental. Notably, a combination of prophylactic and delayed therapeutic administration of IFN- protected mice from severe MERS. Our results highlight the prophylactic and therapeutic use of IFN- against lethal hCoV and likely other viral lung infections.","output":"Effective Interferon Lambda Treatment Regimen To Control Lethal MERS-CoV Infection in Mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lateral flow devices (LFDs) are viral antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 that produce a rapid result, are inexpensive and easy to operate. They have been advocated for use by the World Health Organisation to help control outbreaks and break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 infections. There are now several studies assessing their accuracy but as yet no systematic review. Our aims were to assess the sensitivity and specificity of LFDs in a systematic review and summarise the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. METHODS: A targeted search of Pubmed and Medxriv, using PRISMA principles, was conducted identifying clinical studies assessing the sensitivity and specificity of LFDs as their primary outcome compared to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Based on extracted data sensitivity and specificity was calculated for each study. Data was pooled based on manufacturer of LFD and split based on operator (self-swab or by trained professional) and sensitivity and specificity data were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers were identified involving over 26,000 test results. Sensitivity from individual studies ranged from 37.7% (95% CI 30.6-45.5) to 99.2% (95% CI 95.5-99.9) and specificity from 92.4% (95% CI 87.5-95.5) to 100.0% (95% CI 99.7-100.0). Operation of the test by a trained professional or by the test subject with self-swabbing produced comparable results. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified that the performance of lateral flow devices is heterogeneous and dependent on the manufacturer. Some perform with high specificity but a great range of sensitivities were shown (38.32-99.19%). Test performance does not appear dependent on the operator. Potentially, LFDs could support the scaling up of mass testing to aid track and trace methodology and break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 with the additional benefit of providing individuals with the results in a much shorter time frame.","output":"A systematic review of the sensitivity and specificity of lateral flow devices in the detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in our country, Turkey, more than two million people have been infected and more than 20,000 people have died. Although children infected less frequently and generally have a milder findings of COVID-19, the number of patients with a more severe clinical course as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is increasing significantly. However, it has not been shown exactly how biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD)s, which we frequently use in our pediatric rheumatology practice, and/or the underlying rheumatological diseases affect the clinical course of COVID-19. Objectives: Here, we aimed to reveal the outcome of COVID-19 infection in our patients with pediatric rheumatic disease and treated with bDMARDs. Methods: During the period between April 1, 2020 and December 1, 2020, the patients who received bDMARDs were evaluated at the regular outpatient clinic follow-up or by telemedicine with a maximum of 3 months interval. Clinical and demographic characteristics, COVID-19 data and outcome of these patients were retrospectively collected. Results: Out of the 436 patients treated with bDMARDs, 39 children were infected with COVID-19. The diagnosis was confirmed in 37 patients by RT-PCR (nasalpharyngeal swab) and in two by antibody test. Twenty-two (56.4%) patients were female (17 male, %43.6) and the median age of patients were 12.3 years (min-max: 1.2-20.9). The primary diagnosis of patients were as follows;20 juvenile idiopathic arthritis (six were systemic subtype), 12 systemic autoinflammatory diseases, three vasculitis, three chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and one Sj?gren's syndrome. Prior to COVID-19 infection, 13 patients (33.3%) were using canakinumab, seven were infliximab (18%), five were adalimumab (12.8%), four were etanercept 10.2%), four were tocilizumab (10.2%), three were anakinra (7.7%), two were rituximab (5.1%), and one was tofacitinib (2.6%). Of the 39 patients, 21 had at least one COVID-19-related symptom, while 18 patients were asymptomatic. No laboratory or imaging tests was performed for asymptomatic patients and they were followed up without treatment at home isolation. Laboratory tests revealed that fourteen patients had elevated acute phase reactants, six had elevated D-dimer levels, three had lymphopenia (<1000/mm3), and three had hyperferritinemia. Hospitalization was required in 20 patients (51.3%) at median of 7-days (minmax: 3-17) and pediatric intensive care unit admission in one. Five patients developed MIS-C and one of these patients was followed up in the pediatric intensive care unit. Myocardial dysfunction was developed in this patient and he was died. The other four patients fully recovered with no remain morbidity. Conclusion: Considering the literature data and the results of our study, it is not possible to say that currently used bDMARDs worse the course of COVID-19 infection. In patients with underlying risk factors for hyperinflammation, as in one of our patients, COVID-19 may cause mortality regardless of the use of bDMARDs. Whether bDMARDs does not affect the severity of the disease, but it is still not true to say that these drugs are protective. Since cessation of bDMARDs for COVID-risk may cause exacerbation of the primary rheumatic disease, continuing with current treatments seems an appropriate approach.","output":"Clinical course of COVID-19 in children with rheumatic disease under biologic therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 A total of 213 countries and territories around the world have reported a total of 27,948,441 confirmed cases as on September 9, 2020 This article adopted two non-linear growth models (Gompertz, Verhulst) and exponential model (SIR) to analyse the coronavirus pandemic across the world All the models have been used for active COVID-19 patients predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of January 30, 2020 to June 4, 2020 Outbreak of COVID-19 disease has been analysed for India, Pakistan, Myanmar (Burma), Brazil, Italy and Germany till June 4, 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of positive cases for the next 28 days Verhulst model fitting effect is better than Gompertz and SIR model with R-score 0 9973 The proposed model perform better as compare to other three existing models with R-score 0 9981 These above models can be adapted to forecast in long term intervals, based on the predictions for a short interval as of June 5, 2020 and June 30, 2020, active COVID-19 patients for India, Pakistan, Italy, Germany, Brazil and Myanmar predicted as (236,170, 88,998, 234,066, 184,922, 645,057 and 235) and (486,357, 218,864, 240,545, 193,727, 1,211,567 and 309)","output":"Prediction of COVID-19 active cases using exponential and non-linear growth models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aberrant DNA methylation often silences transcription of tumor-suppressor genes and is considered a hallmark of myeloid neoplasms. Similarly, histone deacetylation represses transcription of genes responsible for cell differentiation/death. A previous clinical study suggested potential pharmacodynamic antagonism between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA). Herein, to determine such antagonism, we used MDS/AML lines and NHD13 transgenic mice, and demonstrated that treatment with the pan-HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) significantly decreased TET2 expression and global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels. Mechanistically, our RNAi screen revealed that HDAC4 was responsible for maintaining TET2 levels. Accordingly, HDAC4 knockout reduced expression levels of MTSS1, a known TET2 target, an event associated with decreased 5hmC enrichment on the MTSS1 enhancer. Retrospective analysis of GEO datasets demonstrated that lower HDAC4 levels predict worse prognosis for AML patients. In an MDS-L xenografted immunodeficient mouse model, vitamin C co-treatment prevented TET2 loss of activity seen following SAHA treatment. Accordingly, vitamin C co-treatment further reduced MDS-L cell engraftment relative to SAHA alone. In summary, our findings suggest that co-administration of a TET2 agonist with pan-HDACi treatment could effectively counter potential diminution in TET2 activity resulting from pan-HDACi treatment alone, providing a rationale for evaluating such combinations against high-risk MDS/AML.","output":"HDAC4 inhibition disrupts TET2 function in high-risk MDS and AML"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To study the GI symptoms in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. DESIGN: We analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 95 cases with SARS-CoV-2 caused coronavirus disease 2019. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and GI tissues. RESULTS: Among the 95 patients, 58 cases exhibited GI symptoms of which 11 (11.6%) occurred on admission and 47 (49.5%) developed during hospitalisation. Diarrhoea (24.2%), anorexia (17.9%) and nausea (17.9%) were the main symptoms with five (5.3%), five (5.3%) and three (3.2%) cases occurred on the illness onset, respectively. A substantial proportion of patients developed diarrhoea during hospitalisation, potentially aggravated by various drugs including antibiotics.

UC-MSC administration has a therapeutic benefit for severe COVID-19 patients even in the recovery period. In this paper, we aimed to present our clinical experience with UC-MSC treatment in severe and critical severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this study we evaluated the clinical outcome of severe/critically severe 210 COVID-19 patients treated with UC-MSCs, 1C2  10(6) per kilogram to 210 patients from 15/10/2020 until 25/04/2021. RESULTS: Out of 99 critically severe intubated patients we have observed good clinical progress/discharged from ICU in 52 (52.5%) patients. Where as 86 (77.5%) of 111 severe unintubated patients discharged from ICU. Intubated 47 (47.5%) patients and unintubated 25 (22.5%) patients pass away. Significantly higher survival was observed in patients who underwent UC-MSCs before intubation (OR = 1.475, 95% CI = 1.193C1.824 p < 0.001). It was observed that the SaO(2) parameter tended to improve after UC-MSC therapy compared to all groups. But SaO(2) parameter between intubated and unintubated groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05), while in discharged cases SaO(2) parameter was statistically significant (p = 0.01). Besides, there was a statistically significant relation with intubation status, age (OR = 3.868, 95% CI = 0.574C7.152 p = 0.02) and weigh (OR = 6.768, 95% CI = 3.423C10.112 p < 0.001) thus presented an elevated risk for COVID-19. The linear regression analysis confirmed that the high weight was associated with the risk of intubation in COVID-19 (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: According to our results and from recent studies, UC-MSC treatment is safe with high potential to be used as an added therapeutic treatment for severe COVID-19 patients. Our experience showed that UC-MSC therapy may restore oxygenation and downregulate cytokine storm in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. We advice wider randomised studies to discover the detailed therapeutic pathophysiology of the MSCs on COVID-19 patients.

During transmission, host cell invasion is controlled by a large-scale (200C300 ?) conformational change of the Spike protein. This conformational rearrangement leads to membrane fusion, which creates transmembrane pores through which the viral genome is passed to the host. During Spike-protein-mediated fusion, the fusion peptides must be released from the core of the protein and associate with the host membrane. While infection relies on this transition between the prefusion and postfusion conformations, there has yet to be a biophysical characterization reported for this rearrangement. That is, structures are available for the endpoints, though the intermediate conformational processes have not been described. Interestingly, the Spike protein possesses many post-translational modifications, in the form of branched glycans that flank the surface of the assembly. With the current lack of data on the pre-to-post transition, the precise role of glycans during cell invasion has also remained unclear. To provide an initial mechanistic description of the pre-to-post rearrangement, an all-atom model with simplified energetics was used to perform thousands of simulations in which the protein transitions between the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These simulations indicate that the steric composition of the glycans can induce a pause during the Spike protein conformational change. We additionally show that this glycan-induced delay provides a critical opportunity for the fusion peptides to capture the host cell. In contrast, in the absence of glycans, the viral particle would likely fail to enter the host. This analysis reveals how the glycosylation state can regulate infectivity, while providing a much-needed structural framework for studying the dynamics of this pervasive pathogen.","output":"Sterically confined rearrangements of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein control cell invasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Rwanda has made significant advancements in medical and economic development over the last 20 years and has emerged as a leader in healthcare in the East African region. The COVID-19 pandemic, which reached Rwanda in March 2020, presented new and unique challenges for infectious disease control. The objective of this paper is to characterize Rwanda's domestic response to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight effective strategies so that other countries, including high and middle-income countries, can learn from its innovative initiatives. Methods: Government publications describing Rwanda's healthcare capacity were first consulted to obtain the country's baseline context. Next, official government and healthcare system communications, including case counts, prevention and screening protocols, treatment facility practices, and behavioral guidelines for the public, were read thoroughly to understand the course of the pandemic in Rwanda and the specific measures in the response. Results: As of 31 December 2020, Rwanda has recorded 8,383 cumulative COVID-19 cases, 6,542 recoveries, and 92 deaths since the first case on 14 March 2020. The Ministry of Health, Rwanda Biomedical Centre, and the Epidemic and Surveillance Response division have collaborated on preparative measures since the pandemic began in January 2020. The formation of a Joint Task Force in early March led to the Coronavirus National Preparedness and Response Plan, an extensive six-month plan that established a national incident management system and detailed four phases of a comprehensive national response. Notable strategies have included disseminating public information through drones, robots for screening and inpatient care, and official communications through social media platforms to combat misinformation and mobilize a cohesive response from the population.

Herein, we show that human M1 macrophages generated by IFN-?3 and IL-12- and IL-18-stimulated monocyte-derived macrophages (M0) produce significant levels of IFN-?3. Further stimulation of IL-12/IL-18-primed macrophages or M1 macrophages with agonists for TLR-2, TLR-3, or TLR-4 significantly enhanced IFN-?3 production in contrast to the similarly stimulated M0, M2a, M2b, and M2c macrophages. Similarly, M1 macrophages generated from COVID-19-infected patients' macrophages produced IFN-?3 that was enhanced following LPS stimulation. The inhibition of M1 differentiation by Jak inhibitors reversed LPS-induced IFN-?3 production, suggesting that differentiation with IFN-?3 plays a key role in IFN-?3 induction. We subsequently investigated the signaling pathway(s) responsible for TLR-4-induced IFN-?3 production in M1 macrophages. Our results show that TLR-4-induced IFN-?3 production is regulated by the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) through the activation of PI3K, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/2 (mTORC1/2), and the JNK MAPK pathways.

We recently demonstrated that higher grief levels are experienced after COVID-19-related bereavement than natural bereavement. Death circumstances during the pandemic (e.g., reduced social support, limited opportunities for death rituals) may also hamper the grief process for non-COVID-19-related bereavement, yet no quantitative research has specifically addressed this issue. OBJECTIVES: To test if grief severity is higher during than before the lockdown after non-COVID-19-related bereavement. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey including questions on sociodemographic and loss-related variables and a grief measure was conducted among a sample of 1600 bereaved adults (78% females), participating before (n = 731) or during (n = 869) the pandemic, including people who had experienced a loss before the pandemic (n = 456) or during the pandemic (n = 200) recently (five months ago or less). RESULTS: No significant differences emerged between grief levels in people participating before or during the pandemic. However, being recently bereaved during the pandemic elicited more severe grief than before it (d = 0.17; d = 0.18). Effects remained significant after controlling analyses for relevant loss-related variables. CONCLUSION: Among all bereaved persons, grief severity was no different during the pandemic compared with before the pandemic. However, experiencing a recent loss during the pandemic elicited more severe acute grief reactions than before the pandemic, suggesting that dealing with loss may be more difficult during this ongoing health crisis.","output":"Grief Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multiple Group Comparisons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Incidences of emerging/re-emerging deadly viral infections have significantly affected human health despite extraordinary progress in the area of biomedical knowledge.

The Vaccination Attitudes Examination scale is a brief 12-item questionnaire targeting adults, that assesses general attitudes towards vaccination. The aims of the study were (1) to translate and adapt the original English version of the scale into French and (2) to test the psychometric properties of the scale in a French population-based sample of adults. We included 450 French speaking adults that completed the French Vaccination Attitudes Examination scale and other questionnaires in order to assess convergent and divergent validities. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the French version of the Vaccination Attitudes Examination scale replicated the factorial structure of the original scale. Moreover, it demonstrated high internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validities, and excellent temporal stability. Also, scores on the scale differentiated vaccinators from non-vaccinator respondents. Results on the scale provides us with insight into factors involved in vaccine hesitancy in France, therefore allowing French authorities and policy makers to address these specific concerns and by consequence improve vaccine acceptance rates in this country.","output":"Adaptation and validation of a French version of the Vaccination Attitudes Examination (VAX) scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world faced the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019 and early 2020, numerous clinical trials were initiated in many locations in an effort to establish the efficacy (or lack thereof) of potential treatments. As the pandemic has been shifting locations rapidly, individual studies have been at risk of failing to meet recruitment targets because of declining numbers of eligible patients with COVID-19 encountered at participating sites. It has become clear that it might take several more COVID-19 surges at the same location to achieve full enrollment and to find answers about what treatments are effective for this disease. This paper proposes an innovative approach for pooling patient-level data from multiple ongoing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that have not been configured as a network of sites. We present the statistical analysis plan of a prospective individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis (MA) from ongoing RCTs of convalescent plasma (CP). We employ an adaptive Bayesian approach for continuously monitoring the accumulating pooled data via posterior probabilities for safety, efficacy, and harm. Although we focus on RCTs for CP and address specific challenges related to CP treatment for COVID-19, the proposed framework is generally applicable to pooling data from RCTs for other therapies and disease settings in order to find answers in weeks or months, rather than years.","output":"Prospective individual patient data meta-analysis: Evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has shocked the world causing more victims than the latest global epidemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.

Therefore, this research investigates the impact of smartness on customer well-being (here, self-efficacy and technology anxiety) through (1) customer engagement with different smart service system actors (here, smart products and service providers) and (2) customer perceptions (here, personalization and intrusiveness perceptions) and their associated importance (here, need for personalization and intrusiveness sensitivity). A scenario-based experiment (n = 730) C which is preceded by a systematic review to conceptualize smartness C shows that customers perceive more personalization than intrusiveness in case of higher levels of smartness, resulting in customer engagement with the smart product and to some extent with the service provider. Via customer engagement with the smart product, higher levels of smartness stimulate self-efficacy, especially for customers with a high need for personalization. When customers need for personalization is high and their intrusiveness sensitivity is low, higher levels of smartness also reduce technology anxiety via customer engagement with the smart product. Hence, the conclusion is: The smarter, the better!, whereby the relationship between smartness and well-being (here, self-efficacy and technological anxiety) is significantly influenced by customer heterogeneity.

We aimed to identify the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on haematology patients and identify correlated factors to inform the development of appropriate supportive interventions. METHODS: Three hundred and ninety-four respondents volunteered their participation in response to a study advertisement distributed online through established haematology groups. Participants completed a self-report online survey exploring wellbeing, psychological distress, unmet supportive care needs, and fear of cancer recurrence. RESULTS: At least 1 in 3 respondents (35%) reported clinical levels of distress and nearly 1 in 3 (32%) identified at least one unmet need. Among respondents in remission (n = 134), clinical fear of cancer recurrence was reported by nearly all (95%). Unmet needs, pre-existing health conditions, younger age, financial concerns, and perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 were the dominant factors contributing to psychological distress during the pandemic. Psychological distress, lost income, perceived inadequate support from care team, perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, and being a woman were significantly associated with unmet needs. Psychological distress and concern about the impact of COVID-19 on cancer management were significantly associated with fear of cancer recurrence among respondents in remission. CONCLUSION: Results highlight the high psychological burden and unmet needs experienced by people with haematological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic and indicate a need for innovative solutions to rapidly identify distress and unmet needs during, and beyond, pandemic times.","output":"Prevalence and correlates of psychological distress, unmet supportive care needs, and fear of cancer recurrence among haematological cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A time series model is designed based on the backpropagation neural network to further optimize the innovation and development of new ventures. The specific situation of two factors is primarily analyzed as follows: the supply and demand ratio of enterprise talents and the state of entrepreneurship in the development of new ventures. The results show that the potential demand of future enterprises for big data talents can be obtained by fitting prediction sequences. Based on the BackpropagationCAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average model, the post modeling and prediction are carried out, and the coefficient 0.6235 is obtained by substituting the equation of Pearson's correlation coefficient. The analysis results suggest that the matching needs to be strengthened between the cultivation of innovative talents in universities and the demand trend of big data-related positions in enterprises. Moreover, there is a mismatch between the cultivation of innovative talents and the demand for innovative talents. Meanwhile, the mental health level of young entrepreneurs is concerned. The mental health status of young entrepreneurs is compared with the national norm data through the questionnaire survey and statistical data analysis. The results reveal that the mental health level of young entrepreneurs is significantly lower than that of the national norm, and the proportion of anxiety and depression is 29.4% and 27.5%, respectively.

Patients with similar clinical phenotypes or sepsis biomarker expression upon diagnosis may have different outcomes, suggesting that the dynamics of sepsis is critical in disease progression. A within-subject study of patients with Gram-negative bacterial sepsis with surviving and fatal outcomes was designed and single-cell transcriptomic analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected during the critical period between sepsis diagnosis and 6 h were performed. The single-cell observations in the study are consistent with trends from public datasets but also identify dynamic effects in individual cell subsets that change within hours. It is shown that platelet and erythroid precursor responses are drivers of fatal sepsis, with transcriptional signatures that are shared with severe COVID-19 disease. It is also shown that hypoxic stress is a driving factor in immune and metabolic dysfunction of monocytes and erythroid precursors. Last, the data support CD52 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for sepsis as its expression dynamically increases in lymphocytes and correlates with improved sepsis outcomes. In conclusion, this study describes the first single-cell study that analyzed short-term temporal changes in the immune cell populations and their characteristics in surviving or fatal sepsis.

The inquiry is guided by the Health Belief Model and by concepts from the domain of social networks. Research Design and Methods: Data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) were used, including the SHARE COVID-19 Survey executed in the summer of 2020. The study sample numbered 33,053 persons aged 50 and older in 26 countries. We regressed a logged count of self-protective behaviors on network-exposure severity, controlling for sociodemographic background, country, personality traits, and self-exposure severity. Age and network-exposure interaction terms were examined, as were \\"close family\\" and \\"other\\" network ties. Results: Network-exposure severity was positively associated with the extent of engagement in self-protective behaviors among older adults, but mainly among the oldest group, aged 70 and older. Awareness of exposure severity in \\"close family\\" and \\"other\\" networks were similarly associated with self-protection. Respondents from countries with the lowest rates of COVID-19 infection at the time (Latvia, Finland, and Denmark) engaged in fewer self-protective behaviors, while those from countries with high infection rates (Spain, Italy, and Portugal) self-protected to a greater degree. Discussion and Implications: The study findings point to the role of the social network, even if indirect, in promoting self-protective behaviors among the oldest segment of society. Policymakers should collaborate with the social networks of older adults in order to promote the adoption of self-protective behaviors.

At implantation, the endometrial stroma, glands, arteries and immune cells undergo anatomical and functional transformation to create the decidua, the specialized secretory endometrium of pregnancy. The maternal decidua and the invading fetal trophoblast constitute a dynamic junction that facilitates a complex immunological dialogue between the two. The decidual and peripheral immune systems together assume a pivotal role in regulating the critical balance between tolerance and defense against infection. Throughout pregnancy, this equilibrium is repeatedly subjected to microbial challenge. Acute viral infection in pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of adverse consequences for both mother and fetus. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus can cause developmental anomalies, growth restriction, preterm birth and stillbirth, while the mother is predisposed to heightened morbidity and maternal death. A rapid, effective response to invasive pathogens is therefore essential in order to avoid overwhelming maternal infection and consequent fetal compromise. This sentinel response is mediated by the innate immune system: a heritable, highly evolutionarily conserved system comprising physical barriers, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and a variety of immune cells-principally neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells-which express pattern-receptors that detect invariant molecular signatures unique to pathogenic micro-organisms. Recognition of these signatures during acute infection triggers signaling cascades that enhance antimicrobial properties such as phagocytosis, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the complement system. As well as coordinating the initial immune response, macrophages and dendritic cells present microbial antigens to lymphocytes, initiating and influencing the development of specific, long-lasting adaptive immunity. Despite extensive progress in unraveling the immunological adaptations of pregnancy, pregnant women remain particularly susceptible to certain acute viral infections and continue to experience mortality rates equivalent to those observed in pandemics several decades ago. Here, we focus specifically on the pregnancy-induced vulnerabilities in innate immunity that contribute to the disproportionately high maternal mortality observed in the following acute viral infections: Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease (EVD), dengue fever, hepatitis E, influenza, and novel coronavirus infections.","output":"Innate Immune Responses to Acute Viral Infection During Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perhaps when China reported its first cases of the novel coronavirus in December 2019, few would predict that it would overwhelm the majority of the global community.

With its prominent focus in the EST volunteering literature (see Lis and Tomaneks chapter of this Handbook), and its inherent travel requirement, the future of volunteer tourism is also discussed. This chapter references other chapters from the Handbook, linking key debates and topics where possible. It draws on generic and sector specific themes to support discussion about where volunteering lies in relation to paid work and unpaid work and briefly touches on its boundaries with leisure. The chapter concludes that the EST sectors will continue post-COVID as essential to the physical and mental well-being of communities.

People living in Puerto Rico face significant levels of poverty, a deficient infrastructure, a fragile healthcare system and the continuing dismantling of the public education system as well as hazardous environmental exposures. The treatment of Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens due to the federal policies of the U.S. government and also the mismanagement of funds from local authorities impacts the prevalence of chronic health conditions and vulnerability to disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and pandemics. Puerto Rico's health disparities are rooted in historical, cultural, political and economic factors that have an impact on biology, interpersonal and environmental aspects. In order to significantly reduce health disparities, systemic change is needed at a local, national and federal level. Interventions must consider how social determinants impact the quality of life and seek to impact the intersections of different contexts that have an effect at an individual, interpersonal, communal and societal level. This can be achieved through evidence-based, culturally appropriate and community based as well as translational research approaches that seek to impact behavior and social economic factors.","output":"Health Disparities Research Framework Adaptation to Reflect Puerto Rico's Socio-Cultural Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombosis is a recognized complication of Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and is often associated with poor prognosis.

We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms, by which some of these variants may contribute to disease, are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of infection among HCW in medical disciplines with AGP. DesignA nationwide questionnaire-based study in in- and outpatient settings was conducted between 12/16/2020 and 01/24/2021. Data on SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCW and potential risk factors were investigated. Results2,070 healthcare facilities with 25,113 employees were included in the study. Despite a higher rate of pre-interventional testing, clinics treated three times more confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases than private practices (28.8% vs. 88.4%, p<0.001). Overall infection rate among HCW accounted for 4.7%. Multivariate analysis revealed that ZIP-regions having comparably higher incidences were significantly associated with increased risk of infection. Furthermore, clinical setting and the GIE specialty have more than double the risk of infection (OR 2.63; 95% CI 2.501-2.817, p<0.01 and OR 2.35; 95% CI 2.245-2.498, p<0.01). The number of procedures performed per day was also significantly associated with an increased risk of infection (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.007-1.014), p<0.01). No treatment of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases was tending to lower the risk of infection (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.507-1.025, p=0.068).

Archived blood for each dyad from maternal enrollment, later in pregnancy, postpartum, and from children at 9-12 years comprised 132 specimens. Multiplex microbead immunoassays were used to quantify vitamin D-binding protein (D), adiponectin (A), retinol-binding protein 4 (R), C-reactive protein (C), and leptin (L). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct variance patterns, i.e. principal components (PC), for baseline pregnancy, bp.pc1.DAR and bp.pc2.CL; combined follow-up during pregnancy and postpartum, dp-pp.pc1.DARL and dp-pp.pc2.ACL; and children, ch.pc1.DRC and ch.pc2.DAL. Maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation led to an association of baseline maternal bp.pc2.CL with decreased post-supplementation maternal dp-pp.pc2.ACL (p = 0.022), which was in turn associated with both increased child ch.pc1.DRC (p = 0.036) and decreased child BMI z-score (BMIZ) (p = 0.022). Further analyses revealed an association between maternal dp-pp.pc1.DARL and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.036). Child ch.pc1.DRC was associated with decreased birth weight (p = 0.036) and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.002).

These three groups might have originated from avian viruses and drifted out independently. Genome shifts occurred occasionally among swine viruses; however, distances between avian and swine/human viruses negated the existence of direct shifts from avian viruses. In humans, only one or two viruses appeared each year, which suggests the presence of competition among viruses that migrated freely. All segments drifted continuously under certain rules and constant velocity. Viruses that had caused an outbreak did not appear again over subsequent decades, which may mean populations had become immune to such viruses.

The question is the extent to which these changes in neighborhood conditions have impacted the sleep quality of residents. In this paper, we use original survey data from the 2021 Crime, Health, and Politics Survey (CHAPS), a national probability sample of adults living in the U.S., to formally test whether changes in perceptions of neighborhood dangerousness during the pandemic are associated with sleep quality during the same period. Regression analyses show that while reports of a neighborhood becoming safer during the pandemic are associated with better sleep quality, reports of a neighborhood becoming more dangerous are associated with worse sleep quality. Mediation analyses also indicate that the association between increased neighborhood dangerousness and poorer sleep quality is partially explained by a concurrent deterioration in diet quality, but not increases in alcohol or cigarette consumption.

Total RNA isolated from the lymphoid organ, gills and haemocytes of P. monodon with moderate infections gave comparable amplicon yields in the RT-PCR step of the test. However, in prawns with extremely low-level infections, haemocytes and gill tissue proved slightly more reliable in detecting MoV RNA following nested PCR. The distribution of MoV in tissues of healthy and moribund P. monodon was examined by in situ hybridisation (ISH) using a digoxigenin-labelled DNA probe to a approximately 0.8 kb M RNA segment cDNA insert in clone pMoV4.1. The DNA probe targeted a region in the MoV M RNA segment containing a coding sequence with homology to the C-terminus of the G2 glycoprotein of phleboviruses. In healthy prawns harbouring an unapparent MoV infection, ISH signal primarily occurred in the lymphoid organ, where it was more prominent in hypertrophied cells of 'spheroids' than within cells of normal tubules. ISH signal was also sometimes detected in cells of cuticular epithelium, segmental nerve ganglion and the antennal and tegmental glands.

We investigated whether medically indicated EEGs performed in acutely ill patients under investigation (PUIs) for COVID\\\\19 report epileptiform abnormalities and whether these are more prevalent in COVID\\\\19 positive than negative patients. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, adult COVID\\\\19 inpatient PUIs underwent EEGs for acute encephalopathy and/or seizure\\\\like events. PUIs had 8\\\\channel headband EEGs (Ceribell; 20 COVID\\\\19 positive, 6 COVID\\\\19 negative); 2 more COVID\\\\19 patients had routine EEGs. Overall, 26 Ceribell EEGs, 4 routine and 7 continuous EEG studies were reviewed. EEGs were interpreted by board\\\\certified clinical neurophysiologists (n = 16). EEG findings were correlated with demographic data, clinical presentation and history, and medication usage. Fisher's exact test was used. RESULTS: We included 28 COVID\\\\19 PUIs (30\\\\83 years old), of whom 22 tested positive (63.6% males) and 6 tested negative (33.3% male). The most common indications for EEG, among COVID\\\\19\\\\positive vs COVID\\\\19\\\\negative patients, respectively, were new onset encephalopathy (68.2% vs 33.3%) and seizure\\\\like events (14/22, 63.6%; 2/6, 33.3%), even among patients without prior history of seizures (11/17, 64.7%; 2/6, 33.3%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included patients planned for intravitreal injections who did not complete the planned course before the lockdown (ie, before 20th of March 2020). Data included demographics, indication for the intravitreal injection, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and central macular thickness on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) before and after the lockdown. RESULTS: One-hundred and sixty-six eyes of 125 patients were studied, 68 (54.4%) patients were males, and the mean ( standard deviation, SD) age was 64.79 (9.41) years. Mean (SD) duration of delay in the planned injection was 60.97 (24.35) days. The change in visual acuity was statistically significant for patients with diabetic macular edema (p= 0.045 improvement), patients with central retinal vein thrombosis (CRVO) (p= 0.05 deterioration), and patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (p= 0.005 deterioration). Of interest, delay of more than 2 months and the previous need for 3 or more injections were significant poor prognostic factors for visual outcome for patients with diabetic macular edema (p=0.027 and 0.045). CONCLUSION: The impact of delay in the scheduled intravitreal injections resulted in variable outcomes depending on the indication. Triaging the urgency of patients should be based on the indication to support the equity principle of bioethics, where those in need are prioritized against others, depending on potential adverse outcome.","output":"Delayed Intravitreal Anti-VEGF Therapy for Patients During the COVID-19 Lockdown: An Ethical Endeavor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many COVID-19 patients developed prolonged symptoms after the infection, including fatigue, delirium, and headache.

However, fuzzy rRT-PCR readouts with high Ct values are frequently encountered, resulting in uncertainty in diagnosis. METHODS: A Specific Enhancer for PCR-amplified Nucleic Acid (SENA) was developed based on the Cas12a trans-cleavage activity, which is specifically triggered by the rRT-PCR amplicons of the SARS-CoV-2 Orf1ab (O) and N fragments. SENA was first characterized to determine its sensitivity and specificity, using a systematic titration experiment with pure SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards, and was then verified in several hospitals, employing a couple of commercial rRT-PCR kits and testing various clinical specimens under different scenarios. FINDINGS: The ratio (10 min/5 min) of fluorescence change (FC) with mixed SENA reaction (mix-FCratio) was defined for quantitative analysis of target O and N genes, and the Limit of Detection (LoD) of mix-FCratio with 95% confidence interval was 1.2&#8804;1.6&#8804;2.1. Totally, 295 clinical specimens were analyzed, among which 21 uncertain rRT-PCR cases as well as 4 false negative and 2 false positive samples were characterized by SENA and further verified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The cut-off values for mix-FCratio were determined as 1.145 for positive and 1.068 for negative. INTERPRETATION: SENA increases both the sensitivity and the specificity of rRT-PCR, solving the uncertainty problem in COVID-19 diagnosis and thus providing a simple and low-cost companion diagnosis for combating the pandemic.

Using SIGN methodology, evidence-based guidelines were developed for utilizing virtual surgical education within the cognitive and curricula, psychomotor, and faculty development domains. OBJECTIVE To identify, categorize, and evaluate the quality of literature, and to provide evidence-based guidelines on virtual surgical education within the cognitive and curricula, psychomotor, and faculty development domains. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA During the COVID-19 Pandemic, utilizing virtual learning modalities is expanding rapidly. While the innovative methods must be considered to bridge the surgical education gap, a framework is needed to avoid expansion of virtual education without proper supporting evidence in some areas. METHODS The Association for Surgical Education formed an ad-hoc research group to evaluate the quality and methodology of the current literature on virtual education and to build evidence-based guidelines by utilizing the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) methodology. We identified PICO-style questions, conducted systematic literature reviews using PubMed, Embase, and ERIC databases. Then we formulated evidence-based recommendations, assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE, NOS-E and Kirkpatrick ratings, and conducted Delphi consensus to validate the recommendations. RESULTS Eleven PICO-style questions were designed by the expert committees. After screening 4723 articles by the review committee, 241 articles met inclusion criteria for full article reviews, and 166 studies were included and categorized into three domains: cognition and curricula (n = 92), psychomotor, (n = 119) and faculty development (n = 119). Sixteen evidence-based recommendations were formulated and validated by an external expert panel. CONCLUSION The evidence-based guidelines developed using SIGN methodology, provide a set of recommendations for surgical training societies, training programs, and educators on utilizing virtual surgical education and highlights the area of needs for further investigation.","output":"Evidence-based Guidelines on the Use of Virtual Surgical Education Pertaining to the Domains of Cognition and Curriculum, Psychomotor Skills Training, and Faculty Development and Mentorship."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, the removal of hazardous pollutants from many industries has become a significant challenge for mankind as a growing number of contaminants, including a wide range of organic pollutants, synthetic dyes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have inevitably led to an increased anthropogenic impact on the biosphere. Due to the complex aromatic structure, most synthetic dyes show resistance to degrade by the classical approaches, such as coagulation, flotation, adsorption, membrane process, and reverse osmosis. Enzyme-assisted biodegradation of pollutants offers an eco-friendlier and cost-effective alternative to remediate dyes, dyes-based effluents, other toxins, etc. Various plant and microbial oxidoreductase (Horseradish and manganese peroxidase) have recently received more attention for degrading and detoxifying a wide range of dyes either by opening the aromatic ring structure or by precipitation due to their high activity under milder conditions, high substrate specificity, and biodegradable nature. To enhance the efficiency, stability and recyclability, enzymes were immobilized on various support media such as sodium alginate, agarose, chitin/chitosan, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, macroporous exchange resins, hydrophobic sol-gels, and nanoporous silica gel, including magnetically separatable media. Among various types of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles, such as hematite, magnetite, and maghemite, have gained great attention due to their properties like small size, superparamagnetism, high surface area to volume ratio, and ease of separation for repeated cycles of uses. These carriers can be separated easily and rapidly from the reaction medium by an external magnetic field without being subjected to mechanical stress than centrifugation or filtration. Various methods have been employed for immobilizing oxidoreductase on different media, such as adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, and encapsulation using different cross-linking agents. Compared to the free enzyme, insolubilized enzymes reduce production costs by enzyme reusability, tolerance to unfavorable environmental conditions, and high catalytic stability. Here, we review various immobilization methods and biocatalytic degradation of emerging dye pollutants, focusing on various non-magnetically and magnetically responsive supports to immobilize peroxidases. Conclusively, magnetically separatable peroxidases show more stability towards extreme temperature and pH conditions and can be used for repeated cycles than free and non-magnetically separatable peroxidase.","output":"Non-magnetic and magnetically responsive support materials immobilized peroxidases for biocatalytic degradation of emerging dye pollutants-A review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate parents willingness to vaccinate their children under the age of 18 with a COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia from January 2021 to March 2021. The univariate analysis using MannCWhitney U-test, t-test, and chi-squared/Fishers exact test was performed to identify sociodemographic factors associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in children. Factors with statistical significance (p < 0.05) were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis to determine the variables affecting parents decisions to vaccinate children. Results: Overall, 44% (167) of parents reported that they would accept vaccinating their children with a COVID-19 vaccine. Young (86; 22.7%), married (135; 35.6%), and Saudi (114; 30%) parents seemed to be more concerned about their children being infected. Parents who intended to vaccinate themselves (OR: 0.599, 95% CI: 0.367C0.980) and who trust the healthcare system (OR: 0.527, 95% CI: 0.327C0.848) reported greater acceptance of childrens vaccination. Among parents, the most frequent (40.9%) reason for vaccinating children was to prevent infection in other family members. What may underlie this result is that some parents understand that children can carry pathogens from persons in school to thoseat home. The most frequent (22.2%) reason for refusing vaccination was concerns about the side effects of the vaccine. Conclusions: Parents have differing opinions on frequencies and risks of coronavirus disease transmission and medical complications and of effectiveness and adverse effects of a vaccine. These results could be of use in designing public health information campaigns and health promotion programs based on perceived parental behavior and positive attitudes.","output":"Parents Willingness to Vaccinate Children against COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted important needs in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services and standard practices for infection prevention and control in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the availability of WASH and standard precautions for infection prevention in health facilities across 18 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as inequalities by location (rural/urban) and managing authority (public/private). Data from health facility surveys conducted between 2013 and 2018 in 18 sub-Saharan African countries were used to estimate the access to an improved water source within 500 m, an improved toilet, soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub, and standard precautions for infection prevention at health facilities. Rural-urban differences and public-private differences in access to services were calculated. We also compared population level access to health facility access to services. RESULT: Overall, 16,456 health facilities from 18 countries were included. Across countries, an estimated 88 % had an improved water source, 94 % had an improved toilet, 74 % had soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub, and 17 % had standard precautions for infection prevention available. There was wide variability in access to water, sanitation and hygiene services between rural and urban health facilities and between public and private facilities, with consistently lower access in both rural and public facilities. In both rural and urban areas, access to water, sanitation and hygiene services was ubiquitously better at health facilities than households. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of WASH services in health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa has improved but remains below the global target of 80 % in many countries. Ensuring adequate access to WASH services and enforcing adherence to safety and hygiene practices in health facilities will be essential to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Access to water, sanitation and hygiene services in health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa 2013C2018: Results of health facility surveys and implications for COVID-19 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For Assmann, repairing the \\"Modern Time Regime\\" must concern the recentring of three elements in society: culture, identity and memory In a world still reeling from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Assmann's advocation that such a reconfiguration become 'not the task of individual theorists of time but of society as a whole' (p 229) has never sounded more urgent Book Review: Aleida Assmann: Is Time out of Joint?

Hence, many nations worldwide have mandated physical-distancing measures. In the current preregistered research, we focus on examining two factors that may help explain differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors and policy support across different countriespolitical orientation and analytic thinking. We positioned our research within the dual-process framework of human reasoning and investigated the role of cognitive reflection, open-minded thinking, and political ideology in determining COVID-19 responsible behavior (physical distancing and maintaining hygiene) and support for restrictive COVID-19 policies on a sample of 12,490 participants from 17 countries. We have not been able to detect substantial relationships of political orientation with preventive behaviors and policy support, and overall found no reliable evidence of politicization, nor polarization regarding the issue. The results of structural equation modeling showed that the inclination towards COVID-19 preventive measures and their endorsement were defined primarily by the tendency of open-minded thinking. Specifically, open-minded thinking was shown to be a predictor of all three criteriaavoiding physical contact, maintaining physical hygiene, and supporting COVID-19 restrictive mitigation policies. Cognitive reflection was predictive of lesser adherence to stricter hygiene and only very weakly predictive of lesser policy support. Furthermore, there was no evidence of these effects varying across political contexts. The mediation analysis suggested a partial mediation effect of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs on the relationships of open-mindedness and cognitive reflection with physical distancing (but not adherence to stricter hygiene) and COVID-19 policy support, albeit very small and significant primarily due to sample size. There was also no evidence of these effects varying across political contexts. Finally, we have not been able to find strong evidence of political orientation modifying the relationship between analytical thinking and COVID-19 behaviors and policy support, although we explored the pattern of these effects in the US and Canadian samples for exploratory purposes and comparison with other similar studies.","output":"Analytic Thinking and Political Orientation in the Corona Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective treatments specific for COVID-19 are still lacking.

No significant change was observed for erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. Interest towards most phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors decreased significantly during lockdown (e.g., sildenafil, p = 0.0002;tadalafil p = 0.0016), then reverted to pre-lockdown levels (e.g., sildenafil, p &lt;0.0001;tadalafil p &lt;0.0001), mirroring a concomitant sales decrement (p = 0.0292).

This article critically evaluates the spatiotemporal morphological variations due to erosion, accretion, and subsurface deformation of the island through multi-temporal geospatial and geophysical data analysis, groundwater quality-quantity, and also determines the nature and rate of changes from 2003 to 2020. This is the first study in this island on which multi-temporal Landsat Satellite Imagery and seismic data have been used with geospatial techniques with Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) and petrel platform, respectively. The analysis of satellite images suggests that the island first appeared in 2003 in the Bay of Bengal, then progressively evolved to the present stable condition. Significant changes have taken place in the morphological and geographical conditions of the island since its inception. Since 2012, the island has been constantly accreted by insignificant erosion. It receives tidally influenced fluvial sediments from the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river system and the sedimentary accretion, in this case, is higher than the erosion due to relatively weaker wave action and longshore currents. It has gained approximately 68 km2 area, mostly in the northern part and because of erosion in the south. Although the migration of the Bhasan Char was ubiquitous during 2003C2012, it has been concentrated in a small area to the east since 2018. The net shoreline movements (NSM) suggest that the length of the shoreline enlarged significantly by around 39 km in 2020 from its first appearance. Seismic and GPS data clearly indicate that the island is located on the crest of a slowly uplifting low-amplitude anticline, which may result in a stable landform around the island. Based on the analysis of historical data, it has been assessed that the current configuration of Bhasan Char would not be severely affected by 10C15-foot-high cyclone. Therefore, FDMN rehabilitation here might be safer that would be a good example for future geo-environmental assessment for any areas around the world for rehabilitation of human in remote and vulnerable island. The findings of this research will facilitate the governments decision to rehabilitate FDMN refugees to the island and also contribute to future research in this area.","output":"The Stability and

treatment of cancer, with technologies that combine therapy with imaging diagnostic tools in the so-called nanotheranostics. Among the most studied systems, there are quantum dots, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, dendrimers, and gold nanoparticles. Most of the advantages of nanomaterials over the classic anticancer therapies come from their optimal size, which prevents the elimination by the kidneys and enhances their permeation in the tumor due to the abnormal blood vessels present in cancer tissues. Furthermore, the drug delivery and the contrast efficiency for imaging are enhanced, especially due to the increased surface area and the selective accumulation in the desired tissues.

Our previous research showed that TGEV infection could induce mitochondrial dysfunction and upregulate miR-222 level. Therefore, we presumed that miR-222 might be implicated in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction induced by TGEV infection. To verify the hypothesis, the effect of miR-222 on mitochondrial dysfunction was tested and we showed that miR-222 attenuated TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-222 in TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, a quantitative proteomic analysis of PK-15 cells that were transfected with miR-222 mimics and infected with TGEV was performed. In total, 4151 proteins were quantified and 100 differentially expressed proteins were obtained (57 upregulated, 43 downregulated), among which thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) and cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) were downregulated. THBS1 was identified as the target of miR-222. Knockdown of THBS1 and CD47 decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ level and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level. Reversely, overexpression of THBS1 and CD47 elevated mitochondrial Ca2+ level and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the frequency and co-occurrence of new diagnoses consistent with postsepsis morbidity and mortality as well as new nursing care dependency and total health care costs after sepsis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study based on nationwide health claims data included a population-based cohort of 23.0 million beneficiaries of a large German health insurance provider. Patients aged 15 years and older with incident hospital-treated sepsis in 2013 to 2014 were included. Data were analyzed from January 2009 to December 2017. EXPOSURES: Sepsis, identified by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) hospital discharge codes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: New medical, psychological, and cognitive diagnoses; long-term mortality; dependency on nursing care; and overall health care costs in survivors at 1 to 12, 13 to 24, and 25 to 36 months after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Among 23.0 million eligible individuals, we identified 159 684 patients hospitalized with sepsis in 2013 to 2014. The mean (SD) age was 73.8 (12.8) years, and 75 809 (47.5%; 95% CI, 47.2%-47.7%) were female patients. In-hospital mortality was 27.0% (43 177 patients; 95% CI, 26.8%-27.3%). Among 116 507 hospital survivors, 86 578 (74.3%; 95% CI, 74.1%-74.6%) had a new diagnosis in the first year post sepsis; 28 405 (24.4%; 95% CI, 24.1%-24.6%) had diagnoses co-occurring in medical, psychological, or cognitive domains; and 23 572 of 74 878 survivors (31.5%; 95% CI, 31.1%-31.8%) without prior nursing care dependency were newly dependent on nursing care. In total, 35 765 survivors (30.7%; 95% CI, 30.4%-31.0%) died within the first year. In the second and third year, 53 089 (65.8%; 95% CI, 65.4%-66.1%) and 40 959 (59.4%; 95% CI, 59.0%-59.8%) had new diagnoses, respectively. Health care costs for sepsis hospital survivors for 3 years post sepsis totaled a mean of 29 088/patient ($32 868/patient) (SD, 44 195 [$49 938]). New postsepsis morbidity (>1 new diagnosis) was more common in survivors of severe sepsis (75.6% [95% CI, 75.1%-76.0%]) than nonsevere sepsis (73.7% [95% CI, 73.4%-74.0%]; P < .001) and more common in survivors treated in the intensive care unit (78.3% [95% CI, 77.8%-78.7%]) than in those not treated in the intensive care unit (72.8% [95% CI, 72.5%-73.1%]; P < .001). Postsepsis morbidity was 68.5% (95% CI, 67.5%-69.5%) among survivors without prior morbidity and 56.1% (95% CI, 54.2%-57.9%) in survivors younger than 40 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, new medical, psychological, and cognitive diagnoses consistent with postsepsis morbidity were common after sepsis, including among patients with less severe sepsis, no prior diagnoses, and younger age. This calls for more efforts to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, define optimal screening for common new diagnoses, and test interventions to prevent and treat postsepsis morbidity.","output":"Epidemiology and Costs of Postsepsis Morbidity, Nursing Care Dependency, and Mortality in Germany, 2013 to 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To study the profile of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in the Unified Health System (SUS) in Brazil and to identify factors associated with hospital mortality related to the disease. Methods: Cross-sectional study, based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations that occurred in SUS, between the last days of February and June. Patients aged 18 years or older, with primary or secondary diagnoses indicative of COVID-19 were included. Bivariate analyses were performed and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were estimated with random effects intercept. The modeling followed three steps, including: attributes of the patients; elements of the care process; and characteristics of the hospital and place of hospitalization. Results: 89,405 hospitalizations were observed, of which 24.4% resulted in death. COVID-19 patients hospitalized in SUS were predominantly male (56.5%), with a mean age of 58.9 years. The length of stay ranged from less than 24 hours to 114 days, with a mean of 6.9 (STD=6.5) days. Of the total number of hospitalizations, 22.6% reported ICU use. The chances of hospital death among men were 16.8% higher than among women and increased with age. Black individuals had a higher chance of death. The behavior of the Charlson and Elixhauser indices was consistent with the hypothesis of a higher risk of death among patients with comorbidities, and obesity had an independent effect on increasing this risk. Some states had a higher risk of hospital death from COVID-19, such as Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro. The chances of hospital death were 72.1% higher in municipalities with at least 100,000 inhabitants and being hospitalized in the municipality of residence was a protective factor. Conclusion: There was wide variation in hospital COVID-19 mortality in the SUS, associated with demographic and clinical factors, social inequality and differences in the structure of services and quality of health care.","output":"COVID-19 hospitalizations in Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is caused by a virus that predominantly replicates in alveolar macrophages. The aim of the present study was to characterize the production of cytokines by subpopulations of pulmonary macrophages in pigs infected by the PRRS virus (PRRSV). Expression of interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- correlated with the severity of pulmonary pathology and the numbers of pulmonary macrophages. Significant correlations were observed between PRRSV infection and the expression of IL-10, between the expression of IL-12p40 and interferon (IFN)-, and between the expression of TNF- and IFN-. These findings suggest that PRRSV modulates the immune response by the up-regulation of IL-10, which may in turn reduce expression of cytokines involved in viral clearance (e.g. IFN-, IFN-, IL-12p40 and TNF-). The results also suggest that expression of IFN- is stimulated by IL-12p40 and TNF-, but not by IFN-. All of these cytokines were expressed mainly by septal macrophages with weaker expression by alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. There appears to be differential activation of septal and alveolar macrophages in PRRSV infection, with septal macrophages being the major source of cytokines.","output":"Cytokine Expression by Macrophages in the Lung of Pigs Infected with the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Properties of city-level commuting networks are expected to influence epidemic potential of cities and modify the speed and spatial trajectory of epidemics when they occur.

We model the dynamics of directly-transmitted infections (such as SARS-CoV2) propagating on these commuting networks, and find that differences in network structure between the two cities drive divergent predicted epidemic trajectories: the commuting network in Bangkok is composed of geographically-contiguous modular communities and epidemic dispersal is correlated with geographic distance between locations, whereas the network in Dhaka has less distinct geographic structure and epidemic dispersal is less constrained by geographic distance. We also find that the predicted dynamics of epidemics vary depending on the local topology of the network around the origin of the outbreak.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant shift towards trial delivery without in-person face-to-face contact or Remote Trial Delivery. The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) assembled a Remote Trial Delivery Working Group to consider challenges and enablers to this major change in clinical trial delivery and to provide a toolkit for researchers to support the transition to remote delivery. METHODS: The NIHR Remote Trial Delivery Working Group evaluated five key domains of the trial delivery pathway: participant factors, recruitment, intervention delivery, outcome measurement and quality assurance. Independent surveys were disseminated to research professionals, and patients and carers, to ascertain benefits, challenges, pitfalls, enablers and examples of good practice in Remote Trial Delivery. A toolkit was constructed to support researchers, funders and governance structures in moving towards Remote Trial Delivery. The toolkit comprises a website encompassing the key principles of Remote Trial Delivery, and a repository of best practice examples and questions to guide research teams. RESULTS: The patient and carer survey received 47 respondents, 34 of whom were patients and 13 of whom were carers. The professional survey had 115 examples of remote trial delivery practice entered from across England. Key potential benefits included broader reach and inclusivity, the ability for standardisation and centralisation, and increased efficiency and patient/carer convenience. Challenges included the potential exclusion of participants lacking connectivity or digital skills, the lack of digitally skilled workforce and appropriate infrastructure, and validation requirements. Five key principles of Remote Trial Delivery were proposed: national research standards, inclusivity, validity, cost-effectiveness and evaluation of new methodologies. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid changes towards Remote Trial Delivery catalysed by the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to sustained change in clinical trial delivery.

While the INC mechanism has been well developed recently, few investigations have focused on rigid nanoplatelets because of the inherent steric hindrance of the surface-grafted polymer chains. Herein, surface-modified rigid nanoplatelets have been incorporated into an immiscible poly(l-lactide) (PLLA)/poly(butylene succinate) (PBSU) blend. It is demonstrated that the strong interfacial adhesion between PLLA and PBSU phases is promoted via molecular entanglements of the grafted chains on the surface of nanoplatelets with the individual components. A refined phase morphology with improved mechanical properties can be achieved with the addition of 5 wt % modified Gibbsite nanoplatelets. It was further found that the stiffness of nanoplatelets can change the geometry of the interface significantly. It is, therefore, indicated that the simultaneous interface strengthening and interfacial curvature controlling of rigid nanoplatelets originate from the selective swelling/collapse of the in situ-formed PLLA and PBSU grafts within the corresponding phase at the interface. Such a mechanism is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations.

METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 25 to December 1, 2020, where travel data were acquired and converted to emission data. RESULTS: 5,137 kg of GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents were prevented by managing isotretinoin virtually during the study period. 49 400 kg of GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents would be prevented annually. This is the emission load released when 24 690 kg of coal are burned. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental impact studies in the field of dermatology remain limited. GHG emissions were significantly reduced by virtually managing isotretinoin at a single institution. The practice of dermatology could reduce its carbon footprint by managing isotretinoin virtually, even in non-pandemic periods.

Study inclusion criteria were the following: 5 overweight or obese adult patients undergoing intragastric balloon placement, with liver tests [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)] or markers of NAFLD (e.g., imaging, biopsy) reported before balloon insertion and after balloon removal at 6 months. RESULTS Nine observational studies and one randomized trial were identified. ALT decreased by -10.02 U/l (95 % CI, -13.2, -6.8), GGT decreased by -9.82 U/l (95 % CI, -12.9, -6.8), and BMI decreased by -4.98 kg/m(2) (-5.6, -4.4) with IGB therapy.

METHODS: Florida county COVID-19 infection and vaccination counts through September 2021 were supplemented with socioeconomic characteristics and 2020 presidential election results. Poisson regression measured the association of infection and vaccination rates with county political preferences, race, ethnicity, and other county demographic and economic characteristics. For models of April through September 2021 infection rates, the same county characteristics were assessed alongside county vaccination levels. RESULTS: Each 1% increase in county full vaccination rates was associated with 82.47 fewer infections per 100 000 during the span of April to September 2021. Vaccination rate was the largest and most statistically significant determinant of vaccine era infections. Each 1% increase in the county share of votes for the 2020 Republican presidential candidate was associated with 109.7 more COVID-19 infections per 100 000 through March 2021 and a 0.546% decrease in county vaccination rates through September 2021.

It has been suggested that this abrupt lockdown of populations will foster addiction-related habits such as caloric/salty food intake, screen use, and substance use. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the global changes and factors of increase in addiction-related habits during the early COVID-19 containment phase in France. METHODS: A web-based survey was provided from day 8 to day 13 of the containment and was completed by 11,391 participants. The questions explored sociodemographic features, psychiatric/addiction history, material conditions of lockdown, general stress, mental well-being, and reported changes in several addiction-related behaviors. Global changes were described and factors of increase were explored using population-weighted and adjusted logistic regression models, providing adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Overall, the respondents reported more increases in addiction-related habits than decreases, specifically 28.4% (caloric/salty food intake), 64.6% (screen use), 35.6% (tobacco use), 24.8% (alcohol use), and 31.2% (cannabis use). Reduced well-being scores and increased stress scores were general factors of increase in addiction-related habits (P<.001 for all habits). Factors of increase in caloric/salty food intake (n=10,771) were female gender (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.77), age less than 29 years (P<.001), having a partner (aOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), being locked down in a more confined space (per 1 square meter/person decrease: aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), being locked down alone (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49), and reporting current (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62-2.31) or past (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.47) psychiatric treatment. Factors of increase in screen use (n=11,267) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.21-1.43), age less than 29 years (P<.001), having no partner (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32), being employed (P<.001), intermediate/high education level (P<.001), being locked down with no access to an outdoor space (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29), being locked down alone (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32), living in an urban environment (P<.01), and not working (P<.001). Factors of increase in tobacco use (n=2787) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55), having no partner (aOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.59), intermediate/low education level (P<.01), and still working in the workplace (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.17-1.86).

Little is known on the frequency and the nature of persistent symptoms beyond 3 months. Here we have assessed, in the longitudinal prospective French COVID-19 cohort, symptoms that persisted 6 months after admission for COVID-19. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Follow-up was planned with a physician's visit at month (M)3 and M6 after admission. Associations between persistence of symptoms at M6 and clinical characteristics at admission were assessed through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: M6 data were available for 1137 participants. Median age was 61 years (IQR 51C71) and 288 (29%, 95% CI 26C32%) were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) during the acute phase. Six hundred and fifty-five (68%, 95% CI 65C71%) and 639 (60%, 95% CI 57C63%) participants had at least one symptom at M3 and M6 visit, respectively, mostly fatigue, dyspnoea, joint pain and myalgia. At M6, 255 (24%, 95% CI 21C27%) of participants had three or more persistent symptoms. The presence of three or more symptoms at M6 was independently associated with female gender (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.40, 95% CI 1.75C3.30), having three or more symptoms at admission (aOR 2.04, 95% CI 1.45C2.89) and ICU admission/transfer during acute phase (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.09C2.18), but not significantly with age or having two or more comorbidities. One hundred and twenty-five (29%, 95% CI 25C34%) of those who initially had a professional occupation were not back to work at M6.

Thus, for identifying n different viruses, we need n different probes. Recently, some researchers study non-unique probes to identify viruses by using less number of probes. In this case, a virus can be identified by a combination of some probes. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a set of probes that can identify all the given targets. We consider the k-fault tolerance selection of probes. That is, if any k probes fail, then we still can identify each target.

The characterization of synthesized nZVI particles was obtained by XRD, SEM, EDX, and TG analyses. The results demonstrated that the nZVI particles have a spherical shape, mean crystalline size of 44.43 nm, and exhibited a good chemical and thermal stability performance under different physical conditions. The bacterial suspensions were subjected to the treatment using nZVI particle suspensions with a concentration of 10 mg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration of nZVI particles was determined using the well diffusion assay method and found to be 15, 10, 10, and 5 mg for the following four strains; S. aureus, B. subtilus, E. coli, and Ps. aeruginosa, respectively. The biological treatment results of municipal wastewater using nZVI particles revealed that the counts of total bacteria, total coliform, fecal coliform, S. aureus, fecal Streptococcus, and E. coli were decreased to 44.29%, 51.76%, 90.95%, 46.67%, 33.33%, and 93.89%, respectively, while the Ps. aeruginosa not detected in the wastewater sample. The enhanced inactivation performance of nZVI nanoparticles was mainly attributed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, releasing of iron corrosion products like Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) ions, and direct friction of nZVI particles with bacterial cells membranes. In addition, the nZVI particles presented a striking disinfection behavior in comparison with other widespread disinfection technologies such as chlorination.

The main objective of our study was to compare the variability of surgical and emergency consultation activity amongst two hand trauma centers, between the pandemic period and outside the pandemic period. The secondary objective was to identify at-risk patients in order to develop preventative strategies in hand trauma. Methods: This bi-centric retrospective study considered the epidemiology of admissions to trauma centers during the first French lockdown. The data were compared to the same period in 2019 (control group). Two-thousand and fifty-five patients underwent consultations for hand or wrist trauma. Results: The first French lockdown was associated with a 35% decrease in hand and wrist injuries in the COVID-19 zone versus 24% in the non-COVID-19 zone, compared to the same period in 2019 (p<0.0001, 95%CI 6.5-15.6). Comparing 2019 and 2020, the incidence of wounds significantly increased in the COVID-19 zone (58% vs. 78%, p<0.0001) and significantly decreased in the non-COVID-19 zone (55% vs. 50%, p<0.0001). Complex wounds (16% vs. 35%, p<0.0001 and 15% vs 17%, p<0.0001) and open fractures (8% vs. 14%, p=0.019 and 4.5% vs. 5.3%, p< 0.0001) significantly increased in both zones during the pandemic. The rate of male, non-manual workers injured in domestic accidents (76% vs. 36%, p<0.0001) was significantly increased in all areas. Conclusion: Hand and wrist trauma was less frequent but more severe during the pandemic compared to the same period in 2019. By encouraging the public to be aware of the risks and the means to avoid trauma, such as better information and compliance with safety instructions, we could minimize these risks.

The principle of a lateral flow immunoassay strip (LFIAs) consists of fixing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to the surface of the strip and coupling anti-human IgG with colloidal gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). A series of parameters of this method were optimized, including the concentration of coating antigen, BSA blocking concentration and pH value for conjugation. The entire detection process took 15-20 min with a volume of 80 L of the analyte solution containing 10 L of serum and 70 L sample diluent. The performance of the established assay was evaluated using serum samples of the clinically diagnosed cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Whilst coherency and consistency are touted as essentials in public health messaging, our textual analysis highlighted the disconnect between political communication and news media coverage. Whereas the UK government relied on vague references to curves and peaks to underpin a narrative of consistency and certainty in public health policy, the UK news media referred to specific numbers from within and outside the UK to criticise the government's approach as haphazard and lacking. This disconnect gained even more significance during our focus groups. When discussing numbers, participants referred to news media coverage rather than political messaging, using these figures to challenge the timing and nature of the UK lockdown. These findings present a significant critique of the UK government's communication during this health crisis. Instead of putting forward a coherent, homogenous and clear message to the public, the discourse around numbers and risk was diffracted, disconnected and opaque.

Goodness of fit chi-square (2) was used to assess CBD use between codes and player position. Effects of age on use were determined using 2 tests of independence. Twenty-five teams provided 517 player responses. While the majority of players had never used CBD (p < .001, V = 0.24), 26% had either used it (18%) or were still using it (8%).

In vitro studies have demonstrated the redundancy of these two cytokine families which activate the same transcription factor, IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), via distinct ligands and receptors. However, in vivo, these IFN types do have distinct functions based on receptor distribution, but also ligand availability. Using a newly generated IFN- reporter mouse strain we have observed that both type I and type III IFNs are produced in response to respiratory tract infection by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and influenza A virus (IAV). In the case of NDV these IFNs are synthesized by different cell types. Type I IFNs are produced primarily by alveolar macrophages, type III IFNs are made only by epithelial cells, and production of either is dependent on MAVS. While epithelial cells of the respiratory tract represent the primary target of IAV infection, we found that they did not significantly contribute to IFN- production, and IFN- protein levels were largely unaffected in the absence of MAVS. Instead we found that pDCs, a cell type known for robust IFN- production via TLR/MyD88 signaling, were the major producers of IFN- during IAV infection, with pDC depletion during influenza infection resulting in significantly reduced levels of both IFN- and IFN-. In addition, we were able to demonstrate that pDCs rely on type I IFN for optimal IFN- production. These studies therefore demonstrate that the in vivo producers of Type III IFNs in response to respiratory virus infection are pathogen dependent, a finding which may explain the varying levels of cytokine production induced by different viral pathogens.","output":"The In Vivo Source of Type I and Type III IFNs is Pathogen Dependent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many small biological objects, such as viruses, survive in a water environment and cannot remain active in dry air without condensation of water vapor.

However, the process of SARS-CoV-2 adsorption to exposed surfaces in high-risk environments remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the interfacial dynamics of single SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with plasmonic imaging technology. Through the use of this technique, which has high spatial and temporal resolution, we tracked the collision of viruses at a surface and differentiated their stable adsorption and transient adsorption. We determined the effect of the electrostatic force on virus adhesion by correlating the solution and surface chemistry with the interfacial diffusion velocity and equilibrium position. Viral adsorption was found to be enhanced in real scenarios, such as in simulated saliva. This work not only describes a plasmonic imaging method to examine the interfacial dynamics of a single virus but also provides direct measurements of the factors that regulate the interfacial adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.

While this virus has a low fatality rate, the problem is that it is highly infectious, and as a result, it has infected a large number of people, putting a strain on the healthcare system, hence, Covid-19 identification in patients has become critical. The goal of this research is to use X-rays images and computed tomography(CT) images to introduce a deep learning strategy based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect and identify the Covid-19 disease. We have implemented two different classifications using CNN(binary classification and multiclass classification). A total of 3,877 image datasets from CTs and X-rays were utilised to train the model in binary classification, with 1,917 images from Covid-19 infected individuals among them. The experimental results for binary classification show an overall accuracy of 99.64%, recall(or sensitivity) of 99.58%, the precision of 99.56%, F1-score of 99.59%, and ROC of 100%.

Though the pool of ovarian follicles is established during fetal development, impacts of in utero exposures on AMH are uncertain. Thus, we sought to evaluate associations of in utero exposures with AMH of adult daughters with a prospective cohort study of adult daughters at university medical centers. Women noted their mother's reported use of diethylstilbestrol (DES), vitamins, tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine during pregnancy, and their mother's occupation during pregnancy. All participants were reproductive age women (18-40 years) enrolled in the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) trial. Serum AMH concentrations were measured at baseline prior to conception and categorized using clinical guidelines. Multinomial regression models estimated associations between each exposure and high (>3.5 ng/mL) and low (<1.0 ng/mL) versus normal AMH (1.0-3.5 ng/mL), adjusting for participant's age, mother's age, mother's history of fertility treatment, and mother's use of vitamins. In 1202 women with available data, maternal caffeine use was associated with an increased risk of low AMH, compared to normal (relative risk [RR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 3.30).

Patients reported symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, fever. Bilateral infiltrates in the lung parenchyma could be seen in imaging studies. Two years after the diagnosis of the first case of COVID-19, we are confident that symptoms manifest in every organ, including the eyes. Ocular manifestations may result from the COVID- 19 infection itself as well as from associated treatment, including mechanical ventilation or drug therapy. Ocular manifestations may be the first signs of COVID-19, so this knowledge is essential for making a prompt and correct diagnosis. It is important to be aware of the risks associated with the possibility of infection during the ophthalmic examination of these patients. AIM The aim of the analysis was to perform a literature review systematizing the knowledge on ocular manifestations in the course of the COVID-19 infection with particular emphasis on the relation between the occurrence of ocular symptoms and the age of patients as well as the severity of the COVID-19 course. The review also included studies that evaluated the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in tears or conjunctival sac swabs of patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS Articles for the literature review were collected from the PubMed database. The expression \\"COVID-19 ocular manifestations\\" was used as the selection criteria. Finally, fifteen papers published in 2020 and fifteen papers published in 2021 were included in the review. Nineteen of these were original papers, two were meta-analyses, and nine were classified as review papers. RESULTS The most commonly reported ocular manifestations include dry eye or foreign body sensation, conjunctival hyperaemia, tearing, itching, and eye pain. Conjunctivitis was the most commonly diagnosed ophthalmic disease among COVID-19 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with a risk of a significant decrease in visual acuity due to retinal vascular occlusion, ischemic optic neuropathy, inflammation of the choroid, retina and the optic nerve. The incidence of the most common ocular surface-related symptoms was higher in children than in adults. In several studies it has been shown that patients with more severe COVID-19 infection are more likely to have ocular symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Physicians, especially ophthalmologists, should be aware of the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the possibility of ocular symptoms and should recommend testing for COVID-19 if SARS-CoV-2 infection is suspected to reduce the possibility of infection spread.","output":"[Ocular symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infection]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim An early tracheostomy is often considered for patients with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). However, there is no consensus on the timing of a tracheostomy in patients on VV-ECMO for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present report described the optimal timing of tracheostomy for these patients. Method The present study was a single-center case series. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of nine consecutive patients who underwent tracheostomy either during or after VV-ECMO treatment in our center between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Results All the patients received a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy, which was performed during VV-ECMO in four patients. Three of these patients experienced hemorrhagic complications, and the remaining patient required a circuit change on the day after the operation. Heparin was discontinued 8 h preoperatively and resumed 1?14 h later. The platelet count was below normal in two patients, but no transfusion was performed. APTT was almost normal, and D-dimer was elevated postoperatively. The remaining five patients received a tracheostomy after weaning off VV-ECMO, and no complication was observed. Eight patients were deeply sedated during VV-ECMO to prioritize lung rest and prevent infecting the healthcare workers. Conclusion In the present study, patients who underwent a tracheostomy during VV-ECMO tended to have more hemorrhagic complications. Because an early tracheostomy during ECMO has little benefit for patients with COVID-19, it should be performed after weaning off VV-ECMO to protect the safety of the healthcare workers concerned.","output":"Optimal timing of tracheostomy in patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus 2019: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (officially declared on the March 11, 2020), and the resulting measures, are impacting daily life and medical management of breast cancer patients and survivors We evaluated to what extent these changes have affected quality of life, physical, and psychosocial well-being of patients previously or currently being treated for breast cancer Methods: This study was conducted within a prospective, multicenter cohort of breast cancer patients and survivors (Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaLuAtion) Shortly after the implementation of COVID-19 measures, an extra survey was sent to 1595 participants, including the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core (C30) and breast cancer-specific (BR23) Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared with the most recent PROs collected within UMBRELLA pre-COVID-19 The impact of COVID-19 on PROs was assessed using mixed model analysis, adjusting for potential confounders Results: 1051 patients and survivors (65 9%) completed the survey;31 1% (n = 327) reported a higher threshold to contact their general practitioner amid the COVID-19 pandemic A statistically significant deterioration in emotional functioning was observed (mean = 82 6 [SD = 18 7] to 77 9 [SD = 17 3];P &lt; 001), and 505 (48 0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 45 0% to 51 1%) patients and survivors reported moderate to severe loneliness Small improvements were observed in quality of life and physical, social, and role functioning In the subgroup of 51 patients under active treatment, social functioning strongly deteriorated (77 3 [95% CI = 69 4 to 85 2] to 61 3 [95% CI = 52 6 to 70 1];P = 002) Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast cancer patients and survivors were less likely to contact physicians and experienced a deterioration in their emotional functioning Patients undergoing active treatment reported a substantial drop in social functioning One in 2 reported loneliness that was moderate or severe Online interventions supporting mental health and social interaction are needed during times of social distancing and lockdowns","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patient-Reported Outcomes of Breast Cancer Patients and Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pathological cascade of tissue damage in mild traumatic brain injury is set forth by a perturbation in ionic homeostasis. However, whether this class of injury can be detected in vivo and serve as a surrogate marker of clinical outcome is unknown. We employ sodium MRI to test the hypotheses that regional and global total sodium concentrations: (i) are higher in patients than in controls and (ii) correlate with clinical presentation and neuropsychological function. Given the novelty of sodium imaging in traumatic brain injury, effect sizes from (i), and correlation types and strength from (ii), were compared to those obtained using standard diffusion imaging metrics. Twenty-seven patients (20 female, age 35.9  12.2 years) within 2 months after injury and 19 controls were scanned with proton and sodium MRI at 3 Tesla. Total sodium concentration, fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient were obtained with voxel averaging across 12 grey and white matter regions. Linear regression was used to obtain global grey and white matter total sodium concentrations. Patient outcome was assessed with global functioning, symptom profiles and neuropsychological function assessments. In the regional analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between patients and controls in apparent diffusion coefficient, while differences in sodium concentration and fractional anisotropy were found only in single regions. However, for each of the 12 regions, sodium concentration effect sizes were uni-directional, due to lower mean sodium concentration in patients compared to controls. Consequently, linear regression analysis found statistically significant lower global grey and white matter sodium concentrations in patients compared to controls. The strongest correlation with outcome was between global grey matter sodium concentration and the composite z-score from the neuropsychological testing. In conclusion, both sodium concentration and diffusion showed poor utility in differentiating patients from controls, and weak correlations with clinical presentation, when using a region-based approach. In contrast, sodium linear regression, capitalizing on partial volume correction and high sensitivity to global changes, revealed high effect sizes and associations with patient outcome. This suggests that well-recognized sodium imbalances in traumatic brain injury are (i) detectable non-invasively; (ii) non-focal; (iii) occur even when the antecedent injury is clinically mild. Finally, in contrast to our principle hypothesis, patients sodium concentrations were lower than controls, indicating that the biological effect of traumatic brain injury on the sodium homeostasis may differ from that in other neurological disorders.

It is also considered as the key tool in Corona Virus (COVID-19) battle. Moreover, the conventional approaches with fixed gateways may not work either, and this might lead to decoding errors due to the large distance between mobile nodes and the gateway. To avoid the decoding errors and improve the reliability of the messages, we propose to use intermediate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to transfer messages from ground-based Long Range (LoRa) nodes to the remote base station (BS). Specifically, this UAV-enabled LoRa architecture is based on the ad hoc WiFi network, wherein, UAVs act as relays for the traffic generated between LoRa nodes and BS. To make the architecture more efficient, a distributed topology control algorithm is also proposed for UAVs. The algorithm is based on virtual spring forces and movement prediction technique that periodically updates the UAV topology to adapt to the movement of the ground-based LoRa nodes that move on the surface.

However, the framing of the labour migrants as a danger is only part of the story, and the image of a scapegoat was eventually replaced with images of an economic resource and a victim. Thus, Ukrainian labour migrants have been the object of vilification, heroization, as well as empathy during the various phases of the outbreak.

Diabetic patients awareness regarding how to care for their feet plays a significant role in preventing these complications. Methods A correlation cross-sectional study was conducted targeting all diabetic patients aging 20 years or more. Online questionnaire was used for data collection. Questionnaire was uploaded online using social media platforms by the researchers and their relatives and friends. The questionnaire included patient personal data, patients knowledge regarding diabetic foot, attitude and practice regarding the risk of diabetic foot among diabetic patients. Results A total of 1,000 diabetic patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria completed the study questionnaire. Exact of 77.5% of the patients know that Diabetics can get gangrene in the foot, 74.9% know diabetics can develop ulcers in the foot, 66.7% reported that Diabetes can reduce blood flow to the feet of diabetic patients, 66.6% agreed that diabetic patients can suffer from a lack of sensation in the feet. Exact of 84.5% of the study participants agreed that Diabetics should check for any wounds on their feet daily, 78.7% agreed that Diabetics should visit a doctor when there is any infection or wound in the feet, 76.6% think that diabetic patients should wear specialized shoes to avoid diabetic foot according to the doctor's instructions.

Additionally, a cohort of 234 individuals not included in the model training set were investigated to evaluate the performance of the model. The model achieved the accuracy of 97.8% along with 96.0% precision, 94.8% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity for DM classification based on a diagnosis threshold of 126 mg/dL for diabetes in fasting blood glucose. For non-invasive real-time blood glucose monitoring, the model exhibited  15% error with 95% confidence interval and the detection limit of 60C400 mg/dL, as validated with the standard hexokinase enzymatic method for glucose estimation. In conclusion, this proposed mbNIR based SDNN model with PMF is highly accurate and computationally cheaper compared to similar previous works using complex neural network. Some groups proposed using complicated mixed types of sensors to improve noninvasive glucose prediction accuracy; however, the accuracy gain over the complexity and costs of the systems harvested is still in questioned (Geng et al. in Sci Rep 7:12650, 2017). None of previous works report on accuracy enhancement of NIR/NN using PMF. Therefore, the proposed SDNN over PMF/mbNIR is an extremely promising candidate for the non-invasive real-time blood glucose monitoring with less complexity and pain-free.","output":"Non-invasively accuracy enhanced blood glucose sensor using shallow dense neural networks with NIR monitoring and medical features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] 35) is associated with a broad range of health risks. Bariatric surgery induces weight loss and short-term health improvements, but little is known about long-term outcomes of these operations. OBJECTIVE To report 3-year change in weight and select health parameters after common bariatric surgical procedures. DESIGN AND SETTING The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) Consortium is a multicenter observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS AND EXPOSURE: Adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgical procedures as part of routine clinical care by participating surgeons were recruited between 2006 and 2009 and followed up until September 2012. Participants completed research assessments prior to surgery and 6 months, 12 months, and then annually after surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), we assessed percent weight change from baseline and the percentage of participants with diabetes achieving hemoglobin A1c levels less than 6.5% or fasting plasma glucose values less than 126 mg/dL without pharmacologic therapy. Dyslipidemia and hypertension resolution at 3 years was also assessed. RESULTS At baseline, participants (N = 2458) were 18 to 78 years old, 79% were women, median BMI was 45.9 (IQR, 41.7-51.5), and median weight was 129 kg (IQR, 115-147). For their first bariatric surgical procedure, 1738 participants underwent RYGB, 610 LAGB, and 110 other procedures. At baseline, 774 (33%) had diabetes, 1252 (63%) dyslipidemia, and 1601 (68%) hypertension. Three years after surgery, median actual weight loss for RYGB participants was 41 kg (IQR, 31-52), corresponding to a percentage of baseline weight lost of 31.5% (IQR, 24.6%-38.4%). For LAGB participants, actual weight loss was 20 kg (IQR, 10-29), corresponding to 15.9% (IQR, 7.9%-23.0%). The majority of weight loss was evident 1 year after surgery for both procedures. Five distinct weight change trajectory groups were identified for each procedure. Among participants who had diabetes at baseline, 216 RYGB participants (67.5%) and 28 LAGB participants (28.6%) experienced partial remission at 3 years. The incidence of diabetes was 0.9% after RYGB and 3.2% after LAGB. Dyslipidemia resolved in 237 RYGB participants (61.9%) and 39 LAGB participants (27.1%); remission of hypertension occurred in 269 RYGB participants (38.2%) and 43 LAGB participants (17.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among participants with severe obesity, there was substantial weight loss 3 years after bariatric surgery, with the majority experiencing maximum weight change during the first year. However, there was variability in the amount and trajectories of weight loss and in diabetes, blood pressure, and lipid outcomes.

For the case of COVID-19 spreading in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate which correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions.Thereby, we can (a) quantify the effects of recent governmental measures to mitigating the disease spread, and (b) incorporate analogue change points to forecast future scenarios and case numbers.Our code is freely available and can be readily adapted to any country or region.","output":"Inferring COVID-19 spreading rates and potential change points for case number forecasts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the human coronavirus SARS CoV-2, has led to millions of deaths across the globe. Not only is the SARS CoV-2 virus highly infectious, it also mutates very easily. This creates additional challenges for development of robust therapeutic solutions. Along with modern system of healthcare, there is a definite need for exploring natural plant based antiviral compounds directed against the SARS CoV-2 virus. Objective The present observational study investigates the efficacy of an Ayurvedic polyherbal formulation of 19 ingredients, NOQ19, in the management of COVID-19. Methodology: A single arm, single centric, open label study design was adopted for this feasibility study. 161 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The enrolled participants were provided the Ayurvedic intervention, 2 tablets of NOQ19, thrice daily along with the standard of care treatment. Follow up COVID-19 RT- PCR tests were conducted on Day 5, Day 10 and Day 14, or until the patient turned negative. The time required for testing negative on the RT-PCR test or becoming asymptomatic was noted. Results A subjective analysis demonstrated that 74% of patients turned RT-PCR negative within 5 days of taking NOQ19. Additionally, 98% of the subjects turned RT-PCR Negative on Day 10 after taking NOQ19 in addition to the standard of care treatment of Vitamin C, Zinc and antipyretic (as necessary).

However, as some studies have shown, virions can remain infectious for up to 72 hours on surfaces, which can lead to transmission through contact. For this reason, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end (E2E) study showed that the effective combination of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces include using an Isohelix swab as a collection tool, DNA/RNA Shield as a preservative, an automated system for RNA extraction, and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as the detection assay. Using this E2E approach, this study showed that, in some cases, SARS-CoV-2 viral standards were still recovered from surfaces as detected by RT-qPCR for as long as eight days even after bleach treatment. Additionally, debris associated with specific built environment surfaces appeared to negatively impact the recovery of RNA, with Amerstat inhibition as high as 90% when challenged with an inactivated viral control. Overall, it was determined that this E2E protocol required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm2 to successfully detect virus from test surfaces. When this method was employed to evaluate 368 samples collected from various built environmental surfaces, all samples tested negative, indicating that the surfaces were either void of virus or below the detection limit of the assay.","output":"End-to-End Protocol for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Built Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Code sets play a central role in analytic work with clinical data warehouses, as components of phenotype, cohort, or analytic variable algorithms representing specific clinical phenomena. Code set quality has received critical attention and repositories for sharing and reusing code sets have been seen as a way to improve quality and reduce redundant effort. Nonetheless, concerns regarding code set quality persist. In order to better understand ongoing challenges in code set quality and reuse, and address them with software and infrastructure recommendations, we determined it was necessary to learn how code sets are constructed and validated in real-world settings. Methods: Survey and field study using semi-structured interviews of a purposive sample of code set practitioners. Open coding and thematic analysis on interview transcripts, interview notes, and answers to open-ended survey questions. Results: Thirty-six respondents completed the survey, of whom 15 participated in follow-up interviews. We found great variability in the methods, degree of formality, tools, expertise, and data used in code set construction and validation. We found universal agreement that crafting high-quality code sets is difficult, but very different ideas about how this can be achieved and validated. A primary divide exists between those who rely on empirical techniques using patient-level data and those who only rely on expertise and semantic data. We formulated a method- and process-based model able to account for observed variability in formality, thoroughness, resources, and techniques. Conclusion: Our model provides a structure for organizing a set of recommendations to facilitate reuse based on metadata capture during the code set development process. It classifies validation methods by the data they depend on -- semantic, empirical, and derived -- as they are applied over a sequence of phases: (1) code collection; (2) code evaluation; (3) code set evaluation; (4) code set acceptance; and, optionally, (5) reporting of methods used and validation results. This schematization of real-world practices informs our analysis of and response to persistent challenges in code set development. Potential re-users of existing code sets can find little evidence to support trust in their quality and fitness for use, particularly when reusing a code set in a new study or database context. Rather than allowing code set sharing and reuse to remain separate activities, occurring before and after the main action of code set development, sharing and reuse must permeate every step of the process in order to produce reliable evidence of quality and fitness for use.","output":"Practices, norms, and aspirations regarding the construction, validation, and reuse of code sets in the analysis of real-world data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to determine the effect of managerial initiatives on the adoption of traceability systems on food cold chain performance during the Covid-19 pandemic.

In order to effectively prepare a localized plan for infectious disease management, it is important to find the relationship between COVID-19 infection rate and other key variables. This study aims to understand the spatial relationships between COVID-19 infection rate and key variables of air pollution, geo-meteorological, and social parameters in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The relationship was analyzed using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) by means of COVID-19 infection rate as a dependent variable and 17 independent variables. This study revealed that air pollution parameters like PM(2.5) (p < 0.02), AOT (p < 0.01), CO (p < 0.05), water vapor (p < 0.01), and O(3) (p < 0.01) were highly correlated with COVID-19 infection rate while geo-meteorological parameters like DEM (p < 0.01), wind pressure (p < 0.01), LST (p < 0.04), rainfall (p < 0.01), and wind speed (p < 0.03) were also similarly associated. Social parameters like population density (p < 0.01), brickfield density (p < 0.02), and poverty level (p < 0.01) showed high coefficients as the key independent variables to COVID-19 infection rate. Significant robust relationships between these factors were found in the middle and southern parts of the city where the reported COVID-19 infection case was also higher. Relevant agencies can utilize these findings to formulate new and smart strategies for reducing infectious diseases like COVID-19 in Dhaka and in similar urban cities around the world.

Taken together, this requires learning to be virtual. Second is how the shift to virtual or hybrid working structures impacts the inherently social nature of learning at work and particularly of informal learning.

CMD prevalence was 40% in the whole area and 80% in Prachinburi, 43% in Sakaeo, 37% in Burium, 25% in Surin, and 19% in Sisaket provinces. Disease incidence of CMD was highest 43.08% in Sakaeo, followed by 26.78% in Prachinburi, 7% in Burium, 2.58% in Surin, and 1.25% in Sisaket provinces. Disease severity of CMD symptoms was mild chlorosis to moderate mosaic (2-3). The greatest disease severity was recorded in Prachinburi and Sakaeo provinces. Asymptomatic plants were identified in Surin (12%), Prachinburi (5%), Sakaeo (0.2%), and Buriram (0.1%) by PCR analysis. Cassava cultivars CMR-89 and Huai Bong 80 were susceptible to CMD. In 95% of cases, the infection was transmitted by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci), which were abundant in Sakaeo, Buriram, and Prachinburi but were sparse in Surin; their densities were highest in May and June 2019.

We obtained local evidence for two pneumonia and two SRD and matched those with the FDA records. We assessed how SRD patterns were reported among nonvascular death's dataset. Results The FDA PLATO records indicate that clopidogrel caused numerically less ( n = 8) primary pneumonia deaths than ticagrelor ( n = 10) but over three times more SRD ( n = 23/7). Among matched verifiable outcomes, both pneumonia deaths were correct, but two clopidogrel SRD were incorrect.

In this way, we have been studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and working conditions, emotional status and other health-related aspects, as well as those concerning contagion risk perception and its outcomes or citizens compliance with pandemic control measures. In detail, two questions detect the impact of the pandemic on emotional status: intrusive thinking' as dimension of psychological stress associated to experiencing COVID-19 emergency, and degree of concern' about the current situation as a dimension of anxiety. Even if the two items are not precise tools to assess mental health symptoms, they are in the condition to give hints for an estimation of the pandemic impact on the psychological well-being in the general population. Preliminary findings, from the analysis of 5,000 interviews, show quite direct experience of COVID (bereavements in family or COVID-positive friends), worsened economic resources among the working-age individuals, and social isolation in the elderly, as the main determinants of intrusive thinking.

Our study sought to assess the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on hospitalizations for alcohol-related hepatitis at a community hospital system. We hypothesized an increase in cases of alcohol-related hepatitis requiring inpatient management, mirroring the strain on economic and societal norms imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. APPROACH/RESULTS: We performed a retrospective chart review to study the incidence of alcohol-related hepatitis in patients presenting to 3 community hospitals in Fresno, California, before and during the COVID-19. Data including patient demographics, markers of disease severity, and clinical course were extracted from electronic medical records for 329 patients included in the study. There was a 51% increase in the overall incidence of alcohol-related hepatitis requiring hospitalization between 2019 and 2020 (P=0.003) and 69% increase (P<0.001) after implementation of the stay-at-home orders. In addition, 94% (P=0.028) increase in rehospitalizations was noted in 2020 (P=0.028), a 100% increase in patients under the age of 40 (P=0.0028), as well as a trend towards a 125% increase (P=0.06) of female patients admitted with this diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed drastic increases in severe alcohol-related hepatitis requiring inpatient management, specifically in patients under the age of 40 and in women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with severe alcohol-related hepatitis, these findings have far-reaching and lasting implications for our already strained health care system extending beyond the COVID-19 pandemic timeframe.

Shortness of breath is a feeling associated with impaired respiratory function. As difficulty breathing, I can not breathe. It occurs in 64 % in Covid 19 patients. Objective: Our goal is to evaluate dyspnoea using Borg scale that assesses the functional state of respiratory function. MaterialCmethods: We assessed (92) Covid 19 patients with a categorical ten-point rating, a corresponding verbal description (Table 1). Patients were aged between 44C78 years old. Fifty of them (50) were obese, body weight >greater than 90 kg with comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes mellitus). The assessment was performed by a specialist anaesthesiologist (pain clinic) on the Borg scale. Results: (12) Covid 19 patients with moderate dyspnoea.

Three adjuvant technologies have been tested using intranasal and spray delivery methods to poultry. Those technologies are water in oil in water emulsion, nanoparticles and polymer adjuvants. Intranasal delivery of polymer and nanoparticles adjuvanted live vaccines improved significantly the antibody titer and protection to challenge observed compared to a commercial non-adjuvanted reference. Moreover, spray delivery of the polymer adjuvanted vaccine showed a significantly higher protection compared to the non-adjuvanted reference.

Our aim was to characterize imaging, lab, and clinical correlates of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leukoencephalopathy, which may provide insight into the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-seven consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who had brain MR imaging following intensive care unit admission were included. Seven (7/27, 26%) developed an unusual pattern of \\"leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity\\" on diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The remaining patients did not exhibit this pattern. Clinical and laboratory indices, as well as neuroimaging findings, were compared between groups. RESULTS The reduced-diffusivity group had a significantly higher body mass index (36 versus 28 kg/m2, P < .01). Patients with reduced diffusivity trended toward more frequent acute renal failure (7/7, 100% versus 9/20, 45%; P = .06) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate values (49 versus 85 mL/min; P = .06) at the time of MRI. Patients with reduced diffusivity also showed lesser mean values of the lowest hemoglobin levels (8.1 versus 10.2 g/dL, P < .05) and higher serum sodium levels (147 versus 139 mmol/L, P = .04) within 24 hours before MR imaging. The reduced-diffusivity group showed a striking and highly reproducible distribution of confluent, predominantly symmetric, supratentorial, and middle cerebellar peduncular white matter lesions (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight notable correlations between severe COVID-19 leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity and obesity, acute renal failure, mild hypernatremia, anemia, and an unusual brain MR imaging white matter lesion distribution pattern. Together, these observations may shed light on possible SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with leukoencephalopathy, including borderzone ischemic changes, electrolyte transport disturbances, and silent hypoxia in the setting of the known cytokine storm syndrome that accompanies severe COVID-19.","output":"Clinical, Imaging, and Lab Correlates of Severe COVID-19 Leukoencephalopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emodin is a cell arrest and apoptosis-inducing compound that is widely distributed in different plants (rhubarb, aloe), lichens and terrestrial fungi, and also isolated from marine-derived fungi and marine sponge-associated fungi.

Studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in humans after the first identified case in the area were included. Studies that only reported serological responses among patients with COVID-19, those using known infection status samples, or any animal experiments were all excluded. All data used for analysis were extracted from included papers. Study quality was assessed using a standardised scale. We estimated age-specific, sex-specific, and race-specific seroprevalence by WHO regions and subpopulations with different levels of exposures, and the ratio of serology-identified infections to virologically confirmed cases. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020198253. FINDINGS: 16 506 studies were identified in the initial search, 2523 were assessed for eligibility after removal of duplicates and inappropriate titles and abstracts, and 404 serological studies (representing tests in 5 168 360 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis. In the 82 studies of higher quality, close contacts (180%, 95% CI 157-203) and high-risk health-care workers (171%, 99-244) had higher seroprevalence than did low-risk health-care workers (42%, 15-69) and the general population (80%, 68-92). The heterogeneity between included studies was high, with an overall I2 of 999% (p<00001). Seroprevalence varied greatly across WHO regions, with the lowest seroprevalence of general populations in the Western Pacific region (17%, 95% CI 00-50). The pooled infection-to-case ratio was similar between the region of the Americas (69, 95% CI 27-173) and the European region (84, 65-107), but higher in India (565, 285-1120), the only country in the South-East Asia region with data.

Obesity, an independent risk factor for both CVD and T2D, further worsens the problem, with over 42% of adults and 18.5% of youth in the U.S. categorized as such.

Recently, we discovered a class of cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine (penta-Arg) motif that traffics readily to the cytosol and nucleus of mammalian cells with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs containing a penta-Arg motif are released efficiently from endosomes, while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using an RNA interference screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein-sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. CPMPs localize within the lumen of Rab7+ and Lamp1+ endosomes and their transport requires HOPS activity. Overall, our results identify Lamp1+ late endosomes and lysosomes as portals for passing proteins into the cytosol and suggest that this environment is prerequisite for endosomal escape.","output":"HOPS-dependent endosomal fusion required for efficient cytosolic delivery of therapeutic peptides and small proteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late 2019, communities have been required to rapidly adopt community mitigation strategies rarely used before, or only in limited settings.

In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors. METHODS: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. FINDINGS: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would 'somewhat' affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 849% had performed &#8805;1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 934% performed &#8805;1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government/authorities (aOR: 6.0, 95% CI 2.6-110), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 40, 95% CI: 18-87), higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 5.0, 95% CI: 15-9.3), higher trust in government (aOR: 6.0, 95% CI: 2.6-11.0) and higher level of concern if self-isolated (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.0).

Molecular stratification, in conjunction with the traditional TNM staging, is a promising way to predict patient outcomes. We investigated the interconnectivity between tumor stage and tumor biology reflected by the Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMSs) in CRC, and explored the possible value of these insights in patients with stage II colon cancer. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using clinical records and gene expression profiling in a meta-cohort of 1040 CRC patients. The interconnectivity of tumor biology and disease stage was assessed by investigating the association between CMSs and TNM classification. In order to validate the clinical applicability of our findings we employed a meta-cohort of 197 stage II colon cancers. RESULTS: CMS4 was significantly more prevalent in advanced stages of disease (stage I 9.8% versus stage IV 38.5%, p < 0.001). The observed differential gene expression between cancer stages is at least partly explained by the biological differences as reflected by CMS subtypes. Gene signatures for stage III-IV and CMS4 were highly correlated (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). CMS4 cancers showed an increased progression rate to more advanced stages (CMS4 compared to CMS2: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46).

However, the other factors those enhance the use of Anakinra in the situation of viremia also could be sorted as no response to full dose antivirals, antiviral side effects or no success to antiviral treatment.

In South Korea, however, there has been no official statistic related to it. In this study, we extract the time series of influenza incidence from National Health Insurance Service claims database, which consists of all medical and prescription drug-claim records for all South Korean population. The extracted time series contains the number of new patients by region (250 city-county-districts) and age-group (0C4, 5C19, 20C64, 65+) within a week. The number of cases of influenza (2009C2017) is 12,282,356. For computing an onset of influenza outbreak by region and age-group, we propose a novel method for early outbreak detection, in which the onset of outbreak is detected as a sudden change in the time derivative of incidence. The advantage of it over the cumulative sum and the exponentially weighted moving average control charts, which have been widely used for the early outbreak detection of infectious diseases, is that information on the previous non-epidemic periods are not necessary. Then, we show that the metro area and 5C19 age-group are earlier than the rural area and other age-groups for the start of the influenza outbreak. Also, the metro area and 5C19 age-group peak earlier than the rural area and other age-groups. These results would be helpful to design a surveillance system for timely early warning of an influenza outbreak in South Korea.","output":"Early detection of influenza outbreak using time derivative of incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If the covid-19 virus is transmitted largely by superspreaders, it might not go pandemic, reports Debora MacKenzie","output":"Is it super-spreading?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In summer 2020, we invited the 6761 undergraduate students who took a Spring 2020 math course at the University of Arizona to participate in a survey, with 13% responding.

The trauma and burnout associated with moral injury has profound implications for the mental health of HPs. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential factors associated with moral injury for HPs who were involved in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, prior to the availability of vaccines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this qualitative study, HPs were actively recruited to participate in a survey via snowball sampling via email and social media in 2 phases of 5 weeks each: April 24 to May 30, 2020 (phase 1), and October 24 to November 30, 2020 (phase 2). Overall, 1831 respondents answered demographic questions and assessments for moral injury, intrinsic religiosity, and burnout. Of those, 1344 responded to the open-ended questions. Responses to open-ended questions were coded iteratively and thematically analyzed within the framework of moral injury. EXPOSURES: Working in a patient care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic prior to the availability of vaccines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Inductive thematic analysis of open-response survey answers identified dominant emotions and common stressors associated with moral injury. RESULTS: There were 335 individuals (109 [32.6%] aged 35-44 years; 288 [86.0%] women; 294 [87.8%] White) in phase 1 and 1009 individuals (384 [38.1%] aged 35-44 years; 913 [90.5%] women; 945 [93.7%] White) in phase 2. In phase 1, the respondents were predominantly nurses (100 [29.9%]), physicians (78 [23.3%]), advanced practice practitioners (APPs) (70 [20.9%]), and chaplains (55 [16.4%]). In phase 2, the respondents were predominantly nurses (589 [58.4%]), physicians (114 [11.3%]), and APPs (104 [10.3%]). HPs faced numerous stressors, such as fear of contagion, stigmatization, short-staffing, and inadequate personal protective equipment. The emotions experienced were (1) fear in phase 1, then fatigue in phase 2; (2) isolation and alienation; and (3) betrayal. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that HPs experienced moral injury during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moral injury was not only experienced after a single moral dilemma but also from working in morally injurious environments. These experiences can serve as potential starting points for organizations to engender and enhance organizational and individual recovery, team building, and trust. System-level solutions that address shortages in staffing and personal protective equipment are needed to promote HP well-being.","output":"Morally Injurious Experiences and Emotions of Health Care Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic Before Vaccine Availability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Serologic assay performance studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-a??2) in pediatric populations are lacking, and few seroprevalence studies have routinely incorporated orthogonal testing to improve accuracy.

Impairment in patient screening and risk management plays a fundamental role on how governments and authorities are directing resources, planning reopening, as well as sanitary countermeasures, especially in regions where poverty is a major component in the equation. An efficient diagnostic method must be highly accurate, while having a cost-effective profile. We combined a machine learning-based algorithm with mass spectrometry to create an expeditious platform that discriminate COVID-19 in plasma samples within minutes, while also providing tools for risk assessment, to assist healthcare professionals in patient management and decision-making. A cross-sectional study enrolled 815 patients (442 COVID-19, 350 controls and 23 COVID-19 suspicious) from three Brazilian epicenters from April to July 2020. We were able to elect and identify 19 molecules related to the diseases pathophysiology and several discriminating features to patients health-related outcomes. The method applied for COVID-19 diagnosis showed specificity >96% and sensitivity >83%, and specificity >80% and sensitivity >85% during risk assessment, both from blinded data. Our method introduced a new approach for COVID-19 screening, providing the indirect detection of infection through metabolites and contextualizing the findings with the diseases pathophysiology.

We aimed to assess the number, characteristics and in-hospital course of patients admitted for acute cardiovascular diseases during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS We enrolled all consecutive patients admitted urgently for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure or arrhythmias from 1 March to 31 May 2020 (outbreak period) and 2019 (control period). We evaluated the time from symptoms onset to presentation, clinical conditions at admission, length of hospitalization, in-hospital medical procedures and outcome. The combined primary end point included in-hospital death for cardiovascular causes, urgent heart transplant or discharge with a ventricular assist device. RESULTS A similar number of admissions were observed in 2020 (N = 210) compared with 2019 (N = 207). Baseline characteristics of patients were also similar. In 2020, a significantly higher number of patients presented more than 6 h after symptoms onset (57 versus 38%, P < 0.001) and with signs of heart failure (33 versus 20%, P = 0.018), required urgent surgery (13 versus 5%, P = 0.004) and ventilatory support (26 versus 13%, P < 0.001). Hospitalization duration was longer in 2020 (median 10 versus 8 days, P = 0.03). The primary end point was met by 19 (9.0%) patients in 2020 versus 10 (4.8%) in 2019 (P = 0.09). CONCLUSION Despite the similar number and types of unplanned admissions for acute cardiac conditions during the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak compared with the same period in 2019, we observed a higher number of patients presenting late after symptoms onset as well as longer and more complicated clinical courses.","output":"Characteristics and hospital course of patients admitted for acute cardiovascular diseases during the coronavirus disease-19 outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To gather data on the most common chief complaints, diagnoses, in-office procedures, and surgeries that presented to the Kresge Eye Institute's Emergency Clinic in Detroit, Michigan during the COVID-19 state lockdown period to provide data for staff and resource allocation in future waves.

Beak trimming is a common practice to control these problems, but in Finland beak trimming is prohibited. Finnish egg producers have decades-long experience of egg production with intact-beaked hens. This experience, and their management of pecking-related problems, could benefit producers in other countries. The online questionnaire aimed to gather information about Finnish farmers attitudes towards beak trimming, their estimation of the seriousness of pecking problems in their laying hen flocks, common risk factors and the best practices to prevent attendant problems. The questionnaire received 35 responses. Finnish egg producers appeared strongly to support a policy of not trimming beaks. Motivation against beak trimming was explained by considering it to be unnecessary and unethical. Most respondents did not regard pecking-related problems as being very severe in their flocks. Lighting, feeding and flock management problems represented the most important risk factors regarding pecking problems. Generally, the same topics were highlighted as being the most important intervention measures for managing an on-going pecking problem. The study indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy as a component of sustainable egg production. ABSTRACT: Pecking-related problems are common in intensive egg production, compromising hen welfare, causing farmers economic losses and negatively affecting sustainability. These problems are often controlled by beak trimming, which in Finland is prohibited. An online questionnaire aimed to collect information from farmers about pecking-related problems in Finnish laying hen flocks, important risk factors and the best experiences to prevent the problems. Additionally, the farmers attitudes towards beak trimming were examined. We received 35 responses, which represents about 13% of all Finnish laying hen farms with 300 laying hens. The majority of respondents stated that a maximum of 5C7% incidence of feather pecking or 1C2% incidence of cannibalism would be tolerable. The majority of respondents (74%) expressed that they would definitely not use beak-trimmed hens. Only two respondents indicated that they would probably use beak-trimmed hens were the practice permitted. Among risk factors, light intensity earned the highest mean (6.3), on a scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important). Other important problems included those that occurred during rearing, feeding, flock management and problems with drinking water equipment (mean 5.9, each). The most important intervention measures included optimal lighting and feeding, flock management, and removing the pecker and victim. Concluding, Finnish farmers had strong negative attitudes towards beak trimming. The study underlines the importance of flock management, especially lighting and feeding, in preventing pecking problems and indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy into sustainable egg production.","output":"Feather Pecking and Cannibalism in Non-Beak-Trimmed Laying Hen FlocksFarmers Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Oxymetazoline HCl 0.05%, 1:100,000 lidocaine with epinephrine (lido+epi), and 1:1000 epinephrine are all colorless solutions employed in sinus surgery. Because lido+epi is injected whereas others are not, care must be taken to label all solutions to avoid inadvertent injection of oxymetazoline or concentrated epinephrine because of life-threatening complications. Dyes have been used to color solutions for visual identification, but efficacy and cost have never been compared. We sought to determine the effectiveness of surgical marking pen (gentian violet) and fluorescein strips as coloring agents in mediums commonly used in sinus surgery. METHODS In this specialty techniques study, 4 liquid mediums (normal saline [NS], 0.05% oxymetazoline, 1:1,000 epinephrine, and lido+epi) and 2 coloring agents (fluorescein strip and surgical marking pen) were combined separately. Photos and absorbance of each solution were obtained at 15-minute intervals over 2 hours using a spectrophotometer. RESULTS Peak absorbance remained stable for all solutions with fluorescein. Absorbance also remained constant for NS (0.37 absorbance units [AU]  0.37 AU) and oxymetazoline (2.8 AU  2.8 AU) mixed with marking pen. Absorbance decreased over 2 hours when marking pen was mixed with 1:1000 epinephrine (0.82 AU  0.32 AU) and lido+epi (1.19 AU  0.33 AU). Furthermore, the majority of color visibility and absorbance decreased in the first 15 minutes for concentrated epinephrine (0.82  0.33) and lido+epi (1.19  0.51). Cost of fluorescein strips ($0.14 to $0.20/strip) was less than marking pens ($13 to 46/pen). CONCLUSION Compared to marking pen dye, solutions dyed with fluorescein retained their color and did not decay over time. We recommend fluorescein strips to label colorless materials in the operating room because of their lack of color decay and cost advantages.","output":"Staining intraoperative topical solutions with fluorescein: enhancing the safety of sinus surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we analyse the impact of the COVID-19 measures on teaching the conceptual drawing course at the Architecture and Urbanism Faculty of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (FAU/UFRJ).

Our objective is to develop and validate quantitative survey instruments to measure womens empowerment in relation to sanitation in urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are developing the Agency, Resources and Institutional Structures for Sanitation-related Empowerment scales through a process that involves three phases: item development; scale development and initial validation and scale evaluation and further validation. The first phase includes domain specification, item generation, face validity and content validity assessment and item refinement. The second phase involves a second round of face validity and content validity assessment, followed by survey implementation in two cities (Tiruchirappalli, India and Kampala, Uganda) and data analysis involving factor analysis and item response theory approaches as well as reliability and validity testing. The third phase involves a final round of face validity and content validity assessment, followed by survey implementation in three additional cities (Narsapur and Warangal, India and Lusaka, Zambia) and statistical analysis using similar approaches as in phase 2 for further validation.

The resultant disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic, leading to severe health and economic burdens. Although the recently announced vaccines against COVID-19 has rekindled hope, there is still a major challenge to urgently meet the global need for rapid treatment of the pandemic. Given the urgency of the CoV outbreak, we propose a strategy to screen potential broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Since the essential functional domains of CoV are extensively homologous, the availability of two types of mild CoV, HCoV-OC43 and MHV, should provide a valuable tool for the rapid identification of promising drugs against CoV without the drawbacks of level three biological confinements. The luciferase reporter gene is introduced into HCoV-OC43 and MHV to indicate viral activity, and hence the antiviral efficiency of screened drugs can be quantified by luciferase activity. Compounds with antiviral activity against both HCoV-OC43 and MHV are further evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 after structural optimizations. This system allows large-scale compounds to be screened to search for broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, providing potential alternatives for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 or other CoV.","output":"A high-throughput drug screening strategy against coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isatis indigotica has a long history in treating virus infection and related symptoms in China.

In this study, this model was employed to investigate the effect and mechanism of indirubin, a natural bisindole alkaloid from Isatis indigotica, on influenza A virus susceptibility. In the in vitro study, the stress hormone corticosterone was used to simulate restraint stress. Our results demonstrated that indirubin decreased the susceptibility to influenza virus with lowered mortality and alleviated lung damage in restraint-stressed mice model. Moreover, indirubin promoted the expression of interferon- and interferon inducible transmembrane 3. In addition, indirubin maintained the morphology and function of mitochondria following influenza A virus infection.

However, it remains unclear whether the large-scale vaccination can succeed in containing the COVID-19 pandemic and how soon. We develop an epidemiological model named SUVQC (Suceptible-Unquarantined-Vaccined-Quarantined-Confirmed) to quantitatively analyze and predict the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 under vaccination. Methods: In addition to the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), our model explicitly parameterizes key factors related to vaccination, including the duration of immunity, vaccine efficacy, and daily vaccination rate etc. The model is applied to the daily released numbers of confirmed cases of Israel and United States of America to explore and predict the trend under vaccination based on their current epidemic status and intervention measures. We further provide a formula for designing a practical vaccination strategy, which simultaneously considers the effects of the basic reproductive number of COVID-19, intensity of NPIs, duration of immunological memory after vaccination, vaccine efficacy and daily vaccination rate. Findings: For Israel, of which 53.83% of the population was fully vaccinated, under the current intensity of NPIs and vaccination scheme, the pandemic is predicted to end between May 14, 2021 to May 16, 2021 depending on an immunity duration between 180 days and 365 days;Assuming no NPIs after March 24, 2021, the pandemic will ends later, between July 4, 2021 to August 26, 2021. For USA, if we assume the current vaccination rate (0.268% per day) and intensity of NPIs, the pandemic will end between February 3, 2022 and August 17, 2029 depending on an immunity duration between 180 days and 365 days. However, assuming an immunity duration of 180 days and with no NPIs, the pandemic will not end, and instead reach an equilibrium state with a proportion of the population remaining actively infected. Interpretation: Overall the daily vaccination rate should be chosen according to the vaccine efficacy and the immunity duration to achieve herd immunity. In some situations, vaccination alone cannot stop the pandemic, and NPIs are necessary both to supplement vaccination and accelerate the end of the pandemic. Considering that vaccine efficacy and duration of immunity may be reduced for new mutant strains, it is necessary to remain cautiously optimistic about the prospect of the pandemic under vaccination.

Bacterial infections were defined using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes and associated present on admission coding. Coinfections were defined by bacterial infection present on admission, while secondary infections were defined by bacterial infection that developed after admission. Coinfection and secondary infection were not mutually exclusive. A total of 18.5% of 64,961 COVID-19 patients (n = 12,040) presented with bacterial infection at admission, 3.8% (n = 2,506) developed secondary infection after admission, and 0.9% (n = 574) had both; 76.3% (n = 49,551) received an antibiotic while hospitalized, including 71% of patients who had no diagnosis of bacterial infection.

Speaking generates particles and drops across the size spectrum. Small particles are removed from indoor air at room scale by ventilation, filtration, and deposition; large particles mainly deposit onto indoor surfaces. Proximate exposure enhancements are associated with large particles with contributions from ballistic drops. Masking and social distancing are effective in mitigating transmission from proximate exposures. At room scale, masking, ventilation, and filtration can contribute to limit exposures. Important information gaps prevent a quantitative reconciliation of the high overall global spread of COVID-19 with known transmission pathways. Available information supports several findings with moderate-to-high confidence: transmission occurs predominantly indoors; inhalation of airborne particles (up to 50 m in diameter) contributes substantially to viral spread; transmission occurs in near proximity and at room scale; speaking is a major source of airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus; and emissions can occur without strong illness symptoms.","output":"Indoor aerosol science aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health messaging, including guidance regarding protective health behavior (e.g., use of non-medical masks), changed over time.

Though, such features of social media platforms also present it a root cause of fake news distribution, causing adverse consequences on both people and culture. Hence, detecting fake news has become a significant research interest for bringing feasible real time solutions to the problem. Most current techniques of fake news disclosure are supervised, that need large cost in terms of time and effort to make a certainly interpreted dataset. The proposed framework concentrates on the text-based detection of fake news items while considering that only limited number of labels are available.

We come up with a semi-supervised fake news detection technique based on GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks). The recommended architecture comprises of three basic components: collecting word embeddings from the news articles in datasets utilising GloVe, building similarity graph using Word Movers Distance (WMD) and finally applying Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for binary classification of news articles in semi-supervised paradigm.

Methods: Health care, economy, epidemiological data are collected from various sources including the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) or other government sources. Results: The KCDC jointly with medical professionals developed a series of innovations such as 1) Full contact tracing and rapid testing with a 12 hours turnaround and 10 minutes movement tracking systems, 2) transparent disclosure of all contract tracing data to the public through a central database, 3) Drive-Through and Walk-Through testing methods, and 4) a 4 tier patient severity index and community treatment isolation centers. Korea moved from the 4th in the world for total confirmed cases in March down to 76th in August. Conclusions: Expedited enforcement of amended legislation acts to protect the healthcare workforce resulted in only 10 healthcare professionals contracting the virus while caring for Covid-19 patients. This has resulted in minimal human capital loss and the government was able to re-direct existing medical workforce to areas in need. The quarantine strategies implemented resulted in little need to lock down the whole economy but also limited the cost spent to gain a year of life to 193,848 Won (US$163).","output":"Policies and innovations to battle Covid-19 - A Case study of South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Poult Enteritis and Mortality Syndrome (PEMS) is a condition of yet undefined etiology. Affected flocks may exhibit 100% morbidity with mortality up to 50% or more between 2 to 4 wk of age. The current study reports the immune status of poults experimentally infected with PEMS agent(s) in various trials. When compared with the unchallenged controls, PEMS-infected poults had significant atrophy of the bursa (up to 2-fold), thymus (up to 11-fold), and spleen (up to 2-fold) (P < or = 0.05). When challenged with SRBC, PEMS-infected poults had 1 to 2 log2 lower anti-SRBC antibody titers than the controls (P < or = 0.05). Responsiveness to a mitogenic lectin, phytohemagglutinin-P, was reduced significantly in PEMS poults (P < or = 0.05). These data show that the immune system of the poults is compromised significantly during PEMS infection in terms of lymphoid organ integrity and humoral and cell-mediated immunity. These findings imply, therefore, that immune dysfunction may contribute to the mortality observed during PEMS outbreaks.","output":"Immune system dysfunction during exposure to poult enteritis and mortality syndrome agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guava fruit has a short postharvest shelf life at room temperature. Melatonin is widely used for preservation of various postharvest fruit and vegetables. In this study, an optimal melatonin treatment (600 molL-1, 2 h) was identified, which effectively delayed fruit softening and reduced the incidence of anthracnose on guava fruit. Melatonin effectively enhanced the antioxidant capacity and reduced the oxidative damage to the fruit by reducing the contents of superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde; improving the overall antioxidant capacity and enhancing the enzymatic antioxidants and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Melatonin significantly enhanced the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase. The contents of total flavonoids and ascorbic acid were maintained by melatonin. This treatment also enhanced the defense-related enzymatic activities of chitinase and phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes, including phenylalanine ammonia lyase and 4-coumaric acid-CoA-ligase. The activities of lipase, lipoxygenase and phospholipase D related to lipid metabolism were repressed by melatonin. These results showed that exogenous melatonin can maintain the quality of guava fruit and enhance its resistance to disease by improving the antioxidant and defense systems of the fruit.","output":"Melatonin Treatment Improves Postharvest Preservation and Resistance of Guava Fruit (Psidium guajava L.)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Volunteers are common within palliative care services, and provide support that enhances care quality. The support they provided, and any role changes, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are unknown. The aim of this study is to understand volunteer deployment and activities within palliative care services, and to identify what may affect any changes in volunteer service provision, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Multi-national online survey disseminated via key stakeholders to specialist palliative care services, completed by lead clinicians. Data collected on volunteer roles, deployment, and changes in volunteer engagement. Analysis included descriptive statistics, a multivariable logistic regression, and analysis of free-text comments using a content analysis approach. RESULTS: 458 respondents: 277 UK, 85 rest of Europe, and 95 rest of the world. 68.5% indicated volunteer use pre-COVID-19 across a number of roles (from 458): direct patient facing support (58.7%), indirect support (52.0%), back office (48.5%) and fundraising (45.6%). 11% had volunteers with COVID-19. Of those responding to a question on change in volunteer deployment (328 of 458) most (256/328, 78%) indicated less or much less use of volunteers. Less use of volunteers was associated with being an in-patient hospice, (odds ratio [OR]=0.15, 95% CI=0.07-0.3, P<.001). This reduction in volunteers was felt to protect potentially vulnerable volunteers, with policy changes preventing volunteer support. However, adapting was also seen where new roles were created, or existing roles pivoted to provide virtual support. CONCLUSION: Volunteers were mostly prevented from supporting many forms of palliative care which may have quality and safety implications given their previously central roles. Volunteer re-deployment plans are needed that take a more considered approach, using volunteers more flexibly to enhance care while ensuring safe working practices. Consideration needs to be given to widening the volunteer base away from those who may be considered to be most vulnerable to COVID-19.","output":"Prohibit, Protect, or Adapt?

Machine learningCbased automated gene data classification is an essential aspect for diagnosis of gene related any malfunctions and diseases. As the size of the data is very large, it is essential to design a suitable classifier that can process huge amount of data. Deep learning is one of the advanced machine learning techniques to mitigate these types of problems. Due the presence of more number of hidden layers, it can easily handle the big amount of data. We have presented a method of classification to understand the convergence of training deep neural network (DNN). The assumptions are taken as the inputs do not degenerate and the network is over-parameterized. Also the number of hidden neurons is sufficiently large. Authors in this piece of work have used DNN for classifying the gene expressions data. The dataset used in the work contains the bone marrow expressions of 72 leukemia patients. A five-layer DNN classifier is designed for classifying acute lymphocyte (ALL) and acute myelocytic (AML) samples. The network is trained with 80% data and rest 20% data is considered for validation purpose. Proposed DNN classifier is providing a satisfactory result as compared to other classifiers. Two types of leukemia are classified with 98.2% accuracy, 96.59% sensitivity, and 97.9% specificity.

We reviewed the changes in our management protocol for these lesions as our disease understanding and preparedness evolved. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective observational study including patients with sellar-suprasellar and clival lesions presenting to us between March and October 2020. Management protocols were divided into three phases based on the prevalence of the disease and the number of mandatory preoperative COVID-19 tests being conducted. The surgical approach used was analyzed in relation to the preferred approach during pre-COVID times, and surgical outcomes and complications were noted. RESULTS A total of 31 cases were operated during this period. During Phase I (low prevalence; no preoperative COVID testing) endonasal surgeries were largely abandoned in favor of transcranial approaches. In Phase II (medium prevalence; one preoperative COVID test) we gradually resumed endonasal surgeries for 'emergent' and 'essential' cases, and subsequently in Phase III (high prevalence; two preoperative COVID tests), we had no hesitation in performing 'elective' endonasal surgeries with additional barriers for prevention of aerosol transmission. No patient developed COVID-19 infection postoperatively. Eight HCWs in our department acquired the disease during this period, none of whom were directly involved in the surgeries for the above cohort of patients. CONCLUSIONS With a strict preoperative COVID testing protocol, adherence to proper drilling techniques and using additional barriers to prevent droplet and aerosol spread, endonasal surgeries for sellar-suprasellar lesions are safe during this COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Adapting management strategies for sellar-suprasellar lesions during the COVID-19 pandemic: a pragmatic approach from the frontline."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sequence homology between neurotoxins and the site encompassing the furin cleavage site 680SPRRAR685 in the spike protein (S) of CoV2 suggested that this site could interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Molecular dynamics simulations confirm robust structural similarity between wild-type (WT) CoV2 and the binding motif of -conotoxin to 9 nAChR, which is known to modulate IL-1{beta} in immune cells. We show that the structural integrity of this binding motif is eliminated by Alpha P681H mutation, reemerged in Delta variant P681R, and disappeared again with Omicron N679H/P681H. Interactions between the toxin-mimic CoV2 motif and 9-nAChR are expected to trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines an effect that is mollified by Alpha and Omicron. Clinical features of this interaction site are relevant because, contrary to most regions in the S protein, the furin binding site does not appear to trigger an immune response prior to cleavage, indicating that the cholinergic pathway should be activated in the respiratory tract and nasal mucosa where 9-nAChR co-localizes with the virus. The correlation of changes on this motif by the different variants closely matches the reported cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children by the CDC, and predicts significant mitigation of MIS-C with the Omicron variant.

Materials and methods. The clinical case shows our own follow-up of COVID-19 clinical course in the patient with concomitant rheumatoid arthritis during combination treatment with the use of a recombinant humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab. Results. The patient with a severe COVID-19 course, whose examination and treatment results are given in the article, was comerbid for rheumatoid arthritis. The cytokine storm development at the hospital stage was confirmed by an increase in markers of systemic inflammation: C-reactive protein, D-dimer, fibrinogen, an almost 50-fold increase in serum interleukin-6 level, as well as absolute and relative lymphocytopenia. Despite the anti-inflammatory therapy administered with systemic corticosteroids, the patient's condition progressively worsened. After assessing the indications and contraindications, it was decided to use the interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab, followed by rapid clinical, laboratory and X-ray positive response to the treatment. The understanding of tocilizumab use in patients with COVID-19 at the current stage was formed based on the comparative analysis of our own clinical case data and the results of relevant clinical trials, world recommendations and guidelines. Conclusions. The use of recombinant humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab in the combination treatment of severe COVID-19 with concomitant rheumatoid arthritis is pathogenetically based and decreases the main clinical and laboratory signs of cytokine storm, respiratory failure, improves chest x-ray findings and reduces the length of hospital stay.

Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was then derived from OLI-images, where the total area covered with water, bare soil, scattered vegetation, dense grasses and shrubs, and dense forests were estimated. Across the study period, 2019 had the highest rainfall (195 mm) and temperature (21.7 C), while the lowest rainfall was recorded in 2018 (154 mm). The Northern Badia showed a consistently larger area of dense vegetation on average (407.4 km2) compared to the Eastern (149.3km2), and Middle (55.2 km2) Badia. The total area covered with scattered vegetation in 2020 was higher than in 2019 and 2018 across the years and studied area, except in Middle Badia. Vegetation cover classes were inconsistent for Middle Badia in March, scattered vegetation was higher in 2019 compared to 2020. However, the total area covered with vegetation in July was lower than in March across the years and studied area. The curfew allowed the regeneration of shrubs and grasses in the study area, which helped in restoring the rangeland vegetation. COVID-19 lockdown served as a conservation grazing technique and provided a real case of restoring the degraded rangeland cover through managed grazing.

The mounting evidence examining the prevalence of perinatal mental illness identifies specific vulnerabilities and risk factors among migrant women. We know that migrant women experience persistent and systematic barriers in accessing healthcare and that healthcare services do not always respond appropriately to migrant womens needs, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in supporting positive perinatal mental health among migrant women. The purpose of this participatory health research study was to explore perinatal mental healthcare for migrant women in Ireland, from the perspectives of a diverse range of stakeholders (healthcare service providers, community organisations/networks/associations and migrant women). A key focus of this study was to collaboratively explore solution-focused approaches to improving access to supports and healthcare services for migrant women experiencing perinatal mental illness. Following ethical approval, data were collected during three key convenings, utilising the design principles of world caf philosophies. Thematic analysis led to the generation of the following two themes: Building Capability and Capacity and Empowering Migrant Women. The main conclusions lie in the provision of whole-system approaches in collectively, collaboratively and proactively planning strategies that address the many factors that affect access to healthcare services for migrant women experiencing perinatal mental illness. Drawing on the collective perspectives of a wide range of stakeholders, our innovative solution focused on providing recommendations aimed at strengthening supports and healthcare services for migrant women.","output":"Fostering Collective Approaches in Supporting Perinatal Mental Healthcare Access for Migrant Women: A Participatory Health Research Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 poses a serious threat to global health. Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is the most frequent symptom in patients with COVID-19 besides fever and cough. There are limited studies addressing MSK symptoms in patients with COVID-19. This review aims to provide an overview of current studies related to MSK pain in patients with COVID-19, summarize the possible mechanisms of myalgia, and describe the current management options. In addition to acute respiratory manifestations, COVID-19 might also affect neurological systems which include skeletal manifestations and muscular injury. A possible mechanism of MSK pain and myalgia in COVID-19 may be related to the distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and the occurrence of cytokine storms. ACE-2 has been shown to be the receptor of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2). Moreover, studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines could cause myalgia by inducing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. In addition, it was also found that the plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, IL-6, TNF, and e lymphopenia were higher in patients with COVID-19. In general, the treatment of MSK pain in patients with COVID-19 falls into pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Various treatments of each have its own merits.

The exact incidence and risk factors are still unknown. Herein we review the incidence and outcomes of pneumothorax in over 3000 patients admitted to our institution for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of COVID-19 cases admitted to our hospital. Patients who were diagnosed with a spontaneous pneumothorax were identified to calculate the incidence of this event. Their clinical characteristics were thoroughly documented. Data regarding their clinical outcomes were gathered. Each case was presented as a brief synopsis. RESULTS: Three thousand three hundred sixty-eight patients were admitted to our institution between March 1st, 2020 and June 8th, 2020 for suspected COVID 19 pneumonia, 902 patients were nasopharyngeal swab positive. Six cases of COVID-19 patients who developed spontaneous pneumothorax were identified (0.66%). Their baseline imaging showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations, mostly in the posterior and peripheral lung regions. 4/6 cases were associated with mechanical ventilation. All patients required placement of a chest tube. In all cases, mortality (66.6%) was not directly related to the pneumothorax.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial, severely immunocompromised patients who were hospitalised with symptomatic COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 15 grams of COVIG or 15 grams of intravenous immunoglobulin without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IVIG, control). Patients included were solid organ transplant patients with three drugs from different immunosuppressive classes or patient with disease or treatment severely affecting B-cell function. Patients that required mechanical ventilation or high flow nasal oxygen were excluded. All investigators, research staff, and participants were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoint was occurrence of severe COVID-19 evaluated up until day 28 after treatment, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, readmission for COVID-19 after hospital discharge or lack of clinical improvement on day seven or later.

Nonetheless, despite the efforts to mend the theoretical foundations and to close the gap between academia and empirical practice, the absolute majority of IoT-driven digital business ecosystem literature follows the trend of conceptual randomness while expanding the volume of publications exponentially.

Currently, no studies have investigated the factors associated with social isolation and loneliness among community-dwelling older adults. Therefore, this study analyzed the association of social isolation and loneliness with socioeconomic, clinical, and health characteristics, and Covid-19-related variables, among community-dwelling older adults during the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted via a telephone survey of community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years in Macapa, Amapa, Brazil. A structured form was used to collect data. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed using Pearson's correlation test and a linear regression model. RESULTS: Participants comprised 86 community-dwelling older adults with a mean age of 71.78+6.98 years. Among them, 9.3% were diagnosed with Covid-19, of whom 3.5% were hospitalized. Most participants reported no difficulty obtaining food, medicines, or attending routine medical appointments during the pandemic. Furthermore, 23.3% (n=20) were socially isolated, and 20.9% (n=18) reported feelings of loneliness. The mean values for fear, anxiety, and obsession were 19.017.25, 1.011.90, and 2.843.28, respectively. A moderate positive correlation was identified between loneliness and the number of diseases, and a weak positive correlation between loneliness and the number of medications and depressive symptoms and risk for sarcopenia. The linear regression model indicated that higher loneliness scores were associated with a greater number of diseases (=0.288; p=0.007).

Balloon aortic valvuloplasty can be used successfully as a bridge to definitive treatment or as palliative therapy in patients who are not candidates for either procedure. In this paper, we discuss and justify the current indications and contraindications for balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Additionally, the step-by-step procedure technique and most frequent complications are described. Moreover, we present the safety and feasibility of balloon aortic valvuloplasty in 33 consecutive patients on a waiting list for transcatheter aortic valve replacement at 3 expert Italian centers during the first and second waves of COVID-19, when clinical priorities focused on hospitalized patients with pneumonia. The procedural success in this cohort of patients was achieved in 31 patients (94%). Out of the 33 patients enrolled, 15 underwent TAVR within 5  2 months from the valvuloplasty, and at 6-month follow-up a total of 2 patients died for end-stage heart failure.","output":"Balloon aortic valvuloplasty review: the revenge during COVID-19 outbreak?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current debates about the roles of the public and private sectors in pharmaceutical innovation have a long history.

Thus, we used an existing network of primary care physicians and a practice of gastroenterology to investigate the pathway from screening to therapy. (2) Methods: HCV screening was prospectively included in a routine check-up of primary care physicians who cooperated regularly with a private gastroenterology practice. Anti-HCV-positive patients were referred for further specialized diagnostics and treatment if indicated. (3) Results: Seventeen primary care practices screened 1875 patients. Twelve individuals were anti-HCV-positive (0.6%), six of them reported previous antiviral HCV therapy, and one untreated patient was HCV-RNA-positive (0.05% of the population). None of the 12 anti-HCV-positive cases showed up at the private gastroenterology practice. Further clinical details of the pathway from screening to therapy could not be analyzed.

We report our experience of RT adapted schedules or strategy changes in older patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients aged 75 years were recruited during weekly chart rounds. All were potentially eligible for a specific intervention to reduce the frequency of patients visits to the hospital. The impact of deferring radiation and hypofractionation of RT schedules was assessed in terms of the number of courses initially planned and re-planned during the lockdown. RESULTS: Twenty patients were identified during the official lockdown in France (March 17 to May 11). Median age was 78y (75-95y). Most patients were male (n=12, 60%) being treated in the postoperative setting (n=17, 85%). RT was delayed in 11 cases (55%) with hormonal therapy prescribed in 10 cases (50%). Altered RT fractionation was proposed for five cases (25%) combinations of altered fractionation and deferral of radiation were applied in three cases (15%). The number of radiation courses initially planned and re-planned according to the pandemic context: 563 and 197 respectively (-62%; p<0.001). None presented recurrence when RT was initiated, and no patient developed symptomatic Covid-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the Covid-19 outbreak, individual risk-based radiation therapy seems to be safe. Systematic screening of patients for Covid-19 before starting radiotherapy is mandatory. In our department the oncogeriatrics expertise availability for daily practice was of great use during the pandemic.

Measuring antibody that predicts neutralising activity and the vaccine response is an absolute requirement for laboratory-based confirmatory and reference activity. The viral receptor binding domain (RBD) constitutes the prime target antigen for neutralising antibody. A double antigen binding assay (DABA), providing the most sensitive format has been exploited in a novel hybrid manner employing a solid-phase S1 preferentially presenting RBD, coupled with a labelled RBD conjugate, used in a two-step sequential assay for detection and measurement of antibody to RBD (anti-RBD). This class and species neutral assay showed a specificity of 100 % on 825 pre COVID-19 samples and a potential sensitivity of 99.6 % on 276 recovery samples, predicting quantitatively the presence of neutralising antibody determined by pseudo-type neutralization and by plaque reduction. Anti-RBD is also measurable in ferrets immunised with ChadOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and in humans immunised with both AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. This assay detects anti-RBD at presentation with illness, demonstrates its elevation with disease severity, its sequel to asymptomatic infection and its persistence after the loss of antibody to the nucleoprotein (anti-NP). It also provides serological confirmation of prior infection and offers a secure measure for seroprevalence and studies of vaccine immunisation in human and animal populations. The hybrid DABA also displays the attributes necessary for the detection and quantification of anti-RBD to be used in clinical practice.

Some of our participants showed depressive and anxious attitudes even in the absence of real pictures of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon, combined with mechanisms of emulation and conditioning, can trigger a vicious cycle within interpersonal relationships and promote the administration of unnecessary treatments. Various approaches have been proposed to help populations suffering from psychosocial problems induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, but there is an objective difficulty in treating a large population. Methods: To contain and reduce this widespread psychosocial unease, in this study we used two radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology neuromodulation treatments, neuro postural optimization (NPO) and neuropsychophysical optimization-cervicobrachial (NPPO-CB), aimed at optimizing an individual's response to the effects of environmental stressors. These treatments are quick and easy to administer; therefore, they can be administered to a large cohort of participants in a short time. To evaluate the effects of the REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments, the DASS-21 psychometric test was used because it has already been used to test depression, anxiety, and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: The results of the study confirm the usefulness of REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments in helping participants to have better coping strategies for the environmental pressures and reduce the neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Lipids, particularly ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, together form lamellar membranes in the extracellular spaces of the SC that limit the loss of water and electrolytes. In addition to preventing water and electrolyte loss, the SC as a permeability barrier prevents the entry of harmful irritants, allergens, and microorganisms into the skin. Disruption of the epidermal barrier leads to skin that is irritated, more reactive, and more sensitive than normal skin. SC thickness, lipid profile, and barrier function vary with different ethnic groups, which is also reflected the differences in prevalence and manifestation of diverse skin conditions related to the skin barrier function such as atopic dermatitis and sensitive skin.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of indicators related to access to healthcare services, in COVID-19 surveillance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A time series analysis was performed using the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 in Mainland Portugal, between weeks 14/2020 (March 30 to April 5) and 25/2020 (June 15 to 21), and six indicators: 1) COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare; 2) number of COVID-19 emergency department visits; 3) number of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; 4) number of hospitalizations due to viral pneumonia; 5) proportion of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; and 6) proportion of hospitalizations for viral pneumonia. Pearson correlation and cross-correlations were computed. RESULTS: A strong correlation was found between the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 and all indicators. [(1) 0.76; (2) 0.82; (3) 0.77; (4) 0.84; (5) 0.86; e (6) 0.90]. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia detect variations in the frequency of the disease with a one week lag compared to the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare and emergency department visits trail behind the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. The proportion of viral pneumonias in emergency department visits, or hospitalizations, is temporally aligned with the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The delay found in the COVID-19 primary healthcare consultations and emergency department visits, may be related to changes in access to healthcare services and clinical coding. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia may be useful in the early detection of COVID-19. Viral pneumonia may have been coded as being of unknown origin. Future monitoring of these indicators is necessary to ascertain whether the incidence of COVID-19 is significantly influenced by changes in testing strategies. The indicators described in this study will be an asset for the optimization of testing strategies, allocation of healthcare resources to the communities that are most vulnerable to severe morbidity and assessing vaccination impact. As such, surveillance systems based on clinical data will be a valuable complementary tool to SINAVE.

Healthy volunteers were tasked to breathe at fixed respiratory rates over a range of airway resistances generated by a flow resistor inserted within a mouthpiece. Changes in respiratory efforts, effected by the subjects and measured as airway pressures at the mouth, were compared to DPOP values derived from a finger pulse oximeter probe. It was found that the increased effort to breathe manifests itself as an associated increase in DPOP. Further, a relationship between DPOP and percent modulation of the pleth waveform was observed. A version of the DPOP algorithm that corrects for low perfusion was implemented which resulted in an improved relationship between DPOP and PPV.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old Caucasian woman with no notable past medical history presented to her primary care provider with 2 weeks of severe fatigue, anorexia, and malaise, associated with chills, night sweats, and myalgias. Peripheral blood smear identified 92% blasts consistent with acute myeloid leukemia and computed tomography identified a right segmental pulmonary embolism and thrombotic infarcts in the spleen, bilateral kidneys, right lung, and liver. Laboratory testing also demonstrated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment and subsequently developed ventricular tachycardia, anterolateral ST segment elevation, acute dysarthria, and nonreactive pupils. Pulseless electrical activity developed with unsuccessful resuscitative measures. The patient died secondary to presumed cerebrovascular and coronary thromboses causing stroke and anterolateral infarct complicated by ventricular tachycardia and pulseless electrical activity. CONCLUSION: This case is notable as a case of acute myeloid leukemia causing acute thrombosis of coronary arteries with anterolateral ST elevation myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and pulseless electrical activity. Prognosis of concomitant acute myeloid leukemia and acute myocardial infarction is poor. Management is challenging due to thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, and systemic coagulopathy, and administration of thrombolytic agents can be fatal. This is an extreme presentation of a case of acute myocardial infarction with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy causing acute coronary thrombosis and sudden death with dramatic electrocardiogram and telemetry findings recorded with rapid progression from normal sinus rhythm to acute myocardial infarction to terminal rhythm.","output":"Acute myeloid leukemia causing acute thrombosis of the coronary arteries: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pro-life advocates commonly argue that fetuses have the moral status of persons, and an accompanying right to life, a view most pro-choice advocates deny. A difficulty for this pro-life position has been Judith Jarvis Thomson's violinist analogy, in which she argues that even if the fetus is a person, abortion is often permissible because a pregnant woman is not obliged to continue to offer her body as life support. Here, we outline the moral theories underlying public health ethics, and examine the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of public health considerations overriding individual rights. We argue that if fetuses are regarded as persons, then abortion is of such prevalence in society that it also constitutes a significant public health crisis. We show that on public health considerations, we are justified in overriding individual rights to bodily autonomy by prohibiting abortion.

Prior to COVID-19, the global burden of disease attributable to sedentary behavior disproportionately affected the health of people with disabilities (PWD). This pre-existing gap has only widened during COVID-19 due to limited disability-friendly digital exercise resources. The purpose of this work is to examine this gap in accessibility to digital fitness resources, and re-frame the notion of accessibility to suit the contemporary context. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using machine learning, video titles/descriptions about home exercise ordered by relevance populated on YouTube between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020 were examined. RESULTS Using the search terms, \\"home exercise,\\" \\"home-based exercise,\\" \\"exercise no equipment,\\" \\"workout no equipment,\\" \\"exercise at home,\\" or \\"at-home exercise,\\" 700 videos ordered by relevance included 28 (4%) that were inclusive of participants with disabilities. Unfortunately, most digital fitness resources are therefore inaccessible to PWD. The global pause the pandemic has induced may be the right moment to construct a comprehensive, indexed digital library of home-based fitness video content for the disabled. There is a further need for more nuanced understandings of accessibility as technological advancements continue. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical activity is incredibly important to the quality of life and health of all people. Physical activity levels, however, remain lower among persons with disabilities. Access to disability-friendly resources remains a challenge and worsened by the circumstances of COVID-19 due to an apparent lack of digital fitness resources for persons with disabilities.

Despite their beauty, Costa Rican beaches can pose a high risk for foreign visitors: Drowning is the primary cause of unintentional death among international visitors. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of demographics, spatial and temporal trends of national and foreigner fatal drowning occurring at Costa Rican beaches during 2001C2019. For national beachgoers, teens and young male adults, ages 15C30 years are at greatest risk of drowning, while for foreigners, older adults ages 45C60 years exhibit higher risk. Temporal trends in drowning appear to be correlated with the number of beach visitors, which seem to be driven mainly by a combination of socioeconomical and climatic/weather factors. For instance, strong economic indicators for the Costa Rican population combined with good weather fostered during warm phases of El Ni?o Southern Oscillation attract more national beachgoers, which may increase the number of drowning deaths. These results will help authorities better understand the complex and dynamic drowning situation to develop better prevention strategies and policies that improve beach safety and raise awareness about coastal hazards and risk.

Objective measurement tools, specifically, wearable sensors, present the opportunity to minimize the major limitations of self-reported eating measures by generating supplementary sensor data that can improve the validity of self-report data in naturalistic settings. This scoping review summarizes the current use of wearable devices/sensors that automatically detect eating-related activity in naturalistic research settings. Five databases were searched in December 2019, and 618 records were retrieved from the literature search. This scoping review included N = 40 studies (from 33 articles) that reported on one or more wearable sensors used to automatically detect eating activity in the field. The majority of studies (N = 26, 65%) used multi-sensor systems (incorporating > 1 wearable sensors), and accelerometers were the most commonly utilized sensor (N = 25, 62.5%). All studies (N = 40, 100.0%) used either self-report or objective ground-truth methods to validate the inferred eating activity detected by the sensor(s). The most frequently reported evaluation metrics were Accuracy (N = 12) and F1-score (N = 10). This scoping review highlights the current state of wearable sensors' ability to improve upon traditional eating assessment methods by passively detecting eating activity in naturalistic settings, over long periods of time, and with minimal user interaction. A key challenge in this field, wide variation in eating outcome measures and evaluation metrics, demonstrates the need for the development of a standardized form of comparability among sensors/multi-sensor systems and multidisciplinary collaboration.","output":"Automatic, wearable-based, in-field eating detection approaches for public health research: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a growing consensus that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of melatonin are of great importance in preserving the body functions and homeostasis, with great impact in the peripartum period and adult life. Melatonin promotes adaptation through allostasis and stands out as an endogenous, dietary, and therapeutic molecule with important health benefits. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of melatonin are intertwined and are exerted throughout pregnancy and later during development and aging. Melatonin supplementation during pregnancy can reduce ischemia-induced oxidative damage in the fetal brain, increase offspring survival in inflammatory states, and reduce blood pressure in the adult offspring. In adulthood, disturbances in melatonin production negatively impact the progression of cardiovascular risk factors and promote cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The most studied cardiovascular effects of melatonin are linked to hypertension and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, while the most promising ones are linked to regaining control of metabolic syndrome components.

Several studies have highlighted that the presence of human-like physical features could lead both adults and children to anthropomorphize the robots. In the present study we aimed to compare the attribution of mental states to two humanoid robots, NAO and Robovie, which differed in the degree of anthropomorphism. Children aged 5, 7, and 9 years were required to attribute mental states to the NAO robot, which presents more human-like characteristics compared to the Robovie robot, whose physical features look more mechanical. The results on mental state attribution as a function of childrens age and robot type showed that 5-year-olds have a greater tendency to anthropomorphize robots than older children, regardless of the type of robot. Moreover, the findings revealed that, although children aged 7 and 9 years attributed a certain degree of human-like mental features to both robots, they attributed greater mental states to NAO than Robovie compared to younger children. These results generally show that children tend to anthropomorphize humanoid robots that also present some mechanical characteristics, such as Robovie. Nevertheless, age-related differences showed that they should be endowed with physical characteristics closely resembling human ones to increase older childrens perception of human likeness.

We aimed to describe clinical and serological characteristics of children with HBoV hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infection and to evaluate whether differences occur between HBoV alone and in co-infection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 60 children (median age of 6.2 months, range 0.6C70.9) hospitalized for acute respiratory symptoms, with HBoV detected from a respiratory sample, using a reverse transcriptase-PCR for 14 respiratory viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A and B, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL-63 and HUK1, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus1C3, and human metapneumovirus). RESULTS: HBoV was detected alone in 29 (48.3%) patients, while in co-infection with other viruses in 31 patients (51.7%), with a peak between December and January. Among the 60 patients, 34 were bronchiolitis, 19 wheezing, 3 pneumonia, 2 upper respiratory tract infection, and 2 whooping cough. Seven children (11.6%) required admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for respiratory failure. No differences was observed in age, family history for atopy and/or asthma, clinical presentations, chest X-ray, or laboratory findings in children with HBoV alone vs. multiple viral detection. RSV was the most frequently co-detected virus (61.3%).

Background: Long-term safety profile and efficacy in relation to the so-called microinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) techniques are still under evaluation. The XEN45? gel stent entails a bleb formation and often requires postoperative conjunctival management, differing from the current reviewed concept of minimally invasive procedures. Endophthalmitis has been described among the complications, triggered in the majority of cases by tube extrusion. Cases description: From our chart of 293 eyes operated on between November 2016 and November 2019, five (1.7%) patients developed endophthalmitis, which took place in the months 3, 4, 5, 11, and 14 after surgery, respectively. Sixty percent had undergone previous needling procedures. All of them showed a previous flat bleb and developed perforation of the conjunctiva caused by the distal portion of the tube. One patient was early eviscerated due to a fateful course. Treatment consisted of intravitreal, oral, and topical antibiotics, as well as topical corticosteroids. Eighty percent underwent device withdrawal, conjunctival gap suturing, anterior chamber washout, aqueous humor (AH) tab extraction (one positive for S. epidermidis and one for Streptococcus agalactiae), and pars plana vitrectomy. A second patient was eviscerated due to phthisis bulbi. Out of three remaining patients, one underwent vitrectomy for retinal detachment, while two patients required glaucoma surgery for intraocular pressure control. The final VA was 20/125 in all patients. Conclusion: The XEN45? device appears to trigger endophthalmitis by extruding the stent or unnoticed leakage through conjunctival defects. Special attention should be paid to flat and avascular blebs.

However, little is known about public awareness and attitudes regarding COVID-19 in China. The impact of COVID-19 on the societal well-being and anxiety levels of the public has never been documented. The aim of this study was to survey the knowledge, attitudes, impact, and anxiety levels of the people of China in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire was undertaken between Jan 24 and Feb 24, 2020. The study participants were residents of mainland China over the age of 18 years. The attitude items in this study measured the perceived threat of COVID-19 based on the Health Belief Model. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a self-reported questionnaire that measure both state (STAI-S), and trait anxiety (STAI-T) Results: A total of 2,446 completed responses were received. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total knowledge score was 20.3 (SD  2.9) out of a possible score of 23. The social disruption and household economic impact were notable, particularly in provinces with higher cumulative confirmed cases. The majority of responses indicated a low perceived susceptibility of being infected (86.7% [95%CI 85.4C88.1]), with a fair proportion of respondents perceiving a higher severity (62.9% [95% CI 61.0C64.8]). The mean total impact score was 9.9 (SD  3.8) out of a possible score of 15. The mean score for STAI-S was 48.7 (SD  10.8), whereas the mean STAI-T score was 45.7 (SD  8.5). By demographics, women reported significantly higher odds for higher levels of both STAI-S (OR = 1.67) and STAI-T (OR = 1.30) compared to men. People of a younger age were also more likely to experience higher STAI-S and STAI-T. Higher perceived susceptibility and severity and impact were strong predictors of higher levels of STAI-S and STAI-T. Conclusion: Our findings can assist in tailoring public communication to change people's knowledge and attitudes. The present study also underlined the importance of the promotion of mental health during infectious disease outbreaks to help in moderating the perceived threat, social and household economic impact, targeting the vulnerable segment of the population.","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes, Impact, and Anxiety Regarding COVID-19 Infection Among the Public in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is one of the very contagious diseases from the family Coronaviridae and spreading at a faster rate in the community.

Available treatments only target the inflammatory component with minimal impact on joint repair. We recently uncovered a previously unappreciated family of pro-resolving mediators, the maresin conjugate in tissue regeneration (MCTR), that display both immunoregulatory and tissue-protective activities. Thus, we queried whether the production of these autacoids is disrupted in RA patients and whether they can be useful in treating joint inflammation and promoting joint repair. METHODS: Using a highly phenotyped RA cohort we evaluated plasma MCTR concentrations and correlated these to clinical markers of disease activity. To evaluate the immunoregulatory and tissue reparative activities we employed both in vivo models of arthritis and organ culture models. FINDINGS: Herein, we observed that plasma MCTR3 concentrations were negatively correlated with joint disease activity and severity in RA patients. Evaluation of the mechanisms engaged by this mediator in arthritic mice demonstrated that MCTR3 reprograms monocytes to confer enduring joint protective properties. Single cell transcriptomic profiling and flow cytometric evaluation of macrophages from mice treated with MCTR3-reprogrammed monocytes revealed a role for Arginase-1 (Arg-1) in mediating their joint reparative and pro-resolving activities. Arg-1 inhibition reversed both the anti-arthritic and tissue reparative actions of MCTR3-reprogrammed monocytes. INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that circulating MCTR3 levels are negatively correlated with disease in RA. When administered to mice in vivo, MCTR3 displayed both anti-inflammatory and joint reparative activities, protecting both cartilage and bone in murine arthritis. These activities were, at least in part, mediated via the reprogramming of mononuclear phagocyte responses.

Avian influenza outbreaks in downwind areas of Asian dust storms (ADS) suggest that viruses might be transported by dust storms. OBJECTIVES: We developed a technique to measure ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses. We then used this technique to measure concentrations of these viruses on ADS days and background days, and to assess the relationships between ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses, and air pollutants. METHODS: A high-volume air sampler was used in parallel with a filter cassette to evaluate spiked samples and unspiked samples. Then, air samples were monitored during ADS seasons using a filter cassette coupled with a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Air samples were monitored during ADS season (1 January to 31 May 2006). RESULTS: We successfully quantified ambient influenza virus using the filtration/real-time qPCR method during ADS days and background days. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the concentration of influenza virus in ambient air. In both the spiked and unspiked samples, the concentration of influenza virus sampled using the filter cassette was higher than that using the high-volume sampler. The concentration of ambient influenza A virus was significantly higher during the ADS days than during the background days.

EBTs are well positioned to fill an important gap in the management of obesity and metabolic disease. The purpose of this expert review is to update gastroenterologists on these therapies and provide practice advice on how to incorporate them into clinical practice. METHODS The evidence reviewed in this work is a distillation of comprehensive search of several English-language databases and a manual review of relevant publications (including systematic reviews and meeting abstracts). Best Practice Advice 1: EBTs should be considered in patients with obesity who have been unsuccessful in losing or maintaining weight loss with lifestyle interventions. Best Practice Advice 2: EBTs can be used in patients with severe obesity as a bridge to traditional bariatric surgery. They also can be used as a bridge to allow unrelated interventions that are unable to be performed because of weight limits (ie, orthopedic surgery, organ transplantation). Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should use EBTs as part of a structured weight loss program that includes dietary intervention, exercise therapy, and behavior modification, in both the active weight loss phase and the long-term maintenance phase. Best Practice Advice 4: Clinicians should screen all potential EBT candidates with a comprehensive evaluation for medical conditions, comorbidities, and psychosocial or behavioral patterns that contribute to their condition before enrolling patients in a weight loss program that includes EBTs. Best Practice Advice 5: Clinicians incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should follow up patients prospectively to capture the impact of the EBT program on weight and weight-related comorbidities, and all related adverse outcomes. Poor responders should be identified and offered a detailed evaluation and alternative therapy. Best Practice Advice 6: Clinicians embarking on incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should have a comprehensive knowledge of the indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and outcomes of individual EBTs, as well as a practical knowledge of the risks and benefits of alternative therapies for obesity.

In this work, a health care provider wants to detect infected people as well as people who recovered from the disease as quickly as possible. In order to measure the timeliness of the tracking process, we use the long-term average difference between the actual infection status of the people and their real-time estimate by the health care provider based on the most recent test results. We first find an analytical expression for this average difference for given test rates, and given infection and recovery rates of people. Next, we propose an alternating minimization based algorithm to minimize this average difference. We observe that if the total test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the population equally, only a portion of the population is tested based on their infection and recovery rates. We also observe that increasing the total test rate helps track the infection status better. In addition, an increased population size increases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates, which may be exploited to spend testing capacity more efficiently, thereby improving the system performance. Finally, depending on the health care provider's preferences, test rate allocation can be altered to detect either the infected people or the recovered people more quickly.","output":"Timely Tracking of Infection Status of Individuals in a Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multidrug resistance in microbes poses a major health crisis and demands for the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents.

The aim was to analyze the distribution of chemical-biological variables in a multi-basin lake as a result of internal and external physical drivers and constrains. Lake Como has a y-like shape encompassing three main sub-basins: northern, south-eastern, and south-western. Field data underlined: the presence of chemical-biological gradients between the south-western basin and the rest of the lake and the propagation of a fresher water-plume (formed by the two main northern inflows) into the northern basin and then into the south-western closed arm. The use of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model showed a periodic movement of this plume that tends to enter the south-western basin first and then to return toward north, moving forward and back through the junction of the three arms. The entrance into the eastern basin, instead, occurs only secondarily. Wavelet transform analysis revealed common periodicity between the plume movement and the action of different external and internal lake-stressors, including: the discharge of the main inflow (period centered at 1, 3.3, and 6.5 day), the wind intensity (0.5 and 1 day) and the two main basin-scale internal wave motions: (3.3 day and 7.1 day). The periodic movement of the fresher water-plume enhances the water exchange and reduces the chemical-biological gradients between the western closed basin and the main lake, playing a crucial role in distributing both inorganic and organic materials at the lake basin-scale.","output":"Generation and dispersion of chemical and biological gradients in a large-deep multi-basin lake (Lake Como, north Italy): The joint effect of external drivers and internal wave motions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As an immune modulator, vitamin D has been implicated in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcome.

Indeed, to date, a well-established therapy is still lacking. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) added to standard care in patients with COVID-19. This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial conducted at three major university hospitals in Egypt. One hundred ninety-four patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study after signing informed consent. They were equally randomized into two arms: 97 patients administrated HCQ plus standard care (HCQ group) and 97 patients administered only standard care as a control arm (control group). The primary endpoints were recovery within 28 days, need for mechanical ventilation, or death. The two groups were matched for age and gender. There was no significant difference between them regarding any of the baseline characteristics or laboratory parameters. Four patients (4.1%) in the HCQ group and 5 (5.2%) patients in the control group needed mechanical ventilation (P = 0.75). The overall mortality did not differ between the two groups, as six patients (6.2%) died in the HCQ group and 5 (5.2%) died in the control group (P = 0.77). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that HCQ treatment was not significantly associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients. So, adding HCQ to standard care did not add significant benefit, did not decrease the need for ventilation, and did not reduce mortality rates in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Live vaccines can generate false-positive results on common influenza assays including reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), culture and antigen tests. This threatens the integrity of epidemiological data and may misdirect treatment and control efforts.

Primers were validated using influenza-positive samples from unvaccinated patients, packaged FMV, and one PCR-positive asymptomatic vaccine. Furthermore, the assay was used to experimentally test our lab's collection of influenza-positive samples from the 2004C05 and 2005C06 influenza seasons and several 2005 preseason isolates to determine the rate of vaccine-derived false-positive results under differing epidemiological conditions. Analytical and clinical validations show that the assay is both sensitive and specific. Experimental results demonstrate that 51 out of 51 influenza-positive samples collected during influenza season from ill, previously-vaccinated military personnel represent real infections with circulating strains. Finally, the assay shows that four preseason influenza-positive samples were false positives resulting from vaccine shedding. The vaccine-discriminatory RT-PCR methods described here provide the first test designed to distinguish FMV strains from circulating strains.

Previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) beta-coronavirus infections have been associated with tachyarrhythmias and signs and symptoms of heart failure. The emergence of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, has rapidly developed into a pandemic, and a large number of infected patients have been reported to have underlying cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: Since there are only scant published data regarding cardiovascular burden in the wake of viral epidemics, this study aimed to evaluate cardiac involvement in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 40 adult inpatients at two centers in Germany. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were included in the study, which focused on the potential cardiac involvement of SARS-CoV-2. It was based on laboratory parameters as well as electro- and echocardiographic values to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus on heart tissues. RESULTS: The conducted investigations confirmed the relationship between the presence of acute cardiac injury and COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Myocardial injury and impaired myocardial function due to COVID-19 are common; however, no correlation was established between cardiac laboratory or echocardiographic values and mortality.

This reduced capacity, along with public reluctance to undergo endoscopy during the pandemic, might result in excess mortality from delayed cancer diagnosis. Using the UK's National Endoscopy Database (NED), we performed the first national analysis of the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services and endoscopic cancer diagnosis. DESIGN: We developed a NED COVID-19 module incorporating procedure-level data on all endoscopic procedures. Three periods were designated: pre-COVID (6 January 2020 to 15 March), transition (16-22 March) and COVID-impacted (23 March-31 May). National, regional and procedure-specific analyses were performed. The average weekly number of cancers, proportion of missing cancers and cancer detection rates were calculated. RESULTS: A weekly average of 35 478 endoscopy procedures were performed in the pre-COVID period. Activity in the COVID-impacted period reduced to 12% of pre-COVID levels; at its low point, activity was only 5%, recovering to 20% of pre-COVID activity by study end. Although more selective vetting significantly increased the per-procedure cancer detection rate (pre-COVID 1.91%; COVID-impacted 6.61%; p<0.001), the weekly number of cancers detected decreased by 58%. The proportion of missing cancers ranged from 19% (pancreatobiliary) to 72% (colorectal). CONCLUSION: This national analysis demonstrates the remarkable impact that the pandemic has had on endoscopic services, which has resulted in a substantial and concerning reduction in cancer detection. Major, urgent efforts are required to restore endoscopy capacity to prevent an impending cancer healthcare crisis.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK endoscopic activity and cancer detection: a National Endoscopy Database Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In addition to the psychological impact of quarantine, there are sleep disturbances that must be taken into account by implementing appropriate strategies in order to maintain good mental and general health.

In this International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) communication, we examined the importance of identifying the underlying disorder causing DIC to help physicians in the diagnosis and management of this common and severe condition. METHODS Eight DIC experts participated in a three-step consensus process that searched for published guidelines and diagnostic scores on DIC to create a preliminary list of DIC underlying disorders from those reported in the literature Overall, 13 papers were identified, including three guidelines, one harmonization paper by the ISTH, one ISTH recommendation paper on cancer-associated DIC, five general diagnostic scores, two scores specific for pregnancy, and one specific for children. We then assessed the strength of the evidence on the association between the disease and DIC as many postulated DIC-associated disorders are rare. KEY RESULTS Eight main subgroups - 'severe infection', 'solid tumour', 'haematological neoplasia', 'pregnancy complication', 'vascular disease', 'newborn-complication', 'tissue damage due to internal or external insult', and 'chemical and biological agent' - and a detailed list of specific causes of DIC were provided. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Our results suggest more data are needed to determine the association between DIC and specific diseases such as malignant lymphoma, colorectal cancer, or vasculitis, for which the evidence remains limited. When a patient develops a coagulopathy consistent with DIC, the first step is to immediately search for an underlying disorder, including specific causes that are rarely associated with DIC and to consider that patients may have more than one cause of DIC to identify the principal precipitating disorder to prioritize treatment.","output":"Underlying disorders of disseminated intravascular coagulation: Communication from the ISTH SSC Subcommittees on Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation and Perioperative and Critical Care Thrombosis and Hemostasis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work demonstrates the presence of immune regulatory cells in the cervical lymph nodes draining Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccinated site on the dorsum of the ear in guinea pigs.

Besides, T cells from these lymph nodes separated as a non-adherent fraction on a nylon wool column, proliferated to PPD in the presence of autologous antigen presenting cells. Interestingly, addition of as low as 20% nylon wool adherent cells to these, sharply decreased the proliferation by 83%. Looking into what cells in the adherent fraction suppressed the proliferation, it was found that neither the T cell nor the macrophage enriched cell fractions of this population individually showed suppressive effect, indicating that their co-presence was necessary for the suppression. Since BCG induced granulomas resolve much faster than granulomas induced by other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae the present experimental findings add to the existing evidence that intradermal BCG vaccination influences subsequent immune responses in the host and may further stress upon its beneficial role seen in Covid-19 patients.","output":"Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccine generates immunoregulatory cells in the cervical lymph nodes in guinea pigs injected intra dermally"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization, which proclaimed the COVID-19 a pandemic in early March 2020, imposed a partial lockdown by the Government of India on 21 March 2020.

Although endogenous mRNA is also 5-triphosphorylated, backbone modifications and the 5-ppp-linked methylguanosine ((m7)G) cap prevent immunorecognition. Here we show that the methylation status of endogenous capped mRNA at the 5-terminal nucleotide (N(1)) was crucial to prevent RIG-I activation. Moreover, we identified a single conserved amino acid (H830) in the RIG-I RNA binding pocket as the mediator of steric exclusion of N(1)-2O-methylated RNA. H830A alteration (RIG-I(H830A)) restored binding of N(1)-2O-methylated pppRNA. Consequently, endogenous mRNA activated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not wild-type RIG-I. Similarly, knockdown of the endogenous N(1)-2O-methyltransferase led to considerable RIG-I stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Studies involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2O-methyltransferase and RIG-I(H830A) revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape RIG-I.

The new virus was taxonomically designed as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cell invasion, which is expressed in different tissues including lungs, small intestine, testicles, kidneys, brain, and the eye. The purpose of this article is to review the available information on the relationship of COVID-19 with the eye, as well as evaluating the possible usefulness of ocular diagnostic tests to help in the diagnosis and/or monitoring of patients with this disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of relevant articles from November 2019 to April 2020. RESULTS: Ocular infection by SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial; nevertheless, the possibility of being a viral reservoir has been suggested, increasing the likelihood of infection. Some reports demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, and previously published data suggest a pathological increase of cytokine concentrations in COVID-19 patients; the cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm contributes to lung and central nervous system damage. The usefulness of tears for the measurement of inflammatory cytokines in various diseases is well known, in particular IL-6, which has been correlated to the severity of COVID-19.

Data sampling took place in the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Only data pertaining to individuals who were soft contact lens wearers were included. Data were extracted for questions relating to contact lens wearing habits pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and expectations for future lens wear beyond the pandemic. RESULTS: Seven-hundred and twenty-eight individuals were identified as soft contact lens wearers of which six-hundred and nineteen wore a combination of contact lenses and spectacles. Most respondents indicated contact lens wear times had either remained the same (57.3%) or increased (9.8%) during the pandemic. The country with the greatest proportion of respondents decreasing wear time during COVID-19 was the UK (45.3%), and the least in the Netherlands (20.0%). The primary cause of decreased lens wear was attributed to leaving the home less often (70.0%), and the second most common reason due to concerns about hygiene (10.8%).

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are significant causes of seasonal respiratory illness in children. The incidence of influenza and RSV hospitalization is well documented, but the incidence of medically attended, laboratory-confirmed illness has not been assessed in a well defined community cohort. Methods. Children aged 6C59 months with medically attended acute respiratory illness were prospectively enrolled during the 2006C2007 through 2009C2010 influenza seasons in a Wisconsin community cohort. Nasal swabs were tested for RSV and influenza by multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The population incidence of medically attended RSV and influenza was estimated separately and standardized to weeks 40 through 18 of each season. Results. The cohort included 2800C3073 children each season. There were 2384 children enrolled with acute respiratory illness; 627 (26%) were positive for RSV and 314 (13%) for influenza. The mean age was 28 months (standard deviation [SD] = 15) for RSV-positive and 38 months (SD = 16) for influenza-positive children. Seasonal incidence (cases per 10 000) was 1718 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1602C1843) for RSV and 768 (95% CI, 696C848) for influenza.

First, we evaluate the rate of recurrence of computational TFBS predictions by commonly used sampling procedures. We find that the vast majority of results are biologically meaningless. However clustering results based on nucleotide position improves predictive power. Additionally, we find that positional clustering increases robustness to long or imperfectly selected input sequences. Positional clustering can also be used as a mechanism to integrate results from multiple sampling approaches for improvements in accuracy over each one alone. Finally, we predict and validate regulatory sequences partially responsible for transcriptional control of the mammalian type A -aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)R) subunit genes. Positional clustering is useful for improving computational binding site predictions, with potential application to improving our understanding of mammalian gene expression. In particular, predicted regulatory mechanisms in the mammalian GABA(A)R subunit gene family may open new avenues of research towards understanding this pharmacologically important neurotransmitter receptor system.","output":"Positional clustering improves computational binding site detection and identifies novel cis-regulatory sites in mammalian GABA(A) receptor subunit genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza virus and coronavirus epidemics or pandemics have occurred in succession worldwide throughout the early 21st century.

The goal of this session was to perform systems testing, using a simulation-based evaluation to identify areas in need of improvement. METHODS: Four simulation cases were designed to depict common and high acuity situations encountered in the ACH, using a high technology simulator and standardized patient. A multidisciplinary observer group was given debriefing forms listing the objectives, critical actions, and specific areas to focus their attention. These forms were compiled for data collection. RESULTS: Logistical, operational, and patient safety issues were identified during the simulation and compiled into a simulation event report. Proposed solutions and protocol changes were made in response to the identified issues.

Antibiotic treatment was only initiated if additional clinical signs or the microbiological culture results pointed to the likelihood of an infection. Treatment was either empirically based (broad-spectrum) or specific (narrow-spectrum). If a causative agent was identified, therapy was adjusted accordingly.

While the vaccine is now available, social acceptance remains relatively uncertain in many societies. The purpose of this study was to examine the beliefs, attitudes and practices associated with the intention to get vaccinated against the A/H1N1 virus among the general population in France. Methods: A representative sample of 1001 individuals (stratified random recruitment procedure, ages 16C90 years) was interviewed by telephone. The questionnaire included a variety of items associated with socio-demographic characteristics, risk perceptions, illness perceptions, political attitudes and worldviews as well as intention to get vaccinated. Results: More than 6 out of 10 of the respondents indicated that they planned to get vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available. The same proportion of parents also reported the intention to vaccinate their children against the disease. In multiple regression analyses, socio-cognitive factors consistently predicting influenza A/H1N1 vaccination were: level of worry, risk perception and previous experience of vaccine against seasonal flu. Conclusions: The factors found to predict vaccination intention and their distribution are assumed to be a consequence of the fact that people perceive the risk of swine flu to be similar to that of seasonal flu. As a result, in the absence of an increase of the risk perception of pandemic influenza A/H1N1, a very low level of actual vaccination is forecasted.

In this paper, we explore strategies that such institutions can adopt to conduct safe reopening and resume operations during the pandemic. The research is motivated by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigns (UIUCs) SHIELD program, which is a set of policies and strategies, including rapid saliva-based COVID-19 screening, for ensuring safety of students, faculty and staff to conduct in-person operations, at least partially. Specifically, we study how rapid bulk testing, contact tracing and preventative measures such as mask wearing, sanitization, and enforcement of social distancing can allow institutions to manage the epidemic spread. This work combines the power of analytical epidemic modeling, data analysis and agent-based simulations to derive policy insights. We develop an analytical model that takes into account the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, the effect of isolation via testing (both in bulk and through contact tracing) and the rate of contacts among people within and outside the institution. Next, we use data from the UIUC SHIELD program and 85 other universities to estimate parameters that describe the analytical model. Using the estimated parameters, we finally conduct agent-based simulations with various model parameters to evaluate testing and reopening strategies. The parameter estimates from UIUC and other universities show similar trends. For example, infection rates at various institutions grow rapidly in certain months and this growth correlates positively with infection rates in counties where the universities are located. Infection rates are also shown to be negatively correlated with testing rates at the institutions. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that the key to designing an effective reopening strategy is a combination of rapid bulk testing and effective preventative measures such as mask wearing and social distancing. Multiple other factors help to reduce infection load, such as efficient contact tracing, reduced delay between testing and result revelation, tests with less false negatives and targeted testing of high-risk class among others. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on combating the COVID-19 pandemic and is especially relevant for educational institutions and similarly large organizations. We contribute by providing an analytical model that can be used to estimate key parameters from data, which in turn can be used to simulate the effect of different strategies for reopening. We quantify the relative effect of different strategies such as bulk testing, contact tracing, reduced infectivity and contact rates in the context of educational institutions. Specifically, we show that for the estimated average base infectivity of 0.025 ([Formula: see text] ), a daily number of tests to population ratio T/N of 0.2, i.e., once a week testing for all individuals, is a good indicative threshold. However, this test to population ratio is sensitive to external infectivities, internal and external mobilities, delay in getting results after testing, and measures related to mask wearing and sanitization, which affect the base infection rate.","output":"Evaluation of reopening strategies for educational institutions during COVID-19 through agent based simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the experiences and needs of caregivers of persons with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in a city in India.

Current hypotheses speculate that CDV uses the homologous cellular receptors of measles virus (MeV), SLAM and nectin-4, to initiate the infection process. For validation, here, we established the well-differentiated air-liquid interface (ALI) culture model from primary canine tracheal airway epithelial cells. By applying the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing CDV vaccine strain and recombinant wild-type viruses, we show that cell-free virus infects the airway epithelium mainly via the paracellular route and only after prior disruption of tight junctions by pretreatment with EGTA; this infection was related to nectin-4 but not to SLAM. Remarkably, when CDV-preinfected DH82 cells were cocultured on the basolateral side of canine ALI cultures grown on filter supports with a 1.0-m pore size, cell-associated CDV could be transmitted via cell-to-cell contact from immunocytes to airway epithelial cultures. Finally, we observed that canine ALI cultures formed syncytia and started to release cell-free infectious viral particles from the apical surface following treatment with an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (ruxolitinib). Our findings show that CDV can overcome the epithelial barrier through different strategies, including infection via immunocyte-mediated transmission and direct infection via the paracellular route when tight junctions are disrupted. Our established model can be adapted to other animals for studying the transmission routes and the pathogenicity of other morbilliviruses.","output":"Overcoming the Barrier of the Respiratory Epithelium during Canine Distemper Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To prevent spreading of the COVID-19 infection, many countries have implemented a nationwide school closure. We aimed to assess the prevalence of behavioral problems in school-aged children during home confinement. METHODS: We conducted an internet-based survey involving 1264 children (grades 2-6) and their parents from two primary schools between February 25 and March 8, 2020, in Hubei province, China. Behavioral problems were evaluated using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). RESULTS: The prevalence of prosocial behaviors among children was 10.3%, followed by total difficulty (8.2%), conduct problems (7.0%), peer problems (6.6%), hyperactivity-inattention (6.3%) and emotional problems (4.7%). Compared with children who did not exercise, children with psychical activity had a lower hyperactivity-inattention risk (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.44 for 1-2 days/week; OR: 0.56 for more than 2 days/week) and less prosocial behaviors problems (OR: 0.65 for 1-2 days/week; OR: 0.55 for more than 2 days/week). Children of parents with anxious symptoms were associated with increased risks of emotional symptoms and total difficulty (OR: 5.64 and 3.78, respectively). LIMITATIONS: We adopted self-report questionnaires and did not collect baseline information before COVID-19 outbreak. The potential self-selection bias inherent in the study should be noted. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of behavioral problems among school-aged children varied from 4.7% to 10.3% in home quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak.

A systematic search of randomised trials was performed on Medline, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Library and Scopus to provide a comprehensive outlook and review the impact of health apps on CD. We identified 69 studies on diabetes (n = 29), cardiovascular diseases (n = 13), chronic respiratory diseases (n = 13), cancer (n = 10) or their combinations (n = 4).

Apps differed significantly in content, with a median of eight behaviour change techniques adopted, most frequently pertaining to the Feedback and monitoring (91%) and Shaping knowledge (72%) categories. As for the study methodologies, all studies adopted a traditional randomised control trial (RCT) design, with relatively short follow-ups and limited sample sizes. Findings were not significant for the majority of studies across all CD, with most RCTs revealing a high risk of bias.

Communities with higher levels of relational and cognitive social capital were especially successful in lowering COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations than communities with lower social capital between late March and early April. A difference of one standard deviation in relational social capital corresponded to a reduction of 30% in the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded. After April 2020, differentials in COVID-19 deaths related to relational social capital persisted although they became progressively less pronounced. By contrast, the period of March-April 2020, our estimates suggest that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of deaths recorded in areas with different levels of cognitive social capital. In fact, from late June-early July onwards the number of new deaths recorded as being due to COVID-19 was higher in communities with higher levels of cognitive social capital.

In lieu of paucity of experimental data, tools and the very basic understanding of host immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, well thought effective measures are needed to control COVID-19 pandemic. We have identified specific overlapping antigenic peptide epitopes (OAPE) within the 4 structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 predictive of triggering robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in host using bio-informatics tools (NetMHC4.0, IEDB, and Vaxijen2.0). We speculate an early release of pro-inflammatory cytokines for protection and later release of anti-inflammatory cytokines for prevention of immunopathology in designing a vaccine for Covid-19. Therefore, the selected immunogenic OAPE were subjected to in silico tools (IL-6-Pred, IFNepitope and PIP-EL) for analyzing their pro-inflammatory response. The OAPEs found to be pro-inflammatory in nature were further subjected to prediction servers (IL-4-Pred, IL-10-Pred, Pre-AIP) to characterize them as inducers of anti-inflammatory response as well. We finally filtered out 12 OAPE which had affinity for both CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as were inducers of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. On confirmation of OAPE binding affinity for respective T cell specific MHC allele using docking studies (pepATTRACT, Hex8.0 and Discovery studio) they were found to be have more immunogenic potential than the 3 negative control peptides (NCPs) included in the study. Additionally, we constructed CTxB-adjuvanated multi-epitopic vaccine inclusive of the 12 OAPEs which was non-toxic, non-allergenic and capable of inducing both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. A successful in silico cloning and docking of modeled subunit vaccine construct with toll like receptor-2 (TLR-2) confirmed the high efficacy of our multi-epitopic vaccine which can through a balanced interplay of cytokines help in creating a steady-state immune equilibrium. In silico immune simulation studies with the vaccine using C-ImmSim server also showed higher percentage of T cells along with production of pro-inflammatory as well as some anti-inflammatory cytokines.

The current choice of molecular methods for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes nucleic acid-based testing (NAT) for viral genetic material and antigen-based testing for viral protein identification. Host exposure is detected using antibody detection assays. While NATs require sophisticated instrument and trained manpower, antigen tests are plagued by their low sensitivity and specificity. Thus, a test offering sensitive detection for presence of infection as a colorimetric readout holds promise to enable mass testing in resource constrained environments by minimally trained personnel. Here we present a novel HRPZyme Assisted Recognition of Infection by Optical Measurement (HARIOM) assay which combines specificity of NATs with sensitivity of enzymatic assays resulting in enhanced signal to noise ratios in an easily interpretable colorimetric readout. Using this assay, we could detect up to 10(2) copies of synthetic viral RNA spiked in saliva as a detection matrix. Validating our assay on suspected human subjects, we found concordance with PCR based readouts with visible colorimetric distinction between positive and negative samples in less than an hour.

To investigate the immune characteristics of early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and possible key prognostic factors for early identification of critical COVID-19, a retrospective study including 121 children with COVID-19 was conducted. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subset counts, T cell-derived cytokine concentrations, inflammatory factor concentrations, and routine blood counts were analyzed statistically at the initial presentation. Results: The T lymphocyte subset and natural killer cell counts decreased with increasing disease severity. Group III (critical cases) had a higher Th/Tc ratio than groups I and II (common and severe cases);group I had a higher B cell count than groups II and III. IL-6, IL-10, IFN-, SAA, and procalcitonin levels increased with disease severity. Hemoglobin concentration, and RBC and eosinophil counts decreased with disease severity. Groups II and III had significantly lower lymphocyte counts than group I. T, Th, Tc, IL-6, IL-10, RBC, and hemoglobin had relatively high contribution and area under the curve values. Conclusions: Decreased T, Th, Tc, RBC, hemoglobin and increased IL-6 and IL-10 in early SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are valuable indices for early diagnosis of disease severity.

PURPOSE: A regional task force of health-system pharmacy leaders was created to assist with successful adoption of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) general chapter <800>. SUMMARY: A group of pharmacy leaders in the Kansas City region identified potential benefits to healthcare personnel and patients if hazardous drug handling procedures were standardized. A task force was created, a preimplementation survey was distributed, and meetings were held monthly to discuss sections of USP <800> identified as the most challenging to implement. The task force focused on an assessment of risk tool, hot topics, cleanroom design, and a detailed analysis of controversial medications. After the first year of meetings, a postimplementation survey was distributed, and the results were analyzed. The task force created significant value for the participants and achieved the goal of facilitating efficient USP <800> implementation resulting in greater compliance and consistency across the multiple health systems represented. Over 5,100 beds and 200 clinic sites were affected by this task force's efforts. Nearly three-fourths (73%) of respondents reported that the task force was \\"extremely helpful,\\" and the majority (64%) of respondents adopted most or all (81%-100%) of the task force's assessment of risk choices. Prioritization of tasks, information sharing, and decision-making were areas where the individual leaders were most supported. CONCLUSION: Creating a structure to eliminate barriers and facilitate collaboration among regional pharmacy leaders provided a framework for successful implementation of USP <800> requirements.

The vicious tentacles of the disease have been disseminated worldwide with unknown complications and repercussions. Advanced COVID-19 syndrome is characterized by the uncontrolled and elevated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressed immunity, leading to the cytokine storm. The uncontrolled and dysregulated secretion of inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines is positively associated with the severity of the viral infection and mortality rate. The secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 leads to a hyperinflammatory response by recruiting macrophages, T and B cells in the lung alveolar cells. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that immune cells such as macrophages recruit inflammatory monocytes in the alveolar cells and allow the production of large amounts of cytokines in the alveoli, leading to a hyperinflammatory response in severely ill patients with COVID-19. This cascade of events may lead to multiple organ failure, acute respiratory distress, or pneumonia. Although the disease has a higher survival rate than other chronic diseases, the incidence of complications in the geriatric population are considerably high, with more systemic complications. This review sheds light on the pivotal roles played by various inflammatory markers in COVID-19-related complications. Different molecular pathways, such as the activation of JAK and JAK/STAT signaling are crucial in the progression of cytokine storm;hence, various mechanisms, immunological pathways, and functions of cytokines and other inflammatory markers have been discussed. A thorough understanding of cytokines' molecular pathways and their activation procedures will add more insight into understanding immunopathology and designing appropriate drugs, therapies, and control measures to counter COVID-19. Recently, anti-inflammatory drugs and several antiviral drugs have been reported as effective therapeutic drug candidates to control hypercytokinemia or cytokine storm. Hence, the present review also discussed prospective anti-inflammatory and relevant immunomodulatory drugs currently in various trial phases and their possible implications.","output":"Role of Inflammatory Cytokines in COVID-19 Patients: A Review on Molecular Mechanisms, Immune Functions, Immunopathology and Immunomodulatory Drugs to Counter Cytokine Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Myopia is a condition in which the visual images come to a focus in front of the retina of the eye. This disease is a major cause of visual disability, which presents in 108 million persons globally.

METHODS: This is an observational analytical study that made use of a cross-sectional design. A total of 59 participants with refractive errors underwent treatment at Hasanuddin University Hospital and 116 eyes were measured and analyzed. The choroidal thickness was measured using the Enhance Depth Imaging OCT (EDI-OCT) tool, which is divided into nine observational areas. Furthermore, all data obtained were compared using statistical analysis, such as the one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between the choroidal thickness with axial length (p < 0.05) and myopia degrees (p < 0.05).

Despite its associated significant morbidity and mortality, there are no definitive cures and no fully preventative measures to combat SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the urgency to identify the pathobiological mechanisms underlying increased risk for and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mounting. One contributing factor, the accumulation of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules, is a leading trigger for the activation of nuclear factor-kB and the IRF (interferon regulatory factors), such as IRF7. Activation of these pathways, particularly in the lung and other organs, such as the heart, contributes to a burst of cytokine release, which predisposes to significant tissue damage, loss of function, and mortality. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) binds damage-associated molecular patterns is expressed in the lung and heart, and in priming organs, such as the blood vessels (in diabetes) and adipose tissue (in obesity), and transduces the pathological signals emitted by damage-associated molecular patterns. It is proposed that damage-associated molecular pattern-RAGE enrichment in these priming tissues, and in the lungs and heart during active infection, contributes to the widespread tissue damage induced by SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the RAGE axis might play seminal roles in and be a target for therapeutic intervention in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Journey to a Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products Connection in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: With Stops Along the Way in the Lung, Heart, Blood Vessels, and Adipose Tissue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entire globe has been fighting the COVID-19 pandemic for the last two years including India.

Mentorship has been proposed as one way to improve the retention and experiences of URiM physicians and trainees. The objective of this systematic review was to identify and describe mentoring programs for URiM physicians in academic medicine and to describe important themes from existing literature that can aid in the development of URiM mentorship programs. METHODS: The authors searched PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Cochrane databases, and included original publications that described a US mentorship program involving academic medical doctors at the faculty or trainee level and were created for physicians who are URiM or provided results stratified by race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Our search yielded 4,548 unique citations and 31 publications met our inclusion criteria. Frequently cited objectives of these programs were to improve research skills, to diversify representation in specific fields, and to recruit and retain URiM participants. Subjective outcomes were primarily participant satisfaction with the program and/or work climate. The dyad model of mentoring was the most common, though several novel models were also described. Program evaluations were primarily subjective and reported high satisfaction, although some reported objective outcomes including publications, retention, and promotion. All showed satisfactory outcomes for the mentorship programs. DISCUSSION: This review describes a range of successful mentoring programs for URiM physicians. Our recommendations based on our review include the importance of institutional support for diversity, tailoring programs to local needs and resources, training mentors, and utilizing URiM and non-URiM mentors.

Their apparent brittleness under uniaxial loading, however, is still a major obstacle to their industrialization. Moreover, BMGs often contain crystalline defects developed, intentionally or not, during their complex and delicate elaboration. These flaws are known to affect their fracture toughness and their plastic behaviour. This paper reviews twenty years of works about this subject on Zr-based bulk metallic glasses that may contain a low volume fraction of crystalline defects of different natures, e.g. dendrites or spherulites, depending on the synthesis method. Dedicated experimental set-ups, mainly bending tests on notched beams, were developed to create in the specimen a proper pre-crack by fatigue and then load it monotonically up to fracture. The measured fracture toughness and the fractographic observations allow to conclude that these crystalline defects facilitate pre-cracking, but result in an embrittlement that is more or less significant depending on their type. The loading mode of the crack -- mode I, II or mixed -- as well as the temperature were shown to play a key role in crack initiation and propagation, whether steadily or catastrophically, in the BMG. By means of finite element computations analyses, explanations on how the crystalline flaws presence can affect fracture toughness and perturbate crack growth, under mode I and mode II, were proposed.Finally, the relevance of these experimental techniques as well as the link between crystalline defects, fracture toughness and their consequences on the ductility of a structural component are discussed.","output":"Crystalline defects in bulk metallic glasses: consequences on fracture toughness determination and ductility."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A computational approach to in silico drug discovery was carried out to identify small drug-like compounds able to show structural and functional mimicry of the high affinity ligand X77, potent non-covalent inhibitor of SARS-COV-2 main protease (M(Pro)). In doing so, the X77-mimetic candidates were predicted based on the crystal X77-M(Pro) structure by a public web-oriented virtual screening platform Pharmit. Models of these candidates bound to SARS-COV-2 M(Pro) were generated by molecular docking, quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. At the final point, analysis of the interaction modes of the identified compounds with M(Pro) and prediction of their binding affinity were carried out. Calculation revealed 5 top-ranking compounds that exhibited a high affinity to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro). Insights into the ligand ? M(Pro) models indicate that all identified compounds may effectively block the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(Pro), in line with the low values ??of binding free energy and dissociation constant. Mechanism of binding of these compounds to M(Pro) is mainly provided by van der Waals interactions with the functionally important residues of the enzyme, such as His-41, Met-49, Cys-145, Met-165, and Gln-189 that play a role of the binding hot spots assisting the predicted molecules to effectively interact with the M(Pro) active site.

In this study we characterized the volume kinetics of Ringer's lactate solution in patients undergoing open gastrectomy. When propofol and remifentanil reached a pseudosteady state at the target concentration and blood pressure was stabilized following surgical stimulation, enrolled patients were administered 1000 mL of Ringer's lactate solution for 20 min, followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 6 mL/kg/h until the time of the last blood collection for volume kinetic analysis. Arterial blood samples were collected to measure the hemoglobin concentration at different time points. The change in hemoglobin-derived plasma dilution induced by the administration of Ringer's lactate solution was evaluated by nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Three hundred and twenty-three plasma dilution data points from 27 patients were used to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Ringer's lactate solution. A two-volume model best described the pharmacokinetics of Ringer's lactate solution.

This has led to a transition to telemedicine and directly impacts patient volume, evaluation and management practices. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of COVID-19 on patient characteristics in relation to outpatient attendance, ancillary testing, medical therapy, and surgical decision making. METHODS: A retrospective case series at an academic medical center was performed. Outpatient appointments from October 2019 (pre-COVID) and March 16CApril 10, 2020 (COVID) were analyzed. Prevalence rates and odds ratios were used to compare demographics, visit characteristics, ancillary tests, medication prescribing, and surgical decisions between telemedicine and in-person visits, before and during COVID. RESULTS: There was a decrease in scheduled visits during the COVID timeframe, for both in-person and telemedicine visits, with a comparable proportion of no-shows. There was a higher overall percentage of Hispanic/Latino patients who received care during the COVID timeframe (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.07C1.90) in both groups, although primary language was not significantly associated with attendance. There were fewer ancillary tests ordered (OR = 0.54) and more medications prescribed (OR = 1.59) during COVID telemedicine visits compared with pre-COVID in-person visits.

She was initially medically managed with antibiotics, anti-parasitics, anti-coagulants, and steroids. After experiencing breathlessness, chest discomfort, high systolic blood pressure, and tachycardia, she was admitted and diagnosed with post-COVID pneumonia, and was conservatively treated with steroids. She showed improvement, and was discharged upon being declared hemodynamically stable. While the patient was at home, she experienced periods of breathlessness and acral edema. This case raises the question of the correlation between hyponatremia and COVID-19, especially in regards to symptomatic presentations, including altered mental status, headache, and nausea.

This is a particularly vulnerable time for patients with pre-existing headache disorders. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache patients in China. METHODS: A survey was conducted through an online survey platform on June 6, 2020. Demographic characteristics, the PHQ-9, the ISI, a COVID-19 questionnaire and a headache profile survey were included in the online questionnaire. RESULTS: Eventually, a total of 15,000 participants from China completed the online questionnaire. Among them, 2806 participants had pre-existing headache disorders. Our analysis showed reductions in the duration of headaches (3.414  6.859 vs 4.033  7.325 h, P<0.001), number of headache days per month (1.788  2.989 vs 2.092  3.694, P<0.001), and headache intensity (4.110  1.609 vs 4.290  1.680, P<0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Smoking (OR = 1.397, 95% CI 1.090 to 1.790, P = 0.008) and getting support from family members during social isolation (OR = 1.656, 95% CI 1.075 to 2.550, P = 0.022) were independent factors affecting the reduction in the duration of headaches.

Methods: To determine the nutritional content of food hampers provided by our case study organization, we weighed all items of food hampers in three weighing rounds over a period of four months. The Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) was applied to measure households food insecurity. Results: Our results show that, at our case study food aid organization, food donations substantially contribute to energy, macro, and micronutrient dietary recommendation intake (DRI).

This study presents an economic model to evaluate cost effectiveness of coronary stents. METHODS Markov modeling was developed comparing total costs (Medicare payer perspective) between TAXUS Libert and TAXUS Express based on 3-year clinical outcomes from the TAXUS ATLAS Small Vessel and Long Lesion trials. RESULTS The TAXUS Libert 2.25-mm stent provided cost savings relative to TAXUS Express from a payer perspective ($17,605 vs. $20,281), driven by reduced target vessel revascularization (0.16 events/patient vs. 0.33 events/patient). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, TAXUS Libert was less costly with fewer major adverse cardiac events in over 99% of parameter sets. The TAXUS Libert Long (38 mm) stent was cost neutral relative to TAXUS Express from a payer perspective ($18,545 vs. $18,551) with fewer myocardial infarctions and cardiac deaths. Accounting for angiography-driven revascularizations, TAXUS Libert 2.25 mm still provided cost savings relative to TAXUS Express ($16,822 vs. $19,139), although TAXUS Libert Long was more expensive than TAXUS Express ($17,886 vs. $17,652). From a hospital perspective, TAXUS Libert Long provided cost savings up to a price premium of $671/stent, driven by fewer stents employed per patient. CONCLUSIONS This analysis confirms the utility of economic modeling in assessing new stent platforms. TAXUS Libert 2.25 mm is economically dominant relative to TAXUS Express when treating small vessels. TAXUS Libert Long is cost neutral to modestly more costly than TAXUS Express 2.25 mm from a payer perspective.","output":"Economic modeling of new stent platforms to evaluate cost effectiveness: analysis of the TAXUS Libert versus TAXUS express stents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On January 8, 2020, a novel coronavirus was officially announced as the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

HCFMUSP has been converted into a reference center for coronavirus disease 2019. The Division of Plastic Surgery postponed non-essential surgeries and outpatient consultations, accomplishing new guidelines (ANG) of national and international organizations. Even with these challenges arising from the pandemic, alternatives were considered to maintain institutional characteristics. This study aims to analyze this new scenario and the impact on patients' assistance and Plastic Surgery residents training. Methods: Total number of surgeries, type of procedures, and outpatient consultations in 2020, before (pre-ANG) and after (post-ANG) ANG, were compared with the same period in 2019 (2019-pre and 2020-post). Results: A marked reduction in the total number of surgeries and outpatient consultations was observed in the post-ANG period. In the post-ANG period, 267 operations were performed (26.7  20.3/week), while in the 2019-post period, 1036 surgeries were performed (103.6  9.7/week) (p = 0.0002).

We calculated weekly age- and sex-specific mortality rates for 93.1% of the Italian municipalities for the years 2015C2019 and for the first 26 weeks in 2020. We assumed the mortality experience during 2015C2019 as the reference period to calculate standardised mortality ratios. Furthermore, in order to compare the mortality experience of males and females, we calculated sex- and age- specific weekly direct standardised mortality rates and differences between the observed and expected number of deaths. We observed considerable changes in the demographics in the Italian population between the years 2015 and 2020, particularly among people 60 years and older and among males. The population is aging and the proportion of elderly males has increased, which was not reflected adequately in previous estimates of excess mortality.

Although the etiology is recognized as complex, most analyses have focused on social and biomedical determinants, with limited attention on psychological factors affecting care and nurturing in the home. We assessed whether the psychological distress of parents is related to child linear growth and stunting, and documented the associated risk factors, and examined the relationship between parental distress and behavioral and other risk factors for stunting. METHODS: We used data from the Indonesia National Health Survey 2013, including 46,315 children 6C59 months of age. Multivariate linear, logistic, and multilevel multinomial logistic regression, using survey weights, were used to assess the relationship between parental distress, as assessed by the WHO Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ20), with height-for-age z score (HAZ), stunting, and behavioral and other risk factors for stunting. RESULTS: Maternal, paternal and parental distress (i.e. both maternal and paternal distress) were associated with reduced linear growth of the children by 0.086 (95% CI -0.17, -0.00), 0.11 (95% CI -0.24, -0.02) and 0.19 (95% CI -0.37, -0.00) HAZ-scores, respectively. Maternal and paternal distress increased the risk of mild stunting (HAZ <-1) by 33% (95% CI 1.17,1.50) and 37% (95% CI 1.18,1.60), and the risk of moderate stunting (HAZ <-2) by 25% (95% CI 1.10,1.43) and 28% (95% CI 1.08,1.51]), respectively. Parental stress increased the risk of moderate stunting by 40% (95% CI 1.06,1.85). Amongst specific groups of risk factors, the proportion of HAZ-score lost was associated with socioeconomic factors (30.3%) including, low wealth, low maternal occupational status, low maternal education, rural residence, and low paternal occupational status; physiological factors (15.5%) including low maternal height, low maternal mid-upper arm circumference, being male, low paternal height; behavioral factors (8.9%) including open garbage disposal, paternal smoking, not using iodized salt; and experiencing at least one infectious diseases episode (1.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal, paternal and parental stress were associated with reduced linear growth of children. These findings highlight the complex etiology of stunting and suggest nutritional and other biomedical interventions are insufficient, and that promotion of mental and behavioral health programs for parents must be pursued as part of a comprehensive strategy to enhance child growth and development, i.e. improved caretaker capacity, integrated community development, improved parenting skills, as well as reduced gender discrimination, and domestic violence.","output":"The psychological distress of parents is associated with reduced linear growth of children: Evidence from a nationwide population survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nanocomposites formed by graphene oxide (GO) and carbazate-modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-N) were developed to investigate their multiple properties for wide applications.

The incidence of EONS in the UK is 0.7C1.0/1000 live births, but many more babies are screened and treated with intravenous antibiotics based upon antenatal risk factors. These babies can remain in hospital for antibiotic treatment lasting five days or more due to raised serum inflammatory markers. The majority of these babies remain clinically well. The Covid-19 pandemic has unfortunately resulted in the forced distancing and separation of families at such a crucial time for bonding. A Hospital at Home service could provide a safe and effective means of delivering antibiotic treatment in the community setting thereby reducing inpatient stay and reuniting families together sooner.ObjectivesWe present a prospective service evaluation of a newly established Hospital at Home service for newborn babies undergoing treatment for EONS in the postnatal department of a large tertiary teaching hospital. We evaluate the demographics of the babies referred to the service including treatment parameters, the number of inpatient treatment days saved and qualitative measures of parental experiences.MethodsProspective data analysis of all babies born between 25th April and 31st July 2020 with confirmed or suspected EONS who were referred to the Hospital at Home service. Data collected included demographic information such as gestation and birth weight, C-reactive protein measurements, blood and cerebrospinal fluid culture results, timing of discharge and the total number of intravenous antibiotic doses given at home. A post-treatment questionnaire was undertaken to assess parental feedback.ResultsIn total, 41 neonatal patients were referred to the Hospital at Home service over the study period. On average, babies received four doses of intravenous cefotaxime at home, resulting in a reduction of two inpatient treatment days per patient, and 85 inpatient treatment days across the study period. One patient required a trip to hospital for repeat cannulation. No patients required re-admission to hospital during the study period. A post-treatment questionnaire was universally positive with parents evaluating the service as efficient, professional and so much easier being comfortable at home. There were no negative comments.ConclusionsA neonatal Hospital at Home service is effective in reducing the length of inpatient stay for babies undergoing treatment of EONS. With an average reduction of two inpatient days per patient, the service not only provides an improved maternal and family experience, but also reduces the inpatient workload on postnatal wards and is a significant cost-saving initiative. More research is required to formalise the referral criteria and assess whether additional neonatal services such as phototherapy could also be provided in the home setting.","output":"Hospital at home antibiotic treatment for early onset neonatal sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To describe patient characteristics, clinical manifestations, disease course including viral replication patterns, and outcomes of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory infection from the Middle East respiratory syndrome and to compare these features with patients with severe acute respiratory infection due to other etiologies.

PATIENTS Critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection (n = 330) admitted between September 2012 and October 2015 were compared to consecutive critically ill patients with community-acquired severe acute respiratory infection of non-Middle East respiratory syndrome etiology (non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection) (n = 222). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Although Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection patients were younger than those with non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection (median [quartile 1, quartile 3] 58 yr [44, 69] vs 70 [52, 78]; p < 0.001), clinical presentations and comorbidities overlapped substantially. Patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection had more severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/FIO2: 106 [66, 160] vs 176 [104, 252]; p < 0.001) and more frequent nonrespiratory organ failure (nonrespiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score: 6 [4, 9] vs 5 [3, 7]; p = 0.002), thus required more frequently invasive mechanical ventilation (85.2% vs 73.0%; p < 0.001), oxygen rescue therapies (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 5.8% vs 0.9%; p = 0.003), vasopressor support (79.4% vs 55.0%; p < 0.001), and renal replacement therapy (48.8% vs 22.1%; p < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS Substantial overlap exists in the clinical presentation and comorbidities among patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection from other etiologies; therefore, a high index of suspicion combined with diagnostic testing is essential component of severe acute respiratory infection investigation for at-risk patients. The lack of distinguishing clinical features, the need to rely on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from respiratory samples, variability in viral shedding duration, lack of effective therapy, and high mortality represent substantial clinical challenges and help guide ongoing clinical research efforts.","output":"Critically Ill Patients With the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Azithromycin (AZ) is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a large volume of distribution.

Negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) are one of the critical resources for control of infectious respiratory diseases, such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. However, there is insufficient attention to efficient allocation of NPIR-equipped hospitals. Methods: We aim to explore any insufficiency and spatial disparity of NPIRs in South Korea in response to infectious disease outbreaks based on a simple analytic approach. We examined the history of installing NPIRs in South Korea between the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) in 2015 to evaluate the allocation process and spatial distribution of NPIRs across the country. Then, for two types of infectious diseases (a highly contagious disease like COVID-19 vs. a hospital-based transmission like MERS-Cov), we estimated the level of disparity between NPIR capacity and demand at the sub-regional level in South Korea by applying the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. Results: Geospatial information system (GIS) mapping reveals a substantial shortage and misallocation of NPIRs, indicating that the Korean government should consider a simple but evidence-based spatial method to identify the areas that need NPIRs most and allocate funds wisely. The 2SFCA method suggests that, despite the recent addition of NPIRs across the country, there should still be more NPIRs regardless of the spread pattern of the disease. It also illustrates high levels of regional disparity in allocation of those facilities in preparation for an infectious disease, due to the lack of evidence-based approach. Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of evidence-based decision-making processes in allocating public health facilities, as misallocation of facilities could impede the responsiveness of the public health system during an epidemic. This study provides some evidence to be used to allocate the resources for NPIRs, the urgency of which is heightened in the face of rapidly evolving threats from the novel COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"The Spatial Allocation of Hospitals With Negative Pressure Isolation Rooms in Korea: Are We Prepared for New Outbreaks?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To prevent further spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Japanese government announced a state of emergency, resulting in major stress for the population.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has made visible efforts oriented to support online learning. In such a context, Open Educational Resources (OER) provide a greater opportunity for all people to access digital materials for teaching and learning, without regarding their geographical locations or economic limitations. However, there are some concerns about OER search and visibility. Indeed, OER search experience for non-expert users demands time and effort to find educational content that matches their specific requirements for subject context, educational level, format, pedagogical approach, associated license, among other characteristics. To address this problem, structured metadata can be embedded in web pages using annotations in an encoding format and supporting vocabulary. Schema.org introduced a standardized vocabulary for providing a large range of terms for describing any web content. The most important search engines have adopted these vocabulary terms to enrich the search results. Nevertheless, using the vocabulary to ensure OER web pages visibility requires knowledge about the vocabulary and the JSON-LD format. To overcome this barrier, we developed a web application whose functionality allows OER producers to generate the JSON-LD structure that should be inserted in the head of the educational web page.

Grade point average (GPA) was introduced to qualitatively appraise the plan quality into A, B and C (within 3%, 3-10% and > 10% difference of clinical plan score, corresponding to 4, 3, 2 point respectively). 5 trainees with minimum planning experience completed the teaching course. RESULTS Trainees achieved an average of 65.1% of total points (3.6 GPA) with 84 minutes planning time for the benchmark case pre-teaching, and improved to an average of 75.7% (4.2 GPA) using 48 minutes post-teaching. The clinical plan scored 72.7% of total points. All trainees improved their teaching plans' scores after taking the virtual tutoring program. Post-teaching, all trainees received the GPA of A (clinical quality level) on the benchmark case planning. The total teaching time for each trainee ranged between 5 and 7 hours.

The vital parameters, and sex were overlapping. patients during the pandemic were younger (38 vs 46) The priority codes for the medical examination were not different. CoViD pandemic patients have higher codes (yellow and red) for the medical examination (66% vs 59%);discharge severity codes (red) more frequently than in the reference period (2.4% vs 0.9%) and more frequently need hospitalization (26.8% vs 16.8%).ConclusionsThe epidemic has led to a reduction of accesses for intossication and substance abuse. Patients had more frequent hospitalization needs and more severe exit codes. the data may be due to the fact that during the pandemic only the most serious patients access the E.D., but also to the fact that a pandemic has contributed to destabilizing this class of fragile patients.","output":"Ed accesses severity for intossication and substance abuse during the first pandemic wave of 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). experience of a lombardy ed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within a span of 11 months starting from December 2019, around 47.6 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including the number of deaths touching 1,215,601 on November 3, 2020.

In an anonymous online survey, we examined willingness to hire candidates who smoke cigarettes or are overweight for different job types and tested respondents' smoking history and body weight as moderating factors. METHOD Employed U.S. adults (N = 1,107) were recruited online in 2019-2020. Respondents indicated their willingness to hire and hiring preferences for six different job roles in reference to eight different attributes, which included smoking and overweight status. Analyses tested differences by job type and respondents' own smoking and overweight status. RESULTS Percent willing to hire candidates who smoke (are overweight) was 7.6% (40.3%) for health aide, 15.3% (66.2%) for receptionist, and 53.6% (58.1%) for groundskeeper. Ever-smoker respondents were more likely than never-smokers to be willing to hire candidates who smoke (odds ratios [OR] = 1.98-3.00) and less likely to identify smoking as a least preferred attribute (ps < .009). Overweight respondents were more likely than nonoverweight respondents to be willing to hire overweight candidates (OR = 1.47-1.99) and less likely to identify overweight as a least preferred attribute (ps < .002).

We show that co-expression of NDPK-A during transient expression results in improved transfection efficiency in CHO cells, presumably due to enhanced transportation of plasmid DNA into the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex. Furthermore, introduction of the Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBNA-1), a protein that is capable of inducing extrachromosomal maintenance, when coupled with complementary oriP elements on a transient plasmid, was utilised to reduce the effect of plasmid dilution. Whilst there was attenuated growth upon introduction of the EBNA-1 system into CHO cells, when both NDPK-A nuclear import and EBNA-1 mediated technologies were employed together this resulted in enhanced transient recombinant protein yields superior to those generated using either approach independently, including when expressing the complex SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein.","output":"Engineering of Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells With NDPK-A to Enhance DNA Nuclear Delivery Combined With EBNA1 Plasmid Maintenance Gives Improved Exogenous Transient Reporter, mAb and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the last decade, running has become one of the most popular physical activities in the world.

The molecular mechanisms regulating the fate of the initial immune response to infection, either as a protective response or as detrimental immunopathology, are not well understood. The purinergic receptor P2X7 is an ionotropic nucleotide-gated ion channel receptor expressed on immune cells that has been implicated in induction and maintenance of excessive inflammation. Here, we analyze the role of this receptor in a mouse model of influenza virus infection using a receptor knockout (KO) mouse strain. Our results demonstrate that the absence of the P2X7 receptor results in a better outcome to influenza virus infection characterized by reduced weight loss and increased survival upon experimental influenza challenge compared to wild-type mice. This effect was not virus strain specific. Overall lung pathology and apoptosis were reduced in virus-infected KO mice. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), gamma interferon (IFN-), and CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) was also reduced in the lungs of the infected KO mice. Infiltration of neutrophils and depletion of CD11b(+) macrophages, characteristic of severe influenza virus infection in mice, were lower in the KO animals.

The adaptive immune response that coincides with this onset of protection could represent the necessary elements of immunity against COVID-19. METHODS: Serological and T cell analysis was performed in a cohort of 20 healthcare workers after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. The primary endpoint was the adaptive immune responses detectable at days 7 and 10 after dosing. FINDINGS: Spike-specific T cells and binding antibodies were detectable 10 days after the first dose of the vaccine, in contrast to receptor-blocking and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibodies, which were mostly undetectable at this early time point.

The inclusion of mechanistic detail in models of highly complex systems has the potential to increase realism, but it also increases the number of modelling assumptions, which become harder to check as their possible interactions multiply. In a major study of the Covid-19 epidemic in England, Knock et al. (2020) fit an age structured SEIR model with added health service compartments to data on deaths, hospitalization and test results from Covid-19 in seven English regions for the period March to December 2020. The simplest version of the model has 684 states per region. One main conclusion is that only full lockdowns brought the pathogen reproduction number, R, below one, with R ? 1 in all regions on the eve of March 2020 lockdown. We critically evaluate the Knock et al. epidemiological model, and the semi-causal conclusions made using it, based on an independent reimplementation of the model designed to allow relaxation of some of its strong assumptions. In particular, Knock et al. model the effect on transmission of both non-pharmaceutical interventions and other effects, such as weather, using a piecewise linear function, b(t), with 12 breakpoints at selected government announcement or intervention dates. We replace this representation by a smoothing spline with time varying smoothness, thereby allowing the form of b(t) to be substantially more data driven, and we check that the corresponding smoothness assumption is not driving our results. We also reset the mean incubation time and time from first symptoms to hospitalisation, used in the model, to values implied by the papers cited by Knock et al. as the source of these quantities. We conclude that there is no sound basis for using the Knock et al. model and their analysis to make counterfactual statements about the number of deaths that would have occurred with different lockdown timings. However, if fits of this epidemiological model structure are viewed as a reasonable basis for inference about the time course of incidence and R, then without very strong modelling assumptions, the pathogen reproduction number was probably below one, and incidence in substantial decline, some days before either of the first two English national lockdowns. This result coincides with that obtained by more direct attempts to reconstruct incidence. Of course it does not imply that lockdowns had no effect, but it does suggest that other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) may have been much more effective than Knock et al. imply, and that full lockdowns were probably not the cause of R dropping below one.","output":"Was R < 1 before the English lockdowns?

This study compares three alternative kitchen waste collection and transportation systems for a virtual modern urban area with 300,000 residents and a population density of 10,000 persons per square kilometre. Door-to-door collection, being the standard practice in modern urban centres, remains the most economically advantageous at a cost of 263 euros per tonne of kitchen waste. Important drawbacks are the difficult logistics, increased city traffic, air and noise pollution. The quieter, cleaner and more hygienic vacuum transport of kitchen waste comes with a higher cost of 367 euros per tonne, mainly resulting from a higher initial investment cost for the system installation. The third option includes the well-known use of under-sink food waste disposers (often called garbage grinders) that are connected to the kitchen's wastewater piping system, with a total yearly cost of 392 euros per tonne. Important advantages with this system are the clean operation and the current availability of a city-wide sewage conveyance pipeline system.

Liriope platyphylla (LP) extract is known to improve respiratory function. LP extract ameliorates the symptoms commonly seen in bronchitis, asthma, and COPD and enhances immunity, as it has anti-inflammatory properties. In a previous study in rats, LP effectively improved respiratory inflammation levels. However, few randomized controlled trials have verified the effects of LP in respiratory disease and there have been no studies to determine the appropriate dose and duration to make it a more convenient functional health product. Based on previous studies, we would like to proceed with this clinical trial under the assumption that LP will help improve respiratory function and produce anti-inflammatory effects. METHODS: This will be a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Participants will randomly be allocated to receive either 1000 mg LP or placebo. The total duration of the clinical trial will be 4 to 6 weeks. A follow-up assessment will be conducted 4 weeks after screening, and the effect and safety of LP application will be assessed at this second visit. The primary outcome will be the breathlessness, cough, and sputum scale score. Secondary outcomes will include pulmonary function, clinical symptoms of cough and sputum (reported through a questionnaire), changes in immune cells, changes in immune factors used to analyze allergic inflammation in bronchi, antioxidant enzyme activity, nitric oxide level, and COPD assessment test score. DISCUSSION: This study has limited inclusion and exclusion criteria and the intervention will be well-controlled. This will be the first randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of LP extract in adults with cough and sputum. This study will provide insight into the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects and improvement of respiratory function of LP.","output":"Efficacy of liriope platyphylla extract for improving respiratory functions: Study protocol for a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The New Zealand White rabbit (NZWR) is the first small-animal experimental model of intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) for retinoblastoma treatment. The NZWR has dual ophthalmic arteries (OA): the external OA (EOA) arises from the external carotid artery and the internal OA (IOA) from the internal carotid artery. We describe the technique that we have refined for OA catheterization in rabbits, and describe the angioanatomical variations in the OA supply to the NZWR eye and implications for IAC delivery, which were identified as part of a larger project exploring IAC effects in a rabbit retinoblastoma model. METHODS We developed techniques to perform angiography of the external and internal carotid arteries and superselective angiography of the EOA and IOA in NZWR using transfemoral access and a microwire/microcatheter system. EOA and IOA supply to the eye was determined angiographically and recorded before selective OA catheterization and angiography. RESULTS 114 rabbits underwent carotid angiographic evaluation and OA catheterization (161 total eyes evaluated, 112 right, 49 left). Most eyes had a single dominant arterial supply; either IOA or EOA. EOA was dominant in 73% (118/161), and IOA was dominant in 17% (27/161). Co-dominant supply was seen in 10% (16/161). Of the rabbits with bilateral OA catheterization, 25/47 (53%) had bilateral dominant EOA. CONCLUSION Successful catheterization of the OA in the NZWR can be readily accomplished with nuanced technique. The external OA is the dominant arterial supply in the majority of NZWR eyes. These findings allow for successful reproduction of OA catheterization studies of IAC for retinoblastoma in NZWR.","output":"Angiographic investigation of orbital vascular variations in the rabbit and implications for endovascular intra-arterial chemotherapy models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Millions of people are mourning the death of a loved to COVID-19. According to previous studies, the circumstances of coronavirus disease-related deaths may lead to dysfunctional grief. The purpose of this study was to introduce the Polish adaptation of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) as well as to assess the relationship between dysfunctional grief due to a COVID-19 death, resilience and perceived social support. The adaptation was carried out on a general population sample of 286 individuals aged 18-54 years, with the evaluation being performed on a group comprising 214 people aged 18-78 years, who lost a loved one during the pandemic. The Polish version of PGS revealed a single-factor structure with strong internal consistency (&#945; = 0.89). The PGS scores were associated with measures of complicated grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression (Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale) and lower resilience (Resilience Scale 14), which confirmed the scale's convergent validity. No relation between PGS scores and health behaviors (Inventory of Health Behaviors) was observed, which confirmed the scale's discriminant validity. The results of the bootstrapping technique revealed that resilience mediates the relationship between perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) and dysfunctional grief (total mediation). The results of this study suggest the need for practitioners to focus on resilience-enhancing interventions and perceived social support in order to improve mental health in people who lost their loved ones during the new coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Pandemic grief in Poland: adaptation of a measure and its relationship with social support and resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Big-data epidemic models are being increasingly used to influence government policy to help with control and eradication of infectious diseases. In the case of livestock, detailed movement records have been used to parametrize realistic transmission models. While livestock movement data are readily available in the UK and other countries in the EU, in many countries around the world, such detailed data are not available. By using a comprehensive database of the UK cattle trade network, we implement various sampling strategies to determine the quantity of network data required to give accurate epidemiological predictions. It is found that by targeting nodes with the highest number of movements, accurate predictions on the size and spatial spread of epidemics can be made.

Here we show that efforts to predict disease emergence commonly conflate fundamentally different evolutionary and epidemiological time scales, and are likely to fail because of the enormous number of unsampled viruses that could conceivably emerge in humans. Although we know much about the patterns and processes of virus evolution on evolutionary time scales as depicted in family-scale phylogenetic trees, these data have little predictive power to reveal the short-term microevolutionary processes that underpin cross-species transmission and emergence. Truly understanding disease emergence therefore requires a new mechanistic and integrated view of the factors that allow or prevent viruses spreading in novel hosts. We present such a view, suggesting that both ecological and genetic aspects of virus emergence can be placed within a simple population genetic framework, which in turn highlights the importance of host population size and density in determining whether emergence will be successful. Despite this framework, we conclude that a more practical solution to preventing and containing the successful emergence of new diseases entails ongoing virological surveillance at the humanCanimal interface and regions of ecological disturbance.","output":"Predicting virus emergence amid evolutionary noise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has impacted the context in which healthcare staff and teams operate and this has implications for quality improvement (QI) work. Contrary to the usual ambivalent relationship staff have with QI work, there have been examples of unprecedented staff engagement in implementing rapid changes during the pandemic indicating a change in important underlying factors that impact staff involvement in QI. The purpose of this study is to explore staff perspectives about how experience and skills of QI methods supported them in implementing innovative practices during COVID-19. METHODS: This is a qualitative narrative study based on narrative interviews to collect healthcare staff stories of implementing rapid change. The stories were identified through social media (Twitter) and a national health magazine issued by the Irish health service. Twenty staff members participated in the interviews. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and anonymised. A four-step thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The analysis revealed the transformational journey of healthcare staff from the initial shock and anxiety caused by COVID-19 to making sense of the situation, implementing rapid changes, and acknowledging COVID as a learning experience. Six themes were evident from the analysis: COVID anxiety and fear, emotional supports and coping mechanisms, person-centric changes, COVID as a forcing function for change, a collective way of working and looking back and thinking ahead. CONCLUSIONS: While most rapid changes during COVID-19 did not represent a systematic and explicit QI application, QI principles were evident throughout the stories and actions taken, including making small changes, testing changes, learning, reflecting as a team, and improving. Many staff members were able to retrospectively identify the relevance of QI principles. COVID-19 eliminated some traditional barriers to change leading to efficient solutions, thus highlighting a need to sustain these positive changes into routine practice to develop an adaptive healthcare system receptive to QI.

Rwanda has one of the highest under five stunting rates globally, and malnutrition remains one of the most pressing public health issues; therefore, factors that shape food and nutrition security are of utmost concern. Globally, the variety of foods available in open-air markets has been shown to affect dietary diversity. Furthermore, the consumption of indigenous foods can contribute to a diverse diet and improve nutrition status. At present, there are limited data on foods available for purchase in open-air markets in Africa. Therefore, this study was designed to provide data on food availability in the largest open-air markets of Rwandas most populated city, Kigali, and to highlight which foods indigenous to Africa can be purchased. METHODS: All consumables were inventoried between October and December of 2020 in three open-air markets of Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. Consumables were organized by the site of domestication and the nutritional contents of some African indigenous crops were compared to similar non-indigenous items. RESULTS: A variety of raw and processed consumables was available in the open-air markets inventoried; however, only 25.8% of available species are indigenous to Africa. All Rwandas staples, including sweet potatoes, plantains, beans, maize, banana, and cassava, are endemic to other continents. Indigenous plant species, which are often drought-resistant and more nutritious, for example, Africas pineapple fruits (Myrianthus holstii), could not be purchased in Kigalis open-air markets. Pineapple fruits are richer in iron, vitamin C, protein, and vitamin A than banana, which is the most consumed fruit in Rwanda. CONCLUSIONS: Given rapid population growth, limited arable land, and erratic climate patterns, policies to conserve and promote indigenous species, especially those already adapted to harsh environmental conditions, should be enacted in Rwanda. The cultivation of native vegetables and fruits in home gardens, and the conservation of edible wild species, can improve dietary diversity and enhance food and nutrition security across the entire country.","output":"What Kigalis open-air markets reveal about achieving food and nutrition security: the role of African indigenous crops"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged leaders to alter the way they manage their organization's employees, such as requiring them to quarantine, self-isolate or practice social distancing so that they comply with government health directives.

In this paper, we formulate a model with both epidemiological and economic content to assist this decision-making process. We consider two ways to handle the balance between economic costs and deaths. First, we use the statistical value of life, which in Canada is about C$7 million, to optimize over a single variable, which is the sum of the economic cost and the value of lives lost. Our second method is to calculate the Pareto optimal front when we look at the two variablesdeaths and economic costs. In both cases we find that, for most parameter values, the optimal policy is to adopt an initial shutdown level which reduces the reproduction number of the epidemic to close to 1. This level is then reduced once a vaccination programme is underway. Our model also indicates that an oscillating policy of strict and mild shutdowns is less effective than a policy which maintains a moderate shutdown level.","output":"Optimal shutdown strategies for COVID-19 with economic and mortality costs: British Columbia as a case study"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(D,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/25.md","filePath":"consultation/25.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/25.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
