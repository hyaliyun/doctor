MATERIALS AND METHODS From September 2009 to September 2013, seven patients, diagnosed with unilateral adrenal APA and underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous RFA, were recruited in this retrospective study. Eighteen unilateral adrenal APA with the same tumor size (<25 mm) who underwent LA during the same interval were enrolled as control group. Treatment success was defined as complete tumor ablation on follow-up CT scan and normalization of serum aldosterone-to-renin ratio. We also compared \\"normalization ability\\" between RFA group and LA group. Normalization ability was defined as reduction in blood pressure, decrease in number of antihypertensive medicine use, reduction in serum aldosterone, and increase in serum potassium level. RESULTS There was no statistically significant demographic difference in both groups. The mean tumor size was 18 (8-25) mm in RFA and 19 (11-25) mm in LA groups, respectively. There was only one intra-procedure hypertensive crisis in the RFA group. No other complications needed further management in both groups. During an interval of 3-6 months of follow-up, the treatment success rate reached 100 % in the RFA group versus 94.4 % in the LA group. Normalization ability was statistically equivalent in the RFA and the LA group. Comparing with LA group, RFA group demonstrated with less post-operative pain (visual analog scale, 2.0  1.16 vs. 4.22  1.44, p < 0.001) and shorter operative time (105  34 vs. 194  58 min, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS CT-guided percutaneous RFA is effective, safe and is a justifiable alternative for patients who are reluctant or unfit for laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of APA.","output":"Comparison of radiofrequency ablation versus laparoscopic adrenalectomy for benign aldosterone-producing adenoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Performers acutely need but lack tools to remotely rehearse and create live theatre, particularly due to global restrictions on social interactions during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Methods: Eslicarbazepine acetate suspension (40 mg/mL) was prepared using Aptiom tablets after optimizing the tablet crushing methods and the vehicle composition. A stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to monitor the eslicarbazepine stability in the prepared suspension. Three enteric feeding tubes of various composition and dimensions were evaluated for the delivery of the suspensions. The suspension was evaluated for the physical and chemical stability for 48 hours. Results: The reproducibility and consistency of particle size reduction was found to be best with standard mortar/pestle. The viscosity analysis and physical stability studies showed that ORA-Plus:water (50:50 v/v) was optimal for suspending ability and flowability of suspension through the tubes. The developed HPLC method was found to be stability indicating and suitable for the assay of eslicarbazepine acetate in the prepared suspension. The eslicarbazepine concentrations in separately prepared suspensions were within acceptable range (3%), indicating accuracy and reproducibility of the procedure. The eslicarbazepine concentrations in suspensions before and after delivery through the enteric feeding tubes were within acceptable range (4%), indicating absence of any physical/chemical interactions of eslicarbazepine with the tubes and a successful delivery of eslicarbazepine dosage via enteric feeding tubes. The stability study results showed that eslicarbazepine concentration in the suspension remained unchanged when stored at room temperature for 48 hours.

The advantages and disadvantages of hand-sewn, linear-stapled, or circular-stapled anastomoses have been subject to debate in recent years. We explored a new method of end-to-side anastomosis using a circular stapler that embeds the anastomosis and the remaining esophageal tissue into the gastric cavity to reduce the occurrence of anastomotic leakage and to prevent gastroesophageal reflux. METHODS In 127 patients with esophageal carcinomas, end-to-side anastomoses with esophageal embedding were performed by connecting the anvil and body of the circular stapler inside the stomach before firing and embedding the anastomosis and remaining esophagus into the stomach after esophagectomy. Retrospective investigations on postoperative complications such as leakage, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux were conducted. RESULTS A total of 123 patients (96.9%) had successful surgery, and 4 patients (3.3%) developed anastomotic leakage, with the total morbidity of 20 of 123 (16.3%) and in-hospital mortality of 1 of 123 (0.8%). The incidence of stricture (<1 cm) affected 14 of 123 patients (11.4%). Eight patients underwent dilatation treatment as a result of severe dysphagia (6.5%). Half of the patients [62 of 123 (50.4%)] experienced postoperative heartburn, 11 of 123 patients (8.9%) experienced acid regurgitation, and 16 of 123 patients (13.0%) experienced nocturnal cough. CONCLUSIONS Embedded cervical esophagogastrostomy with circular stapler is a simple and convenient method, with low incidence of anastomotic leakage and a good antireflux effect.","output":"Embedded cervical esophagogastrostomy: a simple and convenient method using a circular stapler after esophagectomy for esophageal carcinomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, nsP3 (non-structural Protein3) is the largest multi-domain protein Its role is multifaceted and important for the viral life cycle Nonetheless, regarding the specific role of each domain there are many aspects of their function that have to be investigated SARS Unique Domains (SUDs), constitute the nsP3c region of the nsP3, and were observed for the first time in SARS-CoV Two of them, namely SUD-N (the first SUD) and the SUD-M (sequential to SUD-N), exhibit structural homology with nsP3b (\\"X\\" or macro domain);indeed all of them are folded in a three-layer alpha/beta/alpha sandwich On the contrary, they do not exhibit functional similarities, like ADP-ribose binding properties and ADP-ribose hydrolase activity There are reports that suggest that these two SUDs may exhibit a binding selectivity towards G-oligonucleotides, a feature which may contribute to the characterization of their role in the formation of the replication/transcription viral complex (RTC) and of the interaction of various viral \\"components\\" with the host cell While the structures of these domains of SARS-CoV-2 have not been determined yet, SUDs interaction with oligonucleotides and/or RNA molecules may provide a platform for drug discovery Here, we report the almost complete NMR backbone and side-chain resonance assignment (1H,13C,15N) of SARS-CoV-2 SUD-N protein, and the NMR chemical shift-based prediction of the secondary structure elements These data may be exploited for its 3D structure determination and the screening of chemical compounds libraries, which may alter SUD-N function","output":"1H,13C and 15N chemical shift assignments of the SUD domains of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3c: \\"the N-terminal domain-SUD-N\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El leucismo consiste en la prdida completa de un pigmento en particular o de todos los pigmentos, excepto aquellos de partes blandas.

In contrast, there is a dearth of studies among the populations of Arabian Gulf countries including Oman. This study has two interrelated aims: (i) to explore the prevalence of SAD among Omani adults, and (ii) to tease out the links between socio-demographic factors and SAD in Oman. METHODS: A cross-sectional study via an online survey was conducted among 1019 adult Omani nationals residing in Oman. The presence of SAD was assessed using the Arabic version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). RESULTS: Nearly half the participants (45.9%, n = 468) exhibited caseness for SAD as defined by LSAS. In the multivariate logistic analysis, participants below 40 years of age were 1.6 times (OR = 1.568, p = .026) more likely to have caseness for SAD than those who were 40 and older. Women were 1.3 times (OR = 1.348, p = .038) more likely to exhibit caseness for SAD than men. Participants who had secondary or undergraduate education were respectively 1.5 times (OR = 1.45, p = .014) and 2.5 times (OR = 2.509, p < .001) to have caseness for SAD than those who were graduates. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that 45.9% of the participants reached the cut-off for caseness in LSAS, which is high compared to reports from other populations.

Badges with the title \\"DOCTOR\\" was distributed to 83 Emergency Medicine (EM) residents and 28 EM Attendings in the department. After 3 months, the residents and Attendings were surveyed to assess the efficacy of the intervention. Descriptive data, univariable, and multivariable analyses were conducted. RESULTS There were 98 respondents to the pre-intervention survey and 87 respondents to the post-intervention survey. 91% of EM physicians reported that they were misidentified by the patients and their families. Compared to male EM physicians, female EM physicians were disproportionately more likely to be misidentified as a non-physician 43% vs 97%, respectfully, 95% CI: [37,66], p < 0.0001. After wearing the \\"DOCTOR\\" badges, a postintervention survey showed decrease in misidentification of female EM physicians by patients and their families to 81.6%, a 15.4% decrease, p = 0.03.

We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of polymicrobial VAP in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: All neonates with definite diagnosis of VAP from a tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Taiwan between October 2017 and September 2020 were prospectively observed and enrolled for analyses. All clinical features, therapeutic interventions and outcomes were compared between the polymicrobial VAP and monomicrobial VAP episodes. Multivariate regression analyses were used to find the independent risk factors for treatment failure. RESULTS: Among 236 episodes of neonatal VAP, 60 (25.4%) were caused by more than one microorganisms. Polymicrobial VAP episodes were more likely to be associated with multidrug-resistant pathogens (53.3% versus 34.7%, P = 0.014), more often occurred in later days of life and in neonates with prolonged intubation and underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Otherwise most clinical characteristics of polymicrobial VAP were similar to those of monomicrobial VAP. The therapeutic responses and treatment outcomes were also comparable between these two groups, although modification of therapeutic antibiotics were significantly more common in polymicrobial VAP episodes than monomicrobial VAP episodes (63.3% versus 46.2%; P < 0.001). None of any specific pathogens was significantly associated with worse outcomes. Instead, it is the severity of illness, including presence of concurrent bacteremia, septic shock, and requirement of high-frequency oscillatory ventilator and underlying neurological sequelae that are independently associated with treatment failure.

Specific and affordable treatments are needed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence regarding the use of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients is still limited. We compared the safety and efficacy of COVID-19-convalescent plasma administration as a complement to standard treatment in the early management of patients with moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS We carried out a random double blinded, placebo-controlled trial that compared standard treatment plus convalescent plasma (CP) or plus non-convalescent plasma in the management of COVID-19 patients. The main outcome was survival and secondary endpoints included: length of hospitalisation (LOH), days from treatment to discharge, time to clinical improvement or death within a 28-day period, and adverse reactions to treatment. RESULTS Administration of CP with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 did not affect patient survival, RR = 1.003, 95% CI (0.3938, 2.555). These results led to terminate the RCT prematurely. However, early treatment of COVID-19 patients with CP tended to decrease the LOH while the delay in CP treatment was associated with longer hospitalisation. In addition, delay in CP treatment negatively affected the recovery of the respiratory rate. CONCLUSION Use of CP for the treatment of COVID-19 patients is safe and its early use can decrease the LOH and improve respiratory function.

Endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage can potentially reduce this and, therefore, the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. New evidence on subglottic secretion drainage as a preventive measure for ventilator-associated pneumonia has been recently published and to consider the evidence in totality, we conducted an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. DESIGN We searched computerized databases, reference lists, and personal files. We included randomized clinical trials of mechanically ventilated patients comparing standard endotracheal tubes to those with subglottic secretion drainage and reporting on the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Studies were meta-analyzed for the primary outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia and secondary clinical outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We identified 13 randomized clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria with a total of 2442 randomized patients. Of the 13 studies, 12 reported a reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia rates in the subglottic secretion drainage arm; in meta-analysis, the overall risk ratio for ventilator-associated pneumonia was 0.55 (95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.66; p < .00001) with no heterogeneity (I = 0%). The use of subglottic secretion drainage was associated with reduced intensive care unit length of stay (-1.52 days; 95% confidence interval, -2.94 to -0.11; p = .03); decreased duration of mechanically ventilated (-1.08 days; 95% confidence interval, -2.04 to -0.12; p = .03), and increased time to first episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia (2.66 days; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-4.26; p = .001). There was no effect on adverse events or on hospital or intensive care unit mortality. CONCLUSIONS In those at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, the use of endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage is effective for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia and may be associated with reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay.","output":"Subglottic secretion drainage for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop nonlinear approximations to critical and relaxation phenomena, complemented by the optimization procedures In the first part, we discuss general methods for calculation of critical indices and amplitudes from the perturbative expansions Several important examples of the Stokes flow through 2D channels are brought up Power series for the permeability derived for small values of amplitude are employed for calculation of various critical exponents in the regime of large amplitudes Special nonlinear approximations valid for arbitrary values of the wave amplitude are derived from the expansions In the second part, the technique developed for critical phenomena is applied to relaxation phenomena The concept of time-translation invariance is discussed, and its spontaneous violation and restoration considered Emerging probabilistic patterns correspond to a local breakdown of time-translation invariance Their evolution leads to the time-translation invariance complete (or partial) restoration We estimate the typical time extent, amplitude and direction for such a restorative process The new technique is based on explicit introduction of origin in time as an optimization parameter After some transformations, we arrive at the exponential and generalized exponential-type solutions (Gompertz approximants), with explicit finite time scale, which is only implicit in the initial parameterization with polynomial approximation The concept of crash as a fast relaxation phenomenon, consisting of time-translation invariance breaking and restoration, is advanced Several COVID-related crashes in the time series for Shanghai Composite and Dow Jones Industrial are discussed as an illustration ? 2020 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Nonlinear approximations to critical and relaxation processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study proposes a green and easy route for synthesizing clay/silver nanocomposite on denim fabric which can instantaneously discolor the garment and produce antibacterial effects during a one-step process with minimal toxicity to humans.

Asian ethnicity (3.73 (1.28-10.91), palliative treatment (5.74 (1.15-28.79), initial diagnosis of cancer >24m before (2.14 (1.04-4.44), dyspnoea (4.94 (1.99-12.25), and increased CRP levels (10.35 (1.05-52.21)) were positively associated with COVID-19 death. An inverse association was observed with increased levels of albumin (0.04 (0.01-0.04). Conclusions: A longer-established diagnosis of cancer was associated with increasing severity of infection as well as COVID-19 death, possibly reflecting effects of more advanced malignant disease impact on this infection. Asian ethnicity and palliative treatment were also associated with COVID-19 death in cancer patients.","output":"Factors affecting COVID-19 outcomes in cancer patients - A first report from Guys Cancer Centre in London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants represents a serious threat worldwide, thus rapid and cost-effective methods are required for their identification. Since November 2020, the TaqPath COVID-19 assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) has been used to identify viral strains of the new lineage B.1.1.7, since it fails to detect the S-gene with the &#8710;69/70 deletion. Here, we proposed S-gene mutations screening with the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 assay (Seegene), another widely used RT-PCR test that targets Sarbecovirus E, SARS-CoV-2 N, and RdRp/S genes. Accordingly, we evaluated the S gene amplification curve pattern compared to those of the other genes. Exploiting an Allplex assay-generated dataset, we screened 663 RT-PCR digital records, including all SARS-CoV-2 respiratory samples tested in our laboratory with the Allplex assay between January 1st and February 25th, 2021. This approach enabled us to detect 64 samples with peculiar non-sigmoidal amplification curves. Sequencing a selected group of 4 RNA viral genomes demonstrated that those curves were associated with B.1.1.7 variant strains. Our results strongly suggest that B.1.1.7 variant spread has begun in this area at least since January and imply the potential of these analytical methods to track and characterize the spread of B.1.1.7 strains in those areas where Allplex SARS-CoV-2 datasets have been previously recorded.","output":"A straightforward molecular strategy to retrospectively investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 VOC202012/01 B.1.1.7 variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The public role of Christianity in Africa has gained increased attention from scholars This article gives four snapshots of the responses of churches to COVID-19 in Africa in the early weeks of disease spread on the continent In many countries, churches are at the forefront of formal and informal health delivery and disease control, through medical services and faith healing An examination of different approaches of Christian communities to the pandemic shows the influence and the limits of Christian action as governments acted quickly to reduce the spread of COVID-19 Using research methods (remote interviews and surveys, and analysis of authors' own denominations or congregations) consonant with physical distancing measures, the authors observed Churches attempting to carry out their mission as measures were put in place to arrest disease They maintained worship services, moving them online They helped Christians make sense of the pandemic and offered themselves as repositories of public trust In some cases, however, they were less successful than they wished in carrying out their social responsibility because many of their institutions were closed as part of the measures to restrict the spread of disease [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Studies in World Christianity is the property of Edinburgh University Press and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"The Public Role of Churches in Early Responses to COVID-19 in Africa: Snapshots from Nigeria, Congo, Kenya and South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Contexte Les traumatismes au rugby ont fait lobjet de nombreuses tudes chez les adultes.

These substitutions modify the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor and have been implicated in altered host fitness, transmissibility and efficacy against antibody therapeutics and vaccines. Reliably predicting the binding strength of SARS-CoV-2 variants RBD to hACE2 receptor and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) can help assessing their fitness, and rapid deployment of effective antibody therapeutics, respectively. Here, we introduced a two-step computational framework with three-fold validation that first identified dissociation constant as a reliable predictor of binding affinity in hetero-dimeric and Ctrimeric protein complexes. The second step implements dissociation constant as descriptor of the binding strengths of SARS-CoV-2 variants RBD to hACE2 and NAbs. Then, we examined several variants of concern (VOCs) such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron and demonstrated that these VOCs RBD bind to the hACE2 with enhanced affinity. Furthermore, the binding affinity of Omicron variants RBD was reduced with majority of the RBD-directed NAbs, which is highly consistent with the experimental neutralization data. By studying the atomic contacts between RBD and NAbs, we revealed the molecular footprints of four NAbs (GH-12, P2B-1A1, Asarnow_3D11, and C118)  that may likely neutralize the recently emerged omicron variant  facilitating enhanced binding affinity.

BACKGROUND: Professional identity of nurses is not static and easily affected by many factors. The COVID-19 epidemic brings the tremendous physical and psychological challenges for rescue nurses. At present, there are limited data on the influence of rescue experiences on the nurses' professional identity. METHODS: This study used a face-to-face interview with semi-structured questions to learn about the influence of rescue experiences on the professional identity of nurses. Purposeful sampling was used to collect participants (n = 14), and interview data were analysed following the Colaizzi's phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: The 'impression of exhaustion and fear', 'feeling the unfairness', 'perceiving incompetence in rescue task' and 'unexpected professional benefits' were the main factors affecting the professional identity of rescue nurses. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that special attention and targeted support measures should be provided to improve the professional identity of rescue nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers should make a post-epidemic recovery plan to help nurses to improve the professional identity.

In this regard, an exploratory method was used to assess the perceptions of the entrepreneurs with rural tourism activities in the Azores Islands regarding the customers experiences and some other important aspects concerning the promotion of this type of tourism in the region. Throughout this study, it was possible to verify that the most relevant obstacles to the development of rural tourism in the Azores region are the preservation and conservation of nature and endogenous resources and delivering proper infrastructures and regional accessibilities.

However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: The North West Collaborative Organisation for Respiratory Research performed a multicentre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a 2-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to the hospital were recorded, including the Confusion, Urea, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure and Age Above or Below 65 Years (CURB-65), National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) and Quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across seven hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in the intensive care unit. All scores underestimated mortality compared with pre-COVID-19 cohorts, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the low-risk categories (CURB-65 score<2, NEWS2<5 and qSOFA score<2), 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. NEWS25 had a negative predictive value of 98% for early mortality. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION: In the setting of COVID-19, existing prognostic scores underestimated risk. The design of new prognostic tools should focus on features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse. We provide a baseline set of variables which are relevant to COVID-19 outcomes and may be used as a basis for developing a bespoke COVID-19 prognostication tool.","output":"Utility of established prognostic scores in COVID-19 hospital admissions: multicentre prospective evaluation of CURB-65, NEWS2 and qSOFA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Deceased donor kidney offers are frequently declined multiple times before acceptance for transplantation, despite significant organ shortage and long waiting times. Whether the number of times a kidney has been declined, reflecting cumulative judgments of clinicians, is associated with long-term transplant outcomes remains unclear. Methods In this national, retrospective cohort study of deceased donor kidney transplants in the United States from 2008 to 2015 (n=78,940), we compared donor and recipient characteristics and short- and long-term graft and patient survival outcomes grouping by the sequence number at which the kidney was accepted for transplantation. We compared outcomes for kidneys accepted within the first seven offers in the match-run, after 8-100 offers, and for hard-to-place kidneys distinguishing those requiring >100 and >1000 offers before acceptance. Results Harder-to-place kidneys had lower donor quality and higher rates of delayed graft function (46% among kidneys requiring >1000 offers before acceptance versus 23% among kidneys with 7 offers). In unadjusted models, later sequence groups had higher hazard of all-cause graft failure, death-censored graft failure, and patient mortality; however, these associations were attenuated after adjusting for Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI). After adjusting for donor factors already taken into consideration during allocation, and recipient factors associated with long-term outcomes, graft, and patient survival outcomes were not significantly different for the hardest-to-place kidneys compared with the easiest-to-place kidneys, with the exception of death-censored graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.16, 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.28).

To identify the biomarker of diagnosis for LUAD is of great significance. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were previously revealed to exert vital effects in numerous cancers. LncRNA long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 520 (LINC00520) served as an oncogene in various cancers. Therefore, our study was specially designed to probe the role of LINC00520 in LUAD. RESULTS: LINC00520 expression was detected by RT-qPCR. Next, function of LINC00520 in LUAD was verified by in vitro loss-of-function experiments. DNA pull down, ChIP, RIP, and luciferase reporter assays were conducted to reveal the regulatory mechanism of LINC00520. We found that LINC00520 was upregulated in LUAD. Additionally, LINC00520 upregulation is associated with the poor prognosis for patients with LUAD. Furthermore, LINC00520 downregulation suppressed LUAD cell proliferation and migration and induced cell apoptosis. Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) is identified as the transcription factor to transcriptionally activate LINC00520. Moreover, LINC00520 positively upregulated FOXP3 expression via sponging miR-3611 in LUAD cells. Subsequently, rescue experiments delineated that miR-3611 downregulation or FOXP3 overexpression reversed the effects of silenced LINC00520 on proliferative and migratory capabilities in LUAD cells. CONCLUSION: This study innovatively indicated that lncRNA LINC00520 facilitated cell proliferative and migratory abilities in LUAD through interacting with miR-3611 and targeting FOXP3, which may provide a potential novel insight for treatment of LUAD.

This study aims to determine differences in the serum 25(OH)D concentrations of Arab Gulf adult residents screened for SARS-CoV-2 and its association with risk of COVID-19 infection together with other comorbidities. METHODS: In this multi-center, caseCcontrol study, a total of 220 male and female adults presenting with none to mild symptoms were screened for COVID-19 (n = 138 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive and 82 negative controls). Medical history was noted. Anthropometrics were measured and non-fasting blood samples were collected for the assessment of glucose, lipids, inflammatory markers and serum 25(OH)D concentrations. RESULTS: Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group compared to the negative group after adjustment for age and BMI (52.8 nmol/l  11.0 versus 64.5 nmol/l  11.1; p = 0.009).

In the present multi-center study, we aimed to assess the differences underlying this association, and ascertain whether ethnicity also mediates other aspects of COVID-19 like cardiovascular complications. METHODS: Data were collected from a mixed-ethnicity UK cohort of 613 patients admitted and diagnosed COVID-19 positive, across six hospitals in London during the second half of March 2020: 292 were White Caucasian ethnicity, 203 were Asian and 118 were of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity. RESULTS: Caucasian patients were older (P<0.001) and less likely to have hypertension (P=0.038), while Afro-Caribbean patients had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (P<0.001). Asian patients were more likely to present with venous thromboembolic disease (adj.OR=4.10, 95% CI 1.49-11.27, P=0.006). On the other hand, Afro-Caribbean had more heart failure (adj.OR=3.64, 95% CI 1.50-8.84, P=0.004) and myocardial injury (adj.OR=2.64, 95% CI 1.10-6.35, P=0.030). Importantly, our adjusted multi-variate Cox regression analysis revealed significantly higher all-cause mortality both for Asian (adj.HR=1.89, 95% CI 1.23-2.91, P=0.004) and Afro-Caribbean ethnicity (adj.HR=2.09, 95% CI 1.30-3.37, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that COVID-19 may have different presentations and follow different clinical trajectories depending on the ethnicity of the affected subject. Awareness of complications more likely to arise in specific ethnicities will allow a more timely diagnosis and preventive measures for patients at risk.

In general, it is considered low comorbidity  3 points in CCI and high comorbidity > 3 points. Kaplan-Meier curves have been used for the statistical analysis of overall survival (OS) and cancer specific survival (CSS) and log-rank test to compare them. Results In the study, 24 pts had  3 points in CCI (48%) and 26 pts had > 3 points (52%). Mean CCS in pts with CCI 3 points was 18.5 months and in pts with CCI > 3 points was 13 months. 15-months CSS was 83.3% in pts with CCI  3 points and 40.9% in pts with CCI > 3 points without statistically significant differences (p 0.755). Mean OS in pts with CCI 3 points was 16.8 months and in pts with CCI > 3 points was 11.5 months.15-months OS was 74.3% in pts with CCI  3 points and 32% in pts with CCI > 3 points (p 0.620). Toxicity in both groups was similar without differences between pts with CCI  3 points and CCI > 3 points. Only one grade 3 oesophagitis was registered in CCI  3 points group. Conclusion The Charlson comorbidity index is a system that evaluates 10 years life expectancy. According to our results and despite the short follow-up, pts with CCI  3 points have better OS and CSS than pts with CCI > 3 points. In both groups, hypofractionated radiotherapy was well-tolerated regardless the CCI. Although more studies are needed, CCI can be an important factor to evaluate in patients with lung cancer because it identifies pts with a high probability of mortality. For this reason, this score can be an useful tool to assess the most suitable treatment option, especially in patients with several comorbidities.","output":"Influence of Charlson comorbidity index in hypofractionated radiotherapy treatment in lung cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every country, becoming a global health problem with social and economic consequences for years to come. To date, there are several agents under active investigation as potential treatments, among them is the interleukin-6 receptor blocker tocilizumab. Early observational studies have identified an association between the use of tocilizumab and a decreased risk of intubation and/or death, however randomized clinical trials have not found a significant benefit yet. The aim of our study was to assess whether the timing of tocilizumab influenced the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study involving 56 Ecuadorian patients treated with corticosteroids plus tocilizumab after a confirmed diagnosis of severe COVID-19 respiratory disease in the context of a hyperinflammatory state. A hyperinflammatory state was defined by the SIRS criteria plus at least 1 of the following three: i.) CRP &gt;100 mg/L, ii.) serum ferritin &gt;900 g/L on one occasion or a twofold increase of the level at admission within 48 hours;or iii.) D-dimer level &gt;1500 g/L. Descriptive statistics were reported. A point-biserial correlation was conducted to assess the relationship between symptomatic days prior treatment with survival status. Furthermore, a chi-square test for association was performed between corticosteroids/tocilizumab dosage and survival status. All the data was analyzed using SPSS, version 24.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For all test a p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Results: The sample mean age was 61.7 (SD 10.9) years with a 7:3 male/female ratio. 76.8% (n=43) patients survived with a mean time to hospital discharge of 11.5 days (SD 12.0). Regarding treatment, average days prior to corticosteroids administration was 2.6 (SD 2.5), while 11.1 (SD 9.0) was for tocilizumab. A statistically significant negative correlation between days prior tocilizumab administration and survival status was reported (rpb =-.290, n = 56, p = .030) (Figure 1). On the other hand, no significant association between tocilizumab dosage and survival status was determined (2 (5) = 3.566, p = .600). Same analyses with corticosteroids yielded non-significant results. Conclusion: Early administration of tocilizumab was associated with a greater likelihood of surviving, an observation that could not be reproduced with corticosteroids. The association between tocilizumab dosage and survival status, however, was not statistically significant. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm the exact role of the timing of tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19.

Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, initially received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2020. mAbs are typically administered in an outpatient setting via intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection and can prevent progression of COVID-19 if given after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result or for postexposure prophylaxis in patients at high risk for severe illness.? Dexamethasone, a commonly used steroid, and remdesivir, an antiviral drug that received EUA from FDA in May 2020, are used in inpatient settings and help prevent COVID-19 progression (2). No large-scale studies have yet examined the use of mAb by race and ethnicity. Using COVID-19 patient electronic health record data from 41 U.S. health care systems that participated in the PCORnet, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network,? this study assessed receipt of medications for COVID-19 treatment by race (White, Black, Asian, and Other races [including American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and multiple or Other races]) and ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic).

Currently, more evidence becomes available that the lockdowns may have more negative effects than positive effects. For instance, many measures taken in a lockdown aimed at protecting human life may compromise the immune system, and purpose in life, especially of vulnerable groups. This leads to the paradoxical situation of compromising the immune system and physical and mental health of many people, including the ones we aim to protect. Also, it is expected that hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger and postponed medical treatments. Other side effects include financial insecurity of billions of people, physical and mental health problems, and increased inequalities. The economic and health repercussions of the crisis will be falling disproportionately on young workers, low-income families and women, and thus exacerbate existing inequalities. As the virus outbreak and media coverage spread fear and anxiety, superstition, cognitive dissonance reduction and conspiracy theories are ways to find meaning and reduce anxiety. These behavioral aspects may play a role in the continuance of lockdown decisions.

Building on this, the German Network for Autopsies in Pandemics (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs) was established on 1 September 2020. RESULTS: The main goal of DeRegCOVID is to collect and distribute de facto anonymized data on potentially all autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 in Germany in order to meet the need for centralized, coordinated, and structured data collection and reporting during the pandemic. The success of the registry strongly depends on the willingness of the respective centers to report the data, which has developed very positively so far and requires special thanks to all participating centers. The rights to own data and biomaterials (stored decentrally) remain with each respective center. The DEFEAT PANDEMIcs network expands on this and aims to strengthen harmonization and standardization as well as nationwide implementation and cooperation in the field of pandemic autopsies.

The main aim of the current study was to explore if the intensity and directionality of maternal mood symptoms moderated the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems in Italian pre-schoolers from pre- to during the lockdown adopting a longitudinal design. To assess maternal anxiety and depression symptoms, the EPDS and the STAI-Y were filled in by 94 and 88 women before the lockdown, when their children were 1 (Wave P1) and 3 years old (Wave P2), respectively, and by 74 women during the lockdown, when their children were 4 years old (Wave L). Mothers also filled in the CBCL/1 ?C5 to assess their childrens emotional and behavioural problems at each assessment wave. As a whole, childrens emotional and behavioural problems significantly increased from pre- to during the lockdown. Furthermore, maternal mood moderated this trajectory.

Therefore, specific preventative measures including COVID-19 vaccines are especially important. Both anticancer therapies and the underlying malignancy itself can lead to significant immunosuppression posing a particular challenge for vaccination strategies in these patients. At the moment, four COVID-19 vaccines are European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved in Germany: two mRNA and two viral vector-based vaccines. All four vaccines show excellent protection against severe COVID-19. Their mechanism of action relies on the induction of the production of virus-specific proteins by human cells and the following activation of a specific adaptive immune response. Vaccination against COVID-19 has been prioritized for cancer patients and medical personnel in Germany. Regarding timing of vaccination, vaccination prior to initiation of anticancer therapy seems ideal in newly diagnosed disease. However, due to the significant risk of severe COVID-19 in cancer patients, vaccination is also strongly recommended for patients already undergoing anticancer therapy. In these patients, immune response might be reduced. In two particular patient cohorts, namely stem cell transplant recipients and patients treated with B?cell depleting agents, an interval of several months following therapy is recommended because otherwise the response to vaccination will most likely be severely reduced.

Methods ACGME case log reports of key procedures for orthopaedic sports medicine fellows during academic years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021 were extracted. Comparisons between these years in adult, pediatric and total case volumes were performed using two-sample T-test to detect significant changes in the average number of key procedures completed between consecutive years. Results There was a significant decrease in the total number of cases completed by fellows during the 2020 academic year (p = 0.043) compared to 2019, immediately followed by a significant increase in case volume in 2021 (p < 0.001) (2019, 339 +/- 123; 2020, 316.2 +/- 108; 2021, 356.5 +/- 117). There was a significant increase in adult case volume from 2020 to 2021 (2020, 295.7 +/- 106; 2021, 332.9 +/- 117; p < 0.001), while no trends were noted in pediatric case volume. Between the pre-pandemic year of 2019 and the first year of the pandemic, significant decreases were noted in case volume for several procedures, including multiligamentous knee injuries, knee instability and pediatric hip arthroscopy. From the first to the second years of the pandemic (2019-2020 to 2020-2021), significant increases were observed in case volume for rotator cuff, acromioclavicular instability, elbow instability, knee cartilage, and meniscal surgeries. Conclusions Orthopaedic sports medicine fellows experienced significant decreases in volume for several key case categories between the year preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and the first academic year during the pandemic. There were subsequent increases in cases between the first year of the pandemic and the second year, which may be associated with resuming elective surgical cases.","output":"Decreased Case Volume for Orthopaedic Sports Medicine Fellows During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a well-established practice that shows a reduced risk of wound infection compared with surgical tracheostomy, thus facilitating mechanical ventilation, nursing procedures, reduction in sedation and early mobilization. Objective This is an observational case-control study that compares the results of PT in ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prospectively enrolled to a similar group of subjects, retrospectively recruited, without COVID-19. Methods Ninety-eight consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU at Pisa Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana between March 11th and May 20 (th) , 2020 were prospectively studied. Thirty of them underwent PT using different techniques. Another 30 non-COVID-19 ICU patients were used as a control-group. The main outcome was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of PT in COVID-19 patients. We measured the rate of complications. Results Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed with different techniques in 30 of the 98 COVID-19 ICU patients admitted to the ICU. Tracheostomy was performed on day 10 (mean 10  3.3) from the time of intubation. Major tracheal complications occurred in 5 patients during the procedure. In the control group of 30 ICU patients, no differences were found with regards to the timing of the tracheostomy, whereas a statistically significant difference was observed regarding complications with only one tracheal ring rupture reported. Conclusion Percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients showed a higher rate of complications compared with controls even though the same precautions and the same expertise were applied.

Recent studies have shown the beneficial effects of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors on the enhancement of behavioral and pathological sequelae in Alzheimers disease. Despite the promising effects of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in Alzheimers disease, there is no irrefutable neuroprotective evidence in well-established animal models using epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors due to many un-explored downstream signaling pathways. This caused controversy about the potential involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in any prospective clinical trial. In this review, the mystery beyond the under-investigation of epidermal growth factor receptor in Alzheimers disease will be discussed. Furthermore, their molecular mechanisms in neurodegeneration will be explained. Also, we will shed light on SARS-COVID-19 induced neurological manifestations mediated by epidermal growth factor modulation. Finally, we will discuss future perspectives and under-examined epidermal growth factor receptor downstream signaling pathways that warrant more exploration.

Also where demand exceeding supply of healthcare, mortality was very high. As an island nation with one central main hospital, not overwhelming the healthcare system whilst avoiding total lockdown was key. DESCRIPTION: On the 27-03-2020, the Superintendent of Public Health enacted the Protection of Vulnerable Persons Order, specifying that these categories (or subcategories thereof) of persons are to be granted vulnerable status: age >65; pregnant; persons suffering from diabetes; immunosuppressed; cancer; end stage renal failure; respiratory disease; cardiac disease; heart failure. Such persons were entitled to stay at home, to be granted special leave from work, entitled to a monthly allowance by social services. One could go out only to attend to essential or urgent personal matters, e.g. groceries, medicines, medical needs, bank etc. with mitigation measures. Exemptions were only granted to special categories such as healthcare workers, farmers, or headship positions. In addition, the carers & staff of most nursing homes voluntarily decided to isolate themselves inside the homes for periods of 2/3 weeks. Thanks to a very active family support network, offspring, relatives or neighbours ran basic errands for them, or else organised deliveries. This legal status has been lifted on the 5th June 2020. RESULTS: This status was granted to 126 000 persons, including 14000 employed persons. Only 9 deaths occurred in Malta out of 664 cases in a population of 500000 up till 20th June 2020, with a case fatality rate of 1.35% - one of the lowest in Europe. LESSONS: Protection of vulnerable individuals can be a cornerstone of COVID-19 public health response if mobility is effectively restricted in this subpopulation. KEY MESSAGES: Protection of the vulnerable reduces healthcare & mortality burden. Effective legal & economic support measures, & extensive societal engagement required.","output":"'Cocooning' the vulnerable - a main pillar of Malta's COVID-19 response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Syncope represents a relatively uncommon symptom of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). It is likely that an impaired autonomic vasomotor response to the hemodynamic stress of tachycardia is the determinant of hemodynamic changes leading to cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope. In this regard, tilt-table test may detect abnormalities in the autonomic nervous function and predict the occurrence of syncope during SVT. Electrophysiology studies may reproduce the SVT, distinguish it from other life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and exclude other causes of syncope. Not infrequently mixed syncope mechanisms are revealed during the above diagnostic workup raising doubts about the operating mechanism in the clinical setting. In such cases of uncertainty, an implantable loop recorder, providing long-term cardiac monitoring, may play a pivotal role in the establishment of the diagnosis, confirming the association of an arrhythmic event with the symptom.

It is still debated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at a higher risk for developing COVID-19 or its complications. AIM: To assess geographical distribution of IBD patients at the highest risk and correlate these data with COVID-19 mortality rates in Brazil. METHODS: The Brazilian IBD Study Group (Grupo de Estudos da Doen?a Inflamatria Intestinal do Brasil) developed a web-based survey adapted from the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. The included categories were demographic data and inquiries related to risk factors for complications from COVID-19. Patients were categorized as highest, moderate or lowest individual risk. The Spearman correlation test was used to identify any association between highest risk and mortality rates for each state of the country. RESULTS: A total of 3568 patients (65.3% females) were included. Most participants were from the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil, and 84.1% were using immunomodulators and/or biologics. Most patients (55.1%) were at moderate risk, 23.4% were at highest risk and 21.5% were at lowest risk of COVID-19 complications. No association between the proportion of IBD patients at highest risk for COVID-19 complications and higher mortality rates was identified in different Brazilian states (r = 0.146, P = 0.467). CONCLUSION: This study indicates a distinct geographical distribution of IBD patients at highest risk for COVID-19 complications in different states of the country, which may reflect contrasting socioeconomic, educational and healthcare aspects.

In an earlier study, we examined the transferability of the revised glycosidic torsion parameters ((IDRP)) for  to its derivatives. We noticed that although these parameters in combination with the AMBER FF99-derived parameters and the revised  torsional parameters resulted in conformational properties of these residues that were in better agreement with experimental observations, the sugar pucker distributions were still not reproduced accurately. Here we report a new set of partial atomic charges for pseudouridine, 1-methylpseudouridine, 3-methylpseudouridine and 2-O-methylpseudouridine and a new set of glycosidic torsional parameters ((ND)) based on chosen glycosidic torsional profiles that most closely corresponded to the NMR data for conformational propensities and studied their effect on the conformational distributions using REMD simulations at the individual nucleoside level. We have also studied the effect of the choice of water model on the conformational characteristics of these modified nucleosides. Our observations suggest that the current revised set of parameters and partial atomic charges describe the sugar pucker distributions for these residues more accurately and that the choice of a suitable water model is important for the accurate description of their conformational properties. We have further validated the revised sets of parameters by studying the effect of substitution of uridine with pseudouridine within single stranded RNA oligonucleotides on their conformational and hydration characteristics.

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is one of the branches of smart cities that aim to achieve better traffic efficiency. The intelligent transport system optimizes the traffic congestion control by acquiring real time data. Optimized traffic congestion control demands a robust system that could count the number of people inside a carrier for taking optimized decisions. In this paper we proposed an intelligent algorithm named Modified Intelligent Centroid Tracker and Counter (MICTC) that could detect, count, and measure the distance between humans in a closed and controlled environment. The proposed algorithm is vision based and the scope of the work is to optimize the congestion control inside the passenger carrier and supports countless use cases like smart transport, buildings, and other demography where social distancing is enforced. MICTC algorithm not only offers visual indication with a bounding box but also generates metadata which gives a clear picture to the concerned operational or administrative head regarding the current passenger count status.

DESIGN: Retrospective review of patients discussed in a virtual MDT panel. Independent pre-intervention and post-intervention data from Public Health England. SETTING: Paediatric departments across North West England. PATIENTS: Children aged <16 years with suspected TB infection/disease. INTERVENTION: Weekly, virtual MDT discussion between district paediatricians and a tertiary TB team. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Care closer to home, time from presentation to treatment. RESULTS: 45% (37 of 82) children received care closer to home. Median time from presentation to treatment reduced by 28% (from 18 to 13 days). 21% more children were diagnosed before developing symptoms (76% of children presented with symptoms pre-intervention, 55% post-intervention). 5 children incorrectly labelled with latent TB infection were treated for TB disease.

IgRT may be appropriate if IgG level < 4 g/l and/or 1C3 less severe infections ( grade 2). METHODS: This was a retrospective sample analysis representative for practices and hospitals in Germany. The treatments and infection data were collected from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM). GL adherence (GLAD) was analyzed. RESULTS: Data from 1086 patients (CLL 490, MM 596) were collected from 86 centers. Of all patients, 34.8% developed IgG deficiency during therapy (CLL 35.5%; MM 34.2%). IgRT was given in 23.5% of CLL and 14.4% of MM patients. GLAD in hypogammaglobulinemia and indication to IgRT was 23.3% of 86 CLL and 22.1% of 77 MM patients. Without GLAD, the hazard ratio (HR) for any infection was 4.49 (95% CI 3.72C5.42; p < 0.001) and for severe infections (grade  3) 10.64 (95% CI 7.54C15.00; p < 0.001). Significant independent risk factors for infections were a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, IgG deficiency, and 3(rd) + line treatment, as well as therapy with BTK inhibitors or chemotherapy in CLL. Multivariable analysis showed a significantly lower risk of severe infections after start of IgRT with a HR of 0.47 (95% CI 0.28C0.77; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Guideline adherence correlated with fewer and less severe infections but was low in patients with indication to IgRT. Risk factors for infection can be identified. Risk of severe infections was significantly lower in patients with IgRT.

However, decreases in sleep quality rather than duration are associated with adverse mental health effects. Additionally, the one third of the general population suffering from poor sleep quality was underrepresented in previous studies. The current study aimed to elucidate effects of the COVID -19 pandemic on sleep quality across different levels of pre-pandemic sleep complaints and as a function of affect and worry. METHOD: Participants (n = 667) of the Netherlands Sleep Registry (NSR) were invited for weekly online assessment of the subjective severity of major stressors, insomnia, sleep times, distress, depression, and anxiety using validated scales. ANALYSIS: To investigate the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sleep quality of people with and without a history of insomnia, we performed a mixed model analysis using pre-pandemic insomnia severity, negative affect, and worry as predictors. RESULTS: The effect of COVID -19 on sleep quality differs critically across participants, and depends on the pre-pandemic sleep quality. Interestingly, a quarter of people with pre-pandemic (clinical) insomnia experienced a meaningful improvement in sleep quality, whereas 20% of pre-pandemic good sleepers experienced worse sleep during the lockdown measures. Additionally, changes in sleep quality throughout the pandemic were associated with negative affect and worry. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that there is no uniform effect of the lockdown on sleep quality. COVID-19 lockdown measures more often worsened sleep complaints in pre-pandemic good sleepers, whereas a subset of people with pre-pandemic severe insomnia symptoms underwent a clinically meaningful alleviation of symptoms in our sample.","output":"Sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic: not one size fits all"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: Several reports have shown the persistence of long term symptoms after the initial COVID-19 infection (post-COVID-19 syndrome). The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) performed in patients with a history of COVID-19, comparing subjects according to the presence of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed. Consecutive patients > 18 years with history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction test and a CPET performed between 45 and 120 days after the viral episode were included. The association between variables related to CPET and post-COVID-19 syndrome was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 200 patients (mean age 48.8  14.3 years, 51% men) were included. Patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome showed significantly lower main peak VO(2) (25.8  8.1 mL/min/Kg vs. 28.8  9.6 mL/min/Kg, p=0.017) as compared to asymptomatic subjects. Moreover, patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome developed symptoms more frequently during CPET (52.7% vs. 13.7%, p<0.001) and were less likely to reach the anaerobic threshold (50.9% vs. 72.7%, p=0.002) when compared to asymptomatic subjects. These findings were not modified when adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: Our data suggest that post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with less peak VO(2), a lower probability of achieving the anaerobic threshold and a higher probability of presenting symptoms during the CPET.

Over the past few years, improvements and enhancements have been brought forward and they have shown some promising results in solving the complex dynamic problems, systems of ordinary differential equations where the objective functions are computationally expensive to evaluate. Besides, the straightforward implementation of the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performs well merely for optimization problems with 10-20 dimensions. The study presented in this paper proposes a new high dimensional Bayesian Optimization algorithm combining Recurrent neural networks, which is expected to predict the optimal solution for the global optimization problems with high dimensional or time series decision models. The proposed RNN-BO algorithm can solve the optimal control problems in the lower dimension space and then learn from the historical data using the recurrent neural network to learn the historical optimal solution data and predict the optimal control strategy for any new initial system value setting. In addition, accurately and quickly providing the optimal control strategy is essential to effectively and efficiently control the epidemic spread while minimizing the associated financial costs. Therefore, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are carried out on a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and a stochastic SIS optimal control model. Finally, we also discuss the impacts of different numbers of the RNN layers and training epochs on the trade-off between solution quality and related computational efforts.","output":"High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization Algorithm with Recurrent Neural Network for Disease Control Models in Time Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 infection primarily causes severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure requiring a ventilator support.

This observational study was performed with patients who lived in Unnan City. Patients dependency and changes in comprehensiveness of medical services were assessed and calculated. The total usage of medical care decreased from 2018 to 2020 at all medical care levels. The proportion of patients who received comprehensive care was higher in 2020 than in 2018, at all care levels. At care dependent levels 3 to 5, the differences in the proportions were statistically significant. This study illustrates an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the proportion of comprehensiveness of medical care among older rural patients with a decrease in medical care usage. Moreover, an improved proportion of comprehensiveness of medical care leads to appropriate HSBs.

More so in the low- and middle-income countries where ambulation is the predominant means of getting around for the majority of the population in order to earn a livelihood. This has necessitated the equipping of the new generation of orthopaedic surgeons with the expertise and skills set to manage these conditions. To address this need, surgeons from the British Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (BOFAS) and College of Surgeons of Eastern, Central and Southern Africa (COSECSA) transferred the Principles of Foot and Ankle Surgery course to an African regional setting. The course was offered to surgical trainees from 14-member countries of the COSECSA region and previously in the UK. The faculty was drawn from practicing surgeons experienced in both surgical education and foot and ankle surgery. The course comprises didactic lectures, case-based discussions in small groups, patient evaluations and guided surgical dissections on human cadavers. It was offered free to all participants. The feasibility of the course was evaluated using the model defined by Bowen considering the eight facets of acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, adaptation, integration, expansion and limited efficacy. At the end of the course participants were expected to give verbal subjective feedback and objective feedback using a cloud based digital feedback questionnaire. The course content was evaluated by the participants as Poor, Below average, Average, Good and Excellent, which was converted into a value from 1C5 for analysis. The non-parametric categorical data was analysed using the Two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (MannCWhitney) test, and significance was considered to be p < 0.05. RESULTS: Six courses in total were held between 2018 and 2020. Three in the UK and three in the COSECSA region. There were 78 participants in the three UK courses and 96 in the three courses run in the COSECSA region. Hundred percent of the UK participants and 97% of the COSECSA participants completed the feedback. Male to female ratio was 4:1 for the UK courses and 10:1 for the COSECSA Courses. In both regions all the participants responded that they would recommend the course to their colleagues. Among the COSECSA participants 91% reported that the course was pitched at the right level, which is similar to the 89% of the UK participants (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION: The BOFAS Principles of Foot and Ankle Surgery course design provides core knowledge, with an emphasis on clinical examination techniques of the foot and ankle, while at the same time, caters for the anticipated difference in the local clinical case mix and resources. This study establishes that by attending the course surgical trainees can achieve their learning goals in foot and ankle surgery with the same high quality qualitative and quantitative feedback in both regions. This would improve their clinical practice and confidence. The multifaceted approach adopted in this course blending didactic teaching, small group discussions, interactive sessions, case-based discussions, cadaveric surgical skills training printed educational materials and feedback helped fulfil these educational objectives. Working in partnership with local expert orthopaedic surgeons from a number of Sub-Saharan countries, was key to adapting the course to local pathology and the COSECSA setting.","output":"Feasibility of delivering foot and ankle surgical courses in a partnership in Eastern, Central and Sothern Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the healthcare system, including dentistry.

This involvement could help explaining the pathogenesis of this condition and lead to novel therapeutic approaches. OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients during the Italian pandemic outbreak, as reported by physicians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the early days of pandemic emergence we developed an online survey open to all Italian clinicians involved in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. The survey was structured in three sections, with nine different items concerning the presence of different specific clinical abnormalities. Each item was graded from \\"absent\\" to \\"severe\\" in a 4-point Likert's scale. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Likert's scale data were analyzed by studying the distribution of responses by using medians and bar charts-relative frequencies. Also, in order to analyze differences in symptoms findings depending on the group of specialty, Likert's scale data were combined into two nominal categories (\\"absent\\"/\\"low\\" and \\"moderate\\"/\\"high\\"/\\") and a contingency table chi-square test was used. RESULTS: 126 physicians of 9 different medical specialties, from 10 regions of Italy, filled the online survey. The results show that 87.3% of practitioners reported neurological symptoms. In most cases these were mild and non-specific, but they were severe in a minority of patients. The most common symptoms observed were headache, myalgia and taste and smell abnormalities. Whilst there was no difference between neurologists and non-neurologists, we found that experienced clinicians (defined as clinicians that evaluated more than 30 patients) reported neurological symptoms more frequently than non-expert. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms have frequently been ported during the Italian COVID-19 pandemic, and thus should be monitored for all affected patients. Whilst some of the disturbances reported may be non-specific and common to other infectious diseases, smell and taste abnormalities might indicate nervous system as entry door for SARS-CoV-2 virus. This interpretation should promote research trials to avoid nervous system involvement.","output":"Neurological symptoms in acute COVID-19 infected patients: A survey among Italian physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid 19 Pandemisi, ?at??ma ve g??ler zerinde ?nemli etkileri olmu?tur.

Polarization tends to increase cognitive inflexibility where people become less capable of updating their beliefs upon new information or switching between different ways of thinking. Cognitive inflexibility can in turn increase polarization. We propose that this positive feedback loop between polarization and cognitive inflexibility is a form of threat response that has benefited humans throughout their evolutionary history. This feedback loop, which can be driven by conflict mindset, group conformity, and simplification of information, facilitates the formation of strong bonds within a group that are able to eliminate threats and increase individual fitness. Although cognitive inflexibility is conventionally seen as maladaptive, here we argue that cognitive inflexibility may be an adaptation under polarization. That is, in a highly polarized society most people only interact with members of their own social group, without having to confront perspectives from another group or interacting with out-group members. In this context, cognitive inflexibility creates rigid cognitive specialization, a set of cognitive traits that allow people to operate efficiently within their social circles but not outside of it. Although rigid cognitive specialization benefits individuals in the short term, it may lead to more polarization over the long run, and thus produce more conflict between groups. We call on future research to examine the link between cognitive inflexibility and rigid cognitive specialization.","output":"A Framework on Polarization, Cognitive Inflexibility, and Rigid Cognitive Specialization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the rapid spread of COVID-19 to almost every part of the globe, huge volumes of data and case studies have been made available, providing researchers with a unique opportunity to find trends and make discoveries like never before by leveraging such big data. This data is of many different varieties and can be of different levels of veracity, e.g., precise, imprecise, uncertain, and missing, making it challenging to extract meaningful information from such data. Yet, efficient analyses of this continuously growing and evolving COVID-19 data is crucial to inform  often in real-time  the relevant measures needed for controlling, mitigating, and ultimately avoiding viral spread. Applying machine learning-based algorithms to this big data is a natural approach to take to this aim since they can quickly scale to such data and extract the relevant information in the presence of variety and different levels of veracity. This is important for COVID-19 and potential future pandemics in general. In this paper, we design a straightforward encoding of clinical data (on categorical attributes) into a fixed-length feature vector representation and then propose a model that first performs efficient feature selection from such representation. We apply this approach to two clinical datasets of the COVID-19 patients and then apply different machine learning algorithms downstream for classification purposes. We show that with the efficient feature selection algorithm, we can achieve a prediction accuracy of more than 90% in most cases. We also computed the importance of different attributes in the dataset using information gain. This can help the policymakers focus on only certain attributes to study this disease rather than focusing on multiple random factors that may not be very informative to patient outcomes.

Recently, as vaccines have become more readily available, organizations and educational institutions have started shifting from virtual environments to physical office spaces and schools. For the highest level of safety and caution with respect to the containment of COVID-19, the shift to in-person interaction requires a thoughtful approach. With the help of an Integer Programming (IP) Optimization model, it is possible to formulate the objective function and constraints to determine a safe way of returning to the office through cohort development.

METHODSWe used a test-negative design within a national COVID-19 surveillance system to assess VE of the BNT162b2, mRNA-12732, Gam-COVID-Vac, Ad5-nCoV, Ad26.COV2.S, ChAdOx1 and CoronaVac vaccines, against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospitalization and death for adults []18 years in Mexico. VE was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models considering time-varying vaccination status in partial and fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated adults, adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities and municipality. We also estimated VE for adults []60 years, for cases with diabetes and comparing periods with predominance of variants B.1.1.519 and B.1.617.2.

RECENT FINDINGS The advent of microbiome research has expanded the potential role of microbes in asthma. There has been a significant increase in our understanding of the pathologic, genetic, cellular and molecular mechanisms of asthma. Nonetheless, the contribution of microbes to the genesis, exacerbation and treatment of asthma are poorly understood. SUMMARY Asthma is a complex chronic disease of the lung whose incidence is growing at all ages despite the progress that has been made in the areas of diagnosis and treatment of asthma. The complexity is partly due to the environmental insults such as allergens and microbial infections that play differential roles in the pathogenesis of childhood vis--vis elderly asthma.

Methods The questionnaire was distributed online during two different time periods in 2020 (February 27CMarch 21) and in 2021 (February 27CMarch 27). The first data collection phase was immediately before the first strict lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, and the second data collection phase was during the second lockdown. The survey was composed of validated questionnaires and additional questions regarding the changes in sleep/bedtimes and the status of lectures during the lockdown phase. Results The average Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) score in the sample decreased during the lockdown phase, corresponding to the fact that students were less burdened with daytime sleepiness. Moreover, the sample had earlier rise and earlier bedtimes on free days during the lockdown period. Furthermore, the increase in flexible learning times brought about by the pandemic negatively impacted the students lifestyle and increased irregularities in sleeping habits. Conclusion Significant changes in sleeping patterns seem to be attributable to the pandemic lockdown as found in this self-reported student survey. While daytime sleepiness decreased and earlier overall bedtimes were noted, the impact on the irregularity of sleeping and learning patterns seems to be the most notable finding, as this affects overall quality of life and learning performance. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.","output":"Impact of pandemic lockdown on learning behaviour and sleep quality in German students : Results of an online survey before and during the pandemic Auswirkungen eines pandemiebedingten Lockdowns auf Lernverhalten und Schlafqualit?t bei deutschen StudierendenErgebnisse einer Online-Umfrage vor und w?hrend der Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Science and technology are changing.

Since semester 2017A (17A), the NRAO has taken the following steps: (1) inform science review panels (SRPs) and the telescope time allocation committee (TAC) about the gender imbalance; and (2) increase the female representation on SRPs and the TAC to reflect the community demographics.

The investigation of the solution was made by focusing on the space-fractional diffusion equation (SFDE) problem. Note that the symmetry of an efficient approximation to the SFDE based on a numerical method is related to the compatibility of a discretization scheme and a linear system solver. The application of the one-dimensional, linear, unconditionally stable, and implicit finite difference approximation to SFDE was studied. The general differential equation of the SFDE was discretized using the space-fractional derivative of Caputo with a half-sweep finite difference scheme. The implicit approximation to the SFDE was formulated, and the formation of a linear system with a coefficient matrix, which was large and sparse, is shown. The construction of a general preconditioned system of equation is also presented. This studys contribution is the introduction of a half-sweep preconditioned successive over relaxation (HSPSOR) method for the solution of the SFDE-based system of equation. This work extended the use of the HSPSOR as an efficient numerical method for the time-fractional diffusion equation, which has been presented in the 5th North American International Conference on industrial engineering and operations management in Detroit, Michigan, USA, 10C14 August 2020. The current work proposed several SFDE examples to validate the performance of the HSPSOR iterative method in solving the fractional diffusion equation.

The pandemic calls for rapid mobilization of every potential clinical tool, including phototherapyone of the most effective treatments used to reduce the impact of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. This paper cites several studies showing that phototherapy has immense potential to reduce the impact of coronavirus diseases, and offers suggested ways that the healthcare industry can integrate modern light technologies in the fight against COVID-19 and other infections. The evidence shows that violet/blue (400C470 nm) light is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria, and that it accounts for Niels Ryberg Finsen's Nobel-winning treatment of tuberculosis. Further evidence shows that blue light inactivates several viruses, including the common flu coronavirus, and that in experimental animals, red and near infrared light reduce respiratory disorders, similar to those complications associated with coronavirus infection. Moreover, in patients, red light has been shown to alleviate chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma. These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder. The ubiquity of inexpensive light emitting lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), makes it relatively easy to develop safe low-cost light-based devices with the potential to reduce infections, sanitize equipment, hospital facilities, emergency care vehicles, homes, and the general environment as pilot studies have shown.","output":"Light as a potential treatment for pandemic coronavirus infections: A perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A COVID-19 vaccine mandate is being introduced for health and social care workers in England, and those refusing to comply will either be redeployed or have their employment terminated.

First, it ignores their genuine concerns, and fails to respect their moral integrity and bodily autonomy. Second, it risks causing psychological reactance, potentially worsening vaccine hesitancy. Third, Black and minority ethnic workers are less likely to have been vaccinated and therefore may be disproportionately impacted by the implications of the mandate. Fourth, a mandate could have a significant negative effect on service provision. Fifth, waning immunity and new variants mean that booster doses are increasingly likely to be regularly required, meaning that what constitutes being 'fully vaccinated' will be a constantly shifting target. Finally, vaccine mandates may have an adverse effect on health and social care recruitment. We argue that daily rapid antigen testing is a viable alternative to a vaccine mandate that is non-coercive and fair.

RESULTS 767 articles were identified; 54 were included (n=31 065 athletes). 4 studies reported days until RTS (range: 0-8.5 days). Frequency (%) of time loss >1 day after ARill was 20.4% (95% CI 15.3% to 25.4%). The mean symptom duration for all ARill was 7.1 days (95% CI 6.2 to 8.0).

Over a four-year period, we tracked whole-system water fluxes in a two-tier rain garden network and assessed near-surface hydrology and soil development across construction and operational phases. The monitoring data provided a quantitative basis for determining effectiveness of this stormwater control measure. Based on 233 monitored warm-season rainfall events, nearly half of total inflow volume was detained, with 90 percent of all events producing no flow to the combined sewer. For the events that did result in flow to the combined sewer system, the rain garden delayed flows for an average of 5.5 h. Multivariate analysis of hydrologic fluxes indicated that total event rainfall depth was a predominant hydrologic driver for network outflow during both phases, with average event intensity and daily evapotranspiration as additional, independent factors in regulating retention in the operational phase. Despite sediment loads that can clog the rooting zone, and overall lower-than-design infiltration rates, tradeoffs among soil profile development and hydrology apparently maintained relatively high overall retention effectiveness.

At the time of writing this article, there are officially about five million infections and more than 300 000 deaths. Statistics vary widely from country to country, revealing significant differences in anticipation and management of the crisis. We propose to examine the COVID-19 epidemic in Tunisia through mathematical models, which aim to determine the actual number of infected cases and to predict the course of the epidemic. As of May 11, 2020, there are officially 1032 COVID-19 infected cases in Tunisia. 45 people have died. Using a mathematical model based on the number of reported infected cases, the number of deaths, and the effect of the 18-day delay between infection and death, this study estimates the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Tunisia as 2555 cases. This paper analyses the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia using population dynamics with an SEIR model combining susceptible cases S(t), asymptomatic infected cases A(t), reported infected cases V (t), and unreported infected cases U(t). This work measures the basic reproduction number R0, which is the average number of people infected by a COVID-19 infected person. The model predicts an R0 = 2.73. Strict containment measures have led to a significant reduction in the reproduction rate. Contact tracing and respect for isolation have an impact: at the current time, we compute that Tunisia has an Rt = 0.42 (95% CI 0.14-0.70). These values depend on physical separation and can vary over time depending on the management of suspicious cases. Their objective estimation and the study of their evolution are however necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable or unreliable tests).","output":"A pandemic at the Tunisian scale.

An MI rat model and a PVN-TLR4 knockdown model were constructed. The levels of protein were detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence, and localizations were visualized by multiple immunofluorescence staining. Central and peripheral sympathetic activation was visualized by immunohistochemistry for c-fos protein, renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) measurement, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and norepinephrine (NE) level detection in serum and myocardial tissue measured by ELISA. The arrhythmia scores were measured by programmed electrical stimulation (PES), and cardiac function was detected by the pressure-volume loop (P-V loop). The levels of TLR4 and MyD88 and the nuclear translocation of NF-kB within the PVN were increased after MI, while sympathetic activation and arrhythmia scores were increased and cardiac function was decreased. However, inhibition of TLR4 significantly reversed these conditions.

The knee-jerk reaction is often pessimism about surgical trainings future, particularly in the Improved Surgical Training (IST) pilots context. However, Einstein famously once said, In the midst of every crises lies great opportunity. Unlocking growth during periods of high uncertainty is a premise of real options theory; one utilised by supply chain managers and decision scientists, but novel to medical education. This study explores the growth options that have resulted from new operational models during the pandemic. METHOD: Using a qualitative case study approach, data were obtained from interviews with core surgical trainees across Scotland. Data coding and inductive thematic analysis were undertaken. RESULTS: Forty-six trainees participated. Analysis from trainees perspective revealed: unexpected fulfilment from redeployment to non-surgical specialties, benefits to personal development from the unintended broad-based training across surgical specialties, improved collaborative teamworking between specialties and allied healthcare professionals, and enhanced supervised learning opportunities. Institutional growth options reported by trainees included: rapid uptake of telemedicine and digital technology, implementation of single hospital episode encounters for minor conditions, streamlined processes in theatre and acute admissions, and changes in working culture towards rationalising and teamworking. CONCLUSIONS: Growth options have been deliberately and unintentionally unlocked due to individual and institutional adaptions and innovations in response to the exogenous disruption.

Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengidentifikasi penggunaan antikoagulan pada pasien COVID-19 dan melihat pengaruhnya terhadap nilai D-Dimer. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian deskriptif retrospektif dengan model rancangan belah lintang (cross-sectional study). Pada studi ini menggambarkan bahwa pasien laki-laki cenderung lebih banyak terinfeksi SARS-CoV-2 (67%) dibandingkan perempuan (33%). Rentang usia 18-50 tahun merupakan usia yang paling tinggi dampak COVID-19 sebesar 47%. Enoxaparin merupakan antikoagulan yang paling banyak digunakan (44,7%) diikuti dengan Fondaparinux (42,1%) dan Heparin Na (7,90%). Evaluasi nilai D-Dimer menunjukkan terjadinya penurunan kadar dari awal pemeriksaan dan sebelum pasien keluar dari rumah sakit. Rata-rata kadar D-Dimer saat pemeriksaan awal 1839 ng/mL sedangkan pemeriksaan akhir sebelum keluar dari rumah sakit menjadi 799,37 ng/mL. Berdasarkan penemuan tersebut dapat dikatakan jika pemberian antikoagulan dapat bermanfaat menurunkan nilai D-Dimer sehingga diharapkan dapat menurunkan risiko mortalitas serta meningkatkan perbaikan kondisi pasien.","output":"Gambaran penggunaan antikoagulan pada pasien COVID-19 di salah satu rumah sakit rujukan COVID-19 di kota Semarang"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There have been significant advancements in different aspects of management of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Our review of the most recent literature focuses on severity prediction, fluid resuscitation, analgesic administration, nutrition, and endoscopic intervention for SAP and its extra-pancreatic complications. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies on serum cytokines for the prediction of SAP have shown superior prognostic performance when compared with conventional laboratory tests and clinical scoring systems. In patients with established SAP and vascular leak syndrome, intravenous fluids should be administered with caution to prevent intra-abdominal hypertension and volume overload. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography improves outcomes only in AP patients with suspected cholangitis. Early enteral tube-feeding does not appear to be superior to on-demand oral feeding. Abdominal compartment syndrome is a highly lethal complication of SAP that requires percutaneous drainage or decompressive laparotomy. Endoscopic transmural drainage followed by necrosectomy (i.e., step-up approach) is the treatment strategy of choice in patients with symptomatic or infected walled-off pancreatic necrosis. SUMMARY: SAP is a complex clinical syndrome associated with a high mortality rate. Early prediction of SAP remains challenging due to the limited accuracy of the available prediction tools. Early fluid resuscitation, organ support, enteral nutrition, and prevention of/or prompt recognition of abdominal compartment syndrome remain cornerstones of its management. A step-up, minimally invasive drainage/debridement is the preferred approach for patients with infected pancreatic necrosis.","output":"Management of Severe Acute Pancreatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA viruses rapidly mutate, which can result in increased virulence, increased escape from vaccine protection, and false negative detection results. Targeted detection methods have a limited ability to detect unknown viruses and often provide insufficient data to detect coinfections or identify antigenic variants. Random, deep sequencing is a method that can more fully detect and characterize RNA viruses and is often coupled with molecular techniques or culture methods for viral enrichment. Viral culture coupled with third-generation sequencing were tested for the ability to detect and characterize RNA viruses. Cultures of bovine viral diarrhea virus, canine distemper virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, two influenza A viruses, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus were sequenced on the MinION platform using a random, reverse primer in a strand-switching reaction, coupled with PCR-based barcoding. Reads were taxonomically classified and used for reference-based sequence building using a stock personal computer. This method accurately detected and identified complete coding sequence genomes with a minimum of 20 coverage depth for all seven viruses, including a sample containing two viruses. Each lineage-typing region had at least 26 coverage depth for all viruses. Furthermore, analyzing the canine distemper virus sample through a pipeline devoid of canine distemper virus reference sequences modeled the ability of this protocol to detect unknown viruses. These results show the ability of this technique to detect and characterize dsRNA, negative- and positive-sense ssRNA, nonsegmented, and segmented RNA viruses.","output":"Randomly primed, strand-switching MinION-based sequencing for the detection and characterization of cultured RNA viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main object of the study was to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 molecular and serological pattern in patients with mild symptoms including anosmia and ageusia A cohort of 69 patients with olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs) were enrolled and prospectively monitored Serological and molecular assays for the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and SARS-CoV-2 RNA, respectively, were performed at the time of enrolment and after 7 and 14 days Patients were stratified according to the symptoms&rsquo;onset A total of 52 patients (75 4%) were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive being SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive The remaining 17 (24 6%) were negative for COVID-19 and excluded from the analysis We reported that only 34 out of 52 patients (65 4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA Moreover, the median time from onset of symptoms and enrolment was significantly higher in those patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swabs, suggesting that symptoms might last longer than SARS-CoV-2 replication The great majority of patients (80%) developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG at three weeks after symptoms&rsquo;onset while the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA dramatically decreased over time, suggesting the crucial role of combination of molecular and serological assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in those patients reporting mild symptoms","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Virologic and Immunologic Correlates in Patients with Olfactory and Taste Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Endothelial function by flow-mediated dilatation assesses early markers of atherosclerotic progression. Greater amounts of physical activity and physical fitness in children are associated with cardiovascular health benefits. We aimed to explore factors, influencing endothelial function and arterial compliance in a cohort of healthy school children. METHODS: The 94 participants (41 girls, 53 boys) in the study were young, healthy children from a German school cohort. Anthropometric data, body composition and blood pressure were assessed. Blood was drawn (8 h overnight fast), assessing total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein and triglycerides. Endothelial function was diagnosed by flow-mediated dilatation with ultrasonography (ALOKA/Hitachi, Prosound alpha 6). Tracking gates were set on the intima in B-mode. The waveform of diameter changes over the cardiac cycle was displayed in real time using the FMD-mode of the eTRACKING system. Changes in arterial diameter at baseline, ischaemia and vasodilatation were measured. A symptom limited pulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer was performed to test cardiorespiratory fitness. Physical activity was assessed using GT3x accelerometers (Actigraph, USA), over 4 days (including 1 week-end day), with a minimum wear-time duration of 10 h. RESULTS: The median age was 12.2 years (11.8C12.8). Children were normal weight, blood lipid profiles (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride) were in normal range. Baseline measurements during the diagnostics of endothelial function revealed higher arterial compliance of the brachial artery in boys. Boys' cardiorespiratory fitness was higher than compared to girls. Boys met the recommendations of 60 min moderate to vigorous activity, whereas girls were significantly less active and did not meet current recommendations. More time spent in sedentary activity was the main predictor for lower arterial compliance (adjusted for age and sex), accounting for 14% of the variance. No significant model revealed, analyzing the influencing factors such as anthropometric data, blood lipids, physical activity and fitness on endothelial function. CONCLUSION: This is the first study on endothelial function in association to objectively measured physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy school children in Germany. The study highlights the importance of reducing time spent being sedentary to maintain endothelial health.","output":"Sedentary Behavior in Childhood, Lower Arterial Compliance and Decreased Endothelial Function-Cross Sectional Data From a German School Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions to food systems, leading to both food shortages and food waste across the supply chain. These disruptions have, in turn, altered how people consume and then ultimately discard food. To better understand these impacts, their underlying drivers, and their sustainability implications, this study surveyed U.S. consumers about food purchasing, use, and waste behaviors during the pandemic. Survey respondents reported an increase in overall food purchases and a slight decrease in food waste generation due to the pandemic, but the linkages between these outcomes and underlying behaviors were complex. For instance, reduced household food waste was significantly correlated with an increase in behaviors such as meal planning, preserving foods, and using leftovers and shelf-stable items. On the other hand, behaviors aimed at self-sufficiency, including bulk purchasing and stockpiling, were significantly correlated with increased food purchase, which in turn led to increased waste. Results may offer insight for future resource and waste management strategies. For example, over 60% of respondents who started or increased efficient food use behaviors stated an intent to continue these activities after the pandemic. In contrast, less than 10% of respondents reported that they began or increased separating or composting food waste during the pandemic, and many stopped altogether due to suspension of local curbside composting services. Findings suggest that it may be easier to shift food consumption and use behaviors but more challenging to alter food waste separation behaviors, particularly those influenced by external factors, such as infrastructure that may be vulnerable to disruption. Identifying ways to facilitate ongoing behavior change and foster robust food waste management systems can contribute to resilience of food systems now and once the immediate threat of the pandemic has subsided.","output":"Behavioral impacts on residential food provisioning, use, and waste during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first pediatric study demonstrating significantly higher positivity rate of nasal (mid-turbinate) swab testing over oropharyngeal swab testing in detecting SARS-CoV-2 (Fisher exact test 0.046, Cohen K 0.43, confidence interval 95%, 0.014-0.855).

During two subsequent periods of national lockdown in Italy (JuneCJuly 2020, T1, and NovemberCDecember 2020, T2), a total sample of 47 HCWs working in a reproductive medicine hospital unit completed an ad hoc questionnaire for assessing emotional reactions to the pandemic, stress symptoms, and ways of coping. ModerateChigh levels of anger and sadness were experienced by 65.9% and 68.1% of the HCWs, respectively, while moderateChigh levels of anxiety and fear were experienced by 51.1% and 56.8%, respectively. Higher stress symptoms experienced by HCWs were hypervigilance, avoidance of thoughts and memories, and tiredness/low energy. At T2, levels of hypervigilance, irritability, intrusive thoughts, and detachment were higher than at T1, while avoidance of external triggers decreased. ModerateChigh levels of anxiety resulted significantly associated with several symptoms of stress: irritability/fearfulness, depression/hopelessness, tiredness/low energy, problems with concentration, and intrusive thoughts. Regarding coping strategies, HCWs tended to adopt more problem-focused coping (e.g., contributing to improving a situation) and this tendency was higher at T2. Overall findings suggest a risk for the persistence of stress symptoms and, therefore, a risk for a chronic course, which might interfere with the global quality of mental health at work and the care provided to patients.

The results often largely depend on the approach used to value mortality risk reductions, typically expressed as the value per statistical life (VSL). Many analyses rely on a population-average VSL estimate; some adjust VSL for life expectancy at the age of death. We explore the implications of theory and empirical studies, which suggest that the relationship between age and VSL is uncertain. We compare the effects of three approaches: (1) an invariant population-average VSL; (2) a constant value per statistical life-year (VSLY); and (3) a VSL that follows an inverse-U pattern, peaking in middle age. We find that when applied to the U.S. age distribution of COVID-19 deaths, these approaches result in average VSL estimates of $10.63 million, $4.47 million, and $8.31 million. We explore the extent to which applying these estimates alters the conclusions of frequently cited analyses of social distancing, finding that they significantly affect the findings. However, these analyses do not address other characteristics of COVID-19 deaths that may increase or decrease the VSL estimates. Examples include the health status and income level of those affected, the size of the risk change, and the extent to which the risk is dreaded, uncertain, involuntarily incurred, and outside of one's control. The effects of these characteristics and their correlation with age are uncertain; it is unclear whether they amplify or diminish the effects of age on VSL.","output":"Do the Benefits of COVID-19 Policies Exceed the Costs?

Here we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host.

Abstract The infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, mainly causes alterations in the respiratory system. In severely ill patients, the disease often evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome that can predispose patients to a state of hypercoagulability, with thrombosis at both venous and arterial levels. This predisposition presents a multifactorial physiopathology, related to hypoxia as well as to the severe inflammatory process linked to this pathology, including the additional thrombotic factors present in many of the patients. In view of the need to optimise the management of hypercoagulability, the working groups of the Scientific Societies of Anaesthesiology-Resuscitation and Pain Therapy (SEDAR) and of Intensive, Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC) have developed a consensus to establish guidelines for actions to be taken against alterations in haemostasis observed in severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection. These recommendations include prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in these patients, and in the peripartum, management of patients on long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment, bleeding complications in the course of the disease, and the interpretation of general alterations in haemostasis.","output":"Recomendaciones de consenso SEDAR-SEMICYUC sobre el manejo de las alteraciones de la hemostasia en los pacientes graves con infeccin por COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"KEY MESSAGE: Citrus tristeza virus encodes a unique protein, p23, with multiple functional roles that include co-option of the cytoplasmic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to facilitate the viral infectious cycle. ABSTRACT: The genome of citrus tristeza virus (CTV), genus Closterovirus family Closteroviridae, is a single-stranded (+) RNA potentially encoding at least 17 proteins. One (p23), an RNA-binding protein of 209 amino acids with a putative Zn-finger and some basic motifs, displays singular features: (i) it has no homologues in other closteroviruses, (ii) it accumulates mainly in the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, and in plasmodesmata, and (iii) it mediates asymmetric accumulation of CTV RNA strands, intracellular suppression of RNA silencing, induction of some CTV syndromes and enhancement of systemic infection when expressed as a transgene ectopically or in phloem-associated cells in several Citrus spp. Here, a yeast two-hybrid screening of an expression library of Nicotiana benthamiana (a symptomatic experimental host for CTV), identified a transducin/WD40 domain protein and the cytosolic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as potential host interactors with p23. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation corroborated the p23-GAPDH interaction in planta and showed that p23 interacts with itself in the nucleolus, Cajal bodies and plasmodesmata, and with GAPDH in the cytoplasm (forming aggregates) and in plasmodesmata. The latter interaction was preserved in a p23 deletion mutant affecting the C-terminal domain, but not in two others affecting the Zn-finger and one internal basic motif. Virus-induced gene silencing of GAPDH mRNA resulted in a decrease of CTV titer as revealed by real-time RT-quantitative PCR and RNA gel-blot hybridization. Thus, like other viruses, CTV seems to co-opt GAPDH, via interaction with p23, to facilitate its infectious cycle.","output":"Citrus tristeza virus co-opts glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase for its infectious cycle by interacting with the viral-encoded protein p23"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood-derived biomarkers for brain and spinal cord diseases are urgently needed. The introduction of highly sensitive immunoassays led to a rapid increase in the number of potential blood-derived biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders. In 2018, the FDA authorized a blood test for clinical use in the evaluation of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). The test measures levels of the astrocytic intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuroaxonal marker ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1. In TBI, blood GFAP levels are correlated with clinical severity and extent of intracranial pathology. Evidence also indicates that blood GFAP levels hold the potential to reflect, and might enable prediction of, worsening of disability in individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis. A growing body of evidence suggests that blood GFAP levels can be used to detect even subtle injury to the CNS. Most importantly, the successful completion of the ongoing validation of point-of-care platforms for blood GFAP might ameliorate the decision algorithms for acute neurological diseases, such as TBI and stroke, with important economic implications. In this Review, we provide a systematic overview of the evidence regarding the utility of blood GFAP as a biomarker in neurological diseases. We propose a model for GFAP concentration dynamics in different conditions and discuss the limitations that hamper the widespread use of GFAP in the clinical setting. In our opinion, the clinical use of blood GFAP measurements has the potential to contribute to accelerated diagnosis and improved prognostication, and represents an important step forward in the era of precision medicine.","output":"Blood GFAP as an emerging biomarker in brain and spinal cord disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"n/a.","output":"100 years of insulin: progress, current perspectives and future challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background One of the main aims of the project Peer education as a tool to reach and involve families and schools in the promotion of healthy lifestyles of children' - funded by the Italian Ministry of Health - is the web & social media (SM) content analysis relating to children's eating habits, physical activity and sedentary behaviours.

This studys objective was to develop and evaluate enteric virus concentration protocols for high solids content samples. Two existing protocols were modified and tested using poliovirus type 1 (PV1) seeded into primary sludge. Method 1 (M1) utilized acid adsorption, followed by 2 or 3 elutions (glycine/sodium chloride and/or threonine/sodium chloride), and skimmed milk flocculation. Method 2 (M2) began with centrifugation. The liquid fraction was filtered through a ViroCap filter and eluted (beef extract/glycine). The solid fraction was eluted (beef extract/disodium hydrogen phosphate/citric acid) and concentrated by skimmed milk flocculation. Recovery was enumerated by plaque assay. M1 yielded higher PV1 recovery than M2, though this result was not statistically significant (26.1% and 15.9%, respectively).

This study aimed to develop a hearing-impaired version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (HI-ACE-III) and to assess whether the HI-ACE-III can accurately distinguish people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia from cognitively intact controls. METHODS The HI-ACE-III was developed by converting verbal instructions into a visual, timed PowerPoint presentation. 74 participants over the age of 60 were classified into three groups: 29 had MCI, 15 had mild to moderate dementia and 30 cognitively intact controls. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were graphed to test screening accuracy. Concurrent validity was examined through correlations between HI-ACE-III domain scores and relevant, visually presented standardised neuropsychological measures. RESULTS ROC analysis for dementia revealed an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.99, achieving excellent sensitivity (100%) and good specificity (93.3%) at an optimum cut-off of <87. The AUC for MCI was 0.86, achieving reasonable sensitivity (75.9%) and good specificity (86.7%) at an optimum cut-off of <92. HI-ACE-III subtests shared anticipated and statistically significant correlations with established measures of cognitive functioning. Internal consistency of the HI-ACE-III was excellent as verified with Cronbach's alpha ( = .904). CONCLUSION Preliminarily, the HI-ACE-III showed good reliability, validity and screening utility for MCI and dementia in older adults in a hearing-impairment context.

The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has invested US $386 million in comparative effectiveness research in telehealth, yet little is known about the key early lessons garnered from this research regarding the best practices in using telehealth to address disparities. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes preliminary lessons from the body of research using study findings and case studies drawn from PCORI seminal patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) initiatives. The primary purpose was to identify common barriers and facilitators to implementing telehealth technologies in populations at risk for disparities. METHODS: A systematic scoping review of telehealth studies addressing disparities was performed. It was guided by the Arksey and OMalley Scoping Review Framework and focused on PCORIs active portfolio of telehealth studies and key PCOR identified by study investigators. We drew on this broad literature using illustrative examples from early PCOR experience and published literature to assess barriers and facilitators to implementing telehealth in populations at risk for disparities, using the active implementation framework to extract data. Major themes regarding how telehealth interventions can overcome barriers to telehealth adoption and implementation were identified through this review using an iterative Delphi process to achieve consensus among the PCORI investigators participating in the study. RESULTS: PCORI has funded 89 comparative effectiveness studies in telehealth, of which 41 assessed the use of telehealth to improve outcomes for populations at risk for health disparities. These 41 studies employed various overlapping modalities including mobile devices (29/41, 71%), web-based interventions (30/41, 73%), real-time videoconferencing (15/41, 37%), remote patient monitoring (8/41, 20%), and store-and-forward (ie, asynchronous electronic transmission) interventions (4/41, 10%). The studies targeted one or more of PCORIs priority populations, including racial and ethnic minorities (31/41, 41%), people living in rural areas, and those with low income/low socioeconomic status, low health literacy, or disabilities. Major themes identified across these studies included the importance of patient-centered design, cultural tailoring of telehealth solutions, delivering telehealth through trusted intermediaries, partnering with payers to expand telehealth reimbursement, and ensuring confidential sharing of private information. CONCLUSIONS: Early PCOR evidence suggests that the most effective health system- and provider-level telehealth implementation solutions to address disparities employ patient-centered and culturally tailored telehealth solutions whose development is actively guided by the patients themselves to meet the needs of specific communities and populations. Further, this evidence shows that the best practices in telehealth implementation include delivery of telehealth through trusted intermediaries, close partnership with payers to facilitate reimbursement and sustainability, and safeguards to ensure patient-guided confidential sharing of personal health information.","output":"Early Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Experience With the Use of Telehealth to Address Disparities: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Common marmosets are highly susceptible to several viral pathogens that exist as latent or subclinical infections in their natural reservoir hosts but cause severe disease or death when interspecies transmission occurs.

To shed light on the mechanisms underlying neuronal-type Nos expression, we focused on two non-vertebrate chordates: the cephalochordate Branchiostoma lanceolatum and the tunicate Ciona robusta. Here, throughout transphyletic and transgenic approaches, we identified genomic regions in both species acting as Nos functional enhancers during development. In vivo analyses of Nos genomic fragments revealed their ability to recapitulate the endogenous expression territories.

Insufficient involvement of caregivers in this digitalization process results in poorly integrated technological developments along with a lack of technology acceptance. Therefore, in order to lay a firm foundation for successful technology development, it is utmost essential to understand the intention of professionals to use technology in outpatient care. This paper develops a model that outlines the factors influencing the intention of caregivers to use digital technologies in outpatient care, based on a case study examining the introduction of a textile sensor mat. In the developed model, the care situation is investigated for the first time as a factor influencing the intention to use digital technologies, in addition to technology acceptance. Apart from deriving the factors of the model and inspecting the strength of their influences, the practical relevance for technology developers in other care contexts is also determined. Practical Relevance: Demographic change in the German population is leading to major challenges in various sectors.

Several comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and aging, have been associated with an increase in baseline oxidative stress, likely explaining why such individuals at risk for poor outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, the concept of oxidative stress remains one of the best supported theories to explain the mechanism behind aging. Oxidative stress through both endogenous and exogenous sources has known deleterious effects in both aging and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we will review the role of oxidative stress as a key player in both aging and COVID-19 and highlight why some individuals may have better or poorer outcomes because of this.

Predictive modeling of an emerging disease is challenging due to limited knowledge on its epidemiological characteristics. For COVID-19, the prediction difficulty was further compounded by continuously changing policies, varying behavioral responses, poor availability and quality of crucial datasets, and the variable influence of different factors as the pandemic progresses. Due to these challenges, predictive modeling for COVID-19 has earned a mixed track record. Methods We provide a systematic review of prospective, data-driven modeling studies on population-level dynamics of COVID-19 in the US and conduct a quantitative assessment on crucial elements of modeling, with a focus on the aspects of modeling that are critical to make them useful for decision-makers. For each study, we documented the forecasting window, methodology, prediction target, datasets used, geographic resolution, whether they expressed quantitative uncertainty, the type of performance evaluation, and stated limitations. We present statistics for each category and discuss their distribution across the set of studies considered. We also address differences in these model features based on fields of study. Findings Our initial search yielded 2,420 papers, of which 119 published papers and 17 preprints were included after screening. The most common datasets relied upon for COVID-19 modeling were counts of cases (93%) and deaths (62%), followed by mobility (26%), demographics (25%), hospitalizations (12%), and policy (12%). Our set of papers contained a roughly equal number of short-term (46%) and long-term (60%) predictions (defined as a prediction horizon longer than 4 weeks) and statistical (43%) versus compartmental (47%) methodologies. The target variables used were predominantly cases (89%), deaths (52%), hospitalizations (10%), and R_t (9%). We found that half of the papers in our analysis did not express quantitative uncertainty (50%). Among short-term prediction models, which can be fairly evaluated against truth data, 25% did not conduct any performance evaluation, and most papers were not evaluated over a timespan that includes varying epidemiological dynamics. The main categories of limitations stated by authors were disregarded factors (39%), data quality (28%), unknowable factors (26%), limitations specific to the methods used (22%), data availability (16%), and limited generalizability (8%). 36% of papers did not list any limitations in their discussion or conclusion section. Interpretation Published COVID-19 models were found to be consistently lacking in some of the most important elements required for usability and translation, namely transparency, expressing uncertainty, performance evaluation, stating limitations, and communicating appropriate interpretations. Adopting the EPIFORGE 2020 guidelines would address these shortcomings and improve the consistency, reproducibility, comparability, and quality of epidemic forecasting reporting. We also discovered that most of the operational models that have been used in real-time to inform decision-making have not yet made it into the published literature, which highlights that the current publication system is not suited to the rapid information-sharing needs of outbreaks. Furthermore, data quality was identified to be one of the most important drivers of model performance, and a consistent limitation noted by the modeling community. The US public health infrastructure was not equipped to provide timely, high-quality COVID-19 data, which is required for effective modeling.

A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever. During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We examined the characteristics of these patients. METHODS: A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 42.24  18.32 years visited the general and emergency department of the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University because of endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020. Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, sex, age, and systemic disease history. Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiologic investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, an endodontic diagnosis was determined for the offending tooth, and a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels. RESULTS: Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment. No patients had a fever (>37.2C). One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery. Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with a mean age of 62.42  13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases. The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%), and patients of this group showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6- to 19-year age group and the 20- to 34-year age group (P < .05). The majority of endodontic emergency diagnoses were diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%). Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, and acute apical abscess showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score than that of other groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high-risk area than normally. Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases.

By using 3 distinct cell systems-CHO cells lacking expression of alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin, HeLa cells treated with siRNA to alpha(5)-integrin, and mouse beta(1)-integrin knockout fibroblasts, we show that alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin is required for efficient infection by pseudovirions bearing the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP). These integrins are necessary for viral entry but not for binding or internalization. Given the need for endosomal cathepsins B and L (CatB and CatL) to prime GPs for fusion, we investigated the status of CatB and CatL in integrin-positive and integrin-negative cell lines. Alpha(5)beta(1)-Integrin-deficient cells lacked the double-chain (DC) forms of CatB and CatL, and this correlated with decreased CatL activity in integrin-negative CHO cells. These data indicate that alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin-negative cells may be refractory to infection by GP pseudovirions because they lack the necessary priming machinery (the double-chain forms of CatB and CatL). In support of this model, we show that GP pseudovirions that have been preprimed in vitro to generate the 19-kDa form of GP overcome the requirement for alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin for infection. These results provide further support for the requirement for endosomal cathepsins for ebolavirus infection, identify the DC forms of these cathepsins as previously unrecognized factors that contribute to cell tropism of this virus, and reveal a previously undescribed role for integrins during viral entry as regulators of endosomal cathepsins, which are required to prime the entry proteins of ebolavirus and other pathogenic viruses.","output":"Alpha5beta1-integrin controls ebolavirus entry by regulating endosomal cathepsins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of plants used in the formulations of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which were also used in clinical trials to treat patients with the novel coronavirus COVID-19, and to assess their effects on the cardiovascular system.

The emergence of two dangerous human pathogens from this group along with previous studies illustrating the potential of other subgroup 2b members to transmit to humans has underscored the need for antiviral development against them.

Psychoeducational intervention via a website could be effective for primary prevention of mental illness among workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the effect of a newly developed online psychoeducational website named Imacoco Care on reducing psychological distress and fear about COVID-19 infection among workers. METHODS: Participants in the study were recruited from registered members of a web survey company in Japan. Participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group were invited to access the Imacoco Care program within a month after the baseline survey. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) scores were obtained at baseline and at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. RESULTS: A total of 1200 workers were randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups (n=600 [50%] per group). The Imacoco Care intervention group showed a significant favorable effect on K6 scores (P=.03) with a small effect size (ES; Cohen d=C0.14) and an adverse effect on FCV-19S scores (P=.01) with a small ES (Cohen d=0.16) at 3-month follow-up. In the per protocol analysis (including only participants who had read the Imacoco Care content at least 1 time), the Imacoco Care intervention group also showed a significant favorable effect on reducing K6 scores (P=.03), while an adverse effect on FCV-19S scores was not significant (P=.06) in the intervention group at 3-month follow-up.

However, it is unclear why these people are prone to developing alveolar pneumonia, rapid exacerbations, and death. Therefore, we hypothesized that people with comorbidities may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more vulnerable to various factors; for example, they are likely to become more severely ill when infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To test this hypothesis, we searched the literature extensively. Polymorphisms of genes, such as those that encode angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1), have been associated with numerous comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, and there are potential mechanisms to explain these associations (e.g., -type carriers have greater ACE1 activity, and patients with a genetic alpha-1 anti-trypsin (AAT) deficiency lack control over inflammatory mediators). Since comorbidities are associated with chronic inflammation and are closely related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), these individuals may already have a mild ACE1/ACE2 imbalance before viral infection, which increases their risk for developing severe cases of COVID-19. However, there is still much debate about the association between ACE1 D/I polymorphism and comorbidities. The best explanation for this discrepancy could be that the D allele and  subtypes are associated with comorbidities, but the  genotype alone does not have an exceptionally large effect. This is also expected since the ACE1 D/I polymorphism is only an intron marker. We also discuss how polymorphisms of AAT and other genes are involved in comorbidities and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presumably, a combination of multiple genes and non-genetic factors is involved in the establishment of comorbidities and aggravation of COVID-19.","output":"Does Genetic Predisposition Contribute to the Exacerbation of COVID-19 Symptoms in Individuals with Comorbidities and Explain the Huge Mortality Disparity between the East and the West?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing availability of online content these days raises several questions about effective access to information.

It is characterised by a state of persistent fever, inflammation and organ dysfunction following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. It shares similar clinical features to Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome and macrophage activation syndrome. Like adult COVID-19 infection, profound inflammatory response significantly increases the risk of thromboembolism, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In this review we share our experience, observation and prevention strategy with regard to thromboembolism in PIMS-TS. Method: Between the period of 14th March 2020 to 31st May 2020, Evelina London Children's Hospital admitted 68 patients with PIMS-TS from the South Thames Network. Patients were broadly treated with a combination of high dose aspirin and immunomodulation in the initial period. Realising its pro-thrombotic potential, from 1st May 2020, treatment strategy was changed to incorporate prophylactic subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin 100units/kg once daily) in combination with low dose aspirin (5mg/kg once daily, maximum 75mg) when a working diagnosis of PIMS-TS was made. We retrospectively collected data to understand the prevalence and pattern of thromboembolism in this cohort of patients. Results: Five patients (7.4%) developed thromboembolic complications during their acute illness with 6 recorded events overall. (Table 1) Three events happened without prophylactic anticoagulation cover. Four (5.9%) were cardiovascular/arterial events and 2 (2.9%) were venous thromboembolism. Those who required ventilation support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were associated with higher thrombotic rate using 2-tailed Fisher's exact test (ventilation: p=0.02; ECMO: p=0.004). One ischaemic cerebrovascular event resulted in death. Two bleeding events were recorded whilst on anticoagulation. One was iatrogenic following arterial line insertion and another a haemorrhagic transformation from an ischaemic stroke. Coagulation markers (fibrinogen and D-dimer) followed the overall pattern observed in inflammatory markers (ferritin and C-reactive protein) on admission, at peak values and at 2-week follow up, suggesting a connection between the degree of inflammation and hypercoagulability and inferring immunothrombosis. (Table 2) Peak ferritin and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the group with thromboembolism using 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test (ferritin: p=0.038; D-dimer: p=0.034). Conclusion: Thromboembolism needs to be considered as a significant complication in patients with a diagnosis of PIMS-TS. We observed more cardiovascular/arterial events than venous events, which coincided with the fact that PIMS-TS patients commonly develop cardiac involvement and coronary abnormalities. In addition to rapid correction of hyper-inflammatory state using immunomodulation, we suggest the consideration of low dose aspirin (5mg/kg once daily, maximum 75mg) and prophylactic dalteparin (100units/kg once daily) to prevent both arterial and venous thrombosis after careful individual assessment and exclusion of co-existing factors that can cause increased bleeding risk. This may be especially relevant in those with already raised ferritin and D-dimer levels on admission.

The aims of this study were (1) to estimate the extent to which perceptions and expectations regarding the social, economic, and domestic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are associated with psychological distress and (2) to identify some demographic, psychosocial, and economic factors associated with increased vulnerability to psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chile. 1078 people participated in a telephone survey between May 30 and June 10, 2020. The sample is representative of the Chilean adult population. Psychological distress was assessed through a questionnaire of anxious and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4). We analyzed the data set using ordinary least-squares regression models, first estimating models for the entire sample, and then stratifying the sample into different groups to explore differences by gender and age. 19.2% of participants displayed significant psychological distress (PHQ-4 >= 6), with moderate to severe anxiety-depression symptoms being more prevalent in women than in men (23.9% vs 14.1%, chi2 16.78, p < 0.001). The results of this study suggest that being a woman, feeling lonely and isolated, living in the areas hit hardest by the pandemic and lockdown, expecting a lack of income due to having to stop working as a consequence of the pandemic, and having a history of diagnosed mental disorders are significantly associated with psychological distress (p < 0.05).

Here we generated a series of deuterated variants of a 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376, and evaluated the antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. The deuterated GC376 displayed potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the enzyme and the cell-based assays. The K18-hACE2 mice develop mild to lethal infection commensurate with SARS-CoV-2 challenge doses and was proposed as a model for efficacy testing of antiviral agents. We treated lethally infected mice with a deuterated derivative of GC376. Treatment of K18-hACE2 mice at 24 hr post infection with a derivative (compound 2) resulted in increased survival of mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Lung virus titers were decreased, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in compound 2-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Structural investigation using high-resolution crystallography illuminated binding interactions of 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with deuterated variants of GC376.

We measured the time from admission to mobilization and other clinical characteristics for 190 heart failure patients (mean age, 80.7 years). The primary outcome was heart failure rehospitalization. KaplanCMeier survival curves were plotted and the hazard ratios for rehospitalization were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. During a median follow-up period of 750 days, 58 patients underwent rehospitalization. The time from admission to mobilization was significantly longer for these patients than for those who were not rehospitalized. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that the time from admission to mobilization was an independent predictor of rehospitalization, and receiver-operating characteristic analysis determined an optimal cutoff value of 3 days for differentiating the patients more likely to experience a subsequent cardiac event (sensitivity, 76%; specificity, 69%; area under the curve, 0.667). KaplanCMeier survival curve analysis showed a significantly lower event rate in the  3-day group (p = 0.001, log-rank test). In conclusion, the time from admission to mobilization may be one of the strongest predictors of rehospitalization in elderly heart failure patients.

While elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have been observed in non-specific PASC, little is known about their impact on pulmonary function which is compromised in the majority of these individuals. This study compares frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and inflammatory markers with lung function in participants with pulmonary PASC and resolved COVID-19 (RC). Compared to RC, participants with respiratory PASC had between 6- and 105-fold higher frequencies of IFN-- and TNF--producing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood, and elevated levels of plasma CRP and IL-6. Importantly, in PASC participants the frequency of TNF--producing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which exhibited the highest levels of Ki67 indicating they were activity dividing, correlated positively with plasma IL-6 and negatively with measures of lung function, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), while increased frequencies of IFN--producing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associated with prolonged dyspnea. Statistical analyses stratified by age, number of comorbidities and hospitalization status demonstrated that none of these factors affect differences in the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 T cells and plasma IL-6 levels measured between PASC and RC cohorts. Taken together, these findings demonstrate elevated frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in individuals with pulmonary PASC are associated with increased systemic inflammation and decreased lung function, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells contribute to lingering pulmonary symptoms. These findings also provide mechanistic insight on the pathophysiology of PASC that can inform development of potential treatments to reduce symptom burden.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associate with inflammation and reduced lung function in pulmonary post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Being detained in jail is an acknowledged risk factor for physical and psychiatric morbidity The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the penitentiary system, already characterized by criticalities in terms of healthcare, including high infectious risk, has been considered a source of further danger within the prison and for the community This problem has been raised by several observers, in the absence of a shared approach between states The Italian Government enacted a series of measures aimed at penitentiary structures, to contain and manage health and safety risks General precautions for infections prevention have been used, including frequent hands washing and environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures Physical distancing in jail is extremely chal-lenging, and we deem that it was still impossible to apply it, despite the release of almost 8000 detainees, among those at greater health risk Measures have been also ordered to limit external contacts with detainees, including a substantial or absolute sus-pension of visits from relatives, operators and lawyers, replaced by video meetings Quarantine and isolation of suspect cases has also been ordered, including new prisoners Despite unfavorable premises the analysis we did on available data indicates lower infection rate and lethality rate in prison than in general population In this paper a synthetic framework of the sanitary problems in detention will be provided, then the data will be analyzed, providing possible interpretations potentially useful for the management of the pandemic at the community level Infectious surveillance, compliance with sanitation standards, early treatment of suspected cases, lower mean age, efficacious isolation and quarantine strategies may explain the better outcomes in Italian penitentiary system, also in the impossibility to systematically apply physical distancing ?

Initially a factor analysis was conducted, organising variables into five factors. A discriminant analysis, performed with the five factors, allowed discriminating firms based on whether they internationalise or not. A linear regression was performed in order to estimate the contribution of each factor in the business performance. Findings The results suggest the existence of additional variables for measuring the complexity. From the factorial analysis it is possible to conclude that business complexity can be explained by size, indebtedness and profitability, internationalisation, number of employees, and age and leverage. Total assets, indebtedness and age are the variables that contribute the most to business performance. On the other hand, indebtedness, internationalisation, age and leverage are the independent variables that most contribute to explain business performance.

Later the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) invited SIAARTI and the Italian Society of Legal and Insurance Medicine to prepare a draft document for the definition of triage criteria for intensive care during the emergency, to be implemented in case of complete saturation of care resources. METHODS: Following formal methods, including two Delphi rounds, a multidisciplinary group with expertise in intensive care, legal medicine and law developed 12 statements addressing: (1) principles and responsibilities; (2) triage; (3) previously expressed wishes; (4) reassessment and shifting to palliative care; (5) collegiality and transparency of decisions. The draft of the statements, with their explanatory comments, underwent a public consultation opened to Italian scientific or technical-professional societies and other stakeholders (i.e., associations of citizens, patients and caregivers; religious communities; industry; public institutions; universities and research institutes). Individual healthcare providers, lay people, or other associations could address their comments by e-mail. RESULTS: Eight stakeholders (including scientific societies, ethics organizations, and a religious community), and 8 individuals (including medical experts, ethicists and an association) participated to the public consultation. The stakeholders agreement with statements was on average very high (ranging from 4.1 to 4.9, on a scale from 1full disagreement to 5full agreement). The 4 statements concerning triage stated that in case of saturation of care resources, the intensive care triage had to be oriented to ensuring life-sustaining treatments to as many patients as possible who could benefit from them. The decision should follow full assessment of each patient, taking into account comorbidities, previous functional status and frailty, current clinical condition, likely impact of intensive treatment, and the patient's wishes. Age should be considered as part of the global assessment of the patient.

With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (&#945;,?,?3,?), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under &#945;-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and ?-CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a ?-CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3' end of the genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.","output":"Properties of Coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To establish whether physical health monitoring for CYP on ADHD medication is according to NICE guidance (2018). To determine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on physical health monitoring for CYP on ADHD medication. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity, directly impacting on academic, occupational, or social functioning. It affects between 1-5% of children and young people (CYP) most often presenting in early-mid childhood. Pharmacological treatment can be considered in CYP if certain criteria are met, where licensed medications include methylphenidate, dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine, atomoxetine and guanfacine. Stimulant and non-stimulant medications require frequent physical health monitoring due to their side effects including an increase in blood pressure and/or heart rate, loss of appetite, growth restriction and tics. METHOD: Standards and criteria were derived from the NICE guidance (2018), whilst local trust policies were reviewed, demonstrating discrepancies. Standards were expected to be met for 100% of patients. Electronic patient records were reviewed retrospectively from a representative cohort of CYP reviewed by clinicians in a community CAMHS service during March-November 2020. Data were entered manually into a spreadsheet for evaluation. RESULT: A total of 27 CYP records were reviewed, average age 13yo, on a range of stimulant/non-stimulant preparations. 5 (19%) had height checked every 6 months, with 4 delayed to 7-8 months. For those >10yo, only 5 (19%) had weight checked every 6 months. Only 2 (7%) had their height and weight plotted on a growth chart and reviewed by the healthcare professional responsible for treatment. Just 4 (15%) had heart rate and blood pressure recorded before and after each dose change, whilst similarly only 4 (not the same) had these parameters recorded every 6 months. 17 patients were reviewed by telephone/video call, where 5 patients provided physical health parameters (measured at home). CONCLUSION: Across all parameters, standards are not being met for the required physical health monitoring for CYP on ADHD medication. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the working conditions for community teams, impacting face to face reviews, creating challenges for physical health monitoring. Our ongoing implementations for change include the use of a proforma for physical health measurements, improving psychoeducation for families, exploring potential barriers with senior colleagues and collaborating with pharmacy colleagues to update local guidelines in accordance with the latest NICE recommendations.

Family caregiver training delivered by HHC clinicians (nurses and physical therapists [PTs]) helps ensure caregivers' ability to safely assist when HHC staff are not present. Yet, family caregiver training needs often go unmet during HHC, increasing the risk of adverse patient outcomes. There is a critical knowledge gap regarding challenges HHC clinicians face in providing necessary family caregiver training. METHODS: Multisite qualitative study using semi-structured, in-depth key informant interviews with Registered Nurses (n = 11) and PTs (n = 8) employed by four HHC agencies. Participating agencies were diverse in rurality, scale, ownership, and geographic region. Key informant interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using directed content analysis to identify existing facilitators and barriers to family caregiver training during HHC. RESULTS: Clinicians had an average of 9.3 years (range = 1.5-23 years) experience in HHC, an average age of 45.1 years (range = 28-63 years), and 95% were female. Clinicians identified facilitators and barriers to providing family caregiver training at the individual, interpersonal, and structural levels. The most salient factors included clinician-caregiver communication and rapport, accuracy of hospital discharge information, and access to resources such as additional visits and social work consultation. Clinicians noted the COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional challenges to providing family caregiver training, including caregivers' reduced access to hospital staff prior to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: HHC clinicians identified a range of barriers and facilitators to delivering family caregiver training during HHC; particularly highlighting the role of clinician-caregiver communication. To support caregiver training in this setting, there is a need for updated reimbursement structures supporting greater visit flexibility, improved discharge communication between hospital and HHC, and structured communication aids to facilitate caregiver engagement and assessment.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to family caregiver training during home health care: A multisite qualitative analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contract cheating remains a significant problem for universities and higher education (HE) generally, both within Australia and internationally.

Pearson chi-square tests were used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents attitudes toward child health care at home. RESULTS: A total of 254 parents enrolled, and 202 (79.5%) parents were willing to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents age (26-35 years: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 8.114, 95% CI 1.471-44.764), parents interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (moderate: AOR 8.753, 95% CI 2.009-38.127; high: AOR 22.194, 95% CI 5.509-89.411), the source that recommended mHealth (medical health providers: AOR 4.257, 95% CI 1.439-12.596), the presence of chronic disease in their children (yes: AOR 20.844, 95% CI 4.600-94.443), parents duration of daily internet use (4-6 hours: AOR 6.487, 95% CI 1.870-22.495; >6 hours: AOR 8.766, 95% CI 1.883-40.804), and adoption of mHealth before the COVID-19 outbreak (yes: AOR 3.413, 95% CI 1.234-9.444) were significantly correlated with the parents willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regard to handwashing ((2)(6)=18.967, P=.004), mask wearing ((2)(6)=45.364, P<.001), frequency of leaving the home ((2)(6)=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation ((2)(6)=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking ((2)(6)=17.47, P=.007), and mental health care of children ((2)(6)=63.810, P<.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We found various objective factors that were associated with parents willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, parents willingness to adopt mHealth was high. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their attitudes toward child health care at home. The option of mHealth to patients at home during the COVID-19 outbreak would be beneficial for education and improvement in self-management of child health care at home.","output":"Willingness to Adopt mHealth Among Chinese Parents During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 49-year-old Japanese male was managed by mechanical ventilation due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.

This study assesses its efficacy in patients admitted to critical care following cardiovascular surgery and the influence of standard antithrombotic agents routinely used in this specific group. METHODS Consecutive cardiovascular surgery patients treated with post-dilution hemofiltration with RCA were included in this prospective observational study. The primary outcome of the study was CRRT circuit life-span adjusted for reasons other than clotting. The secondary outcome evaluated the influence of standard antithrombotic agents (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] or fondaparinux as thromboprophylaxis or treatment dose with or without ASA) on filter life. RESULTS Fifty-two patients underwent 193 sessions of CVVH, after exclusion of 15 sessions where unfractionated heparin was administered. The median filter life span was 58 hours. Filter life span was significantly longer in patients receiving therapeutic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (79 h [2-110]), in comparison to patients treated with prophylactic dose of LMWH or fondaparinux (51 h [7-117], p < 0.001), and patients without antithrombotic prophylaxis (42 h [2-91], p < 0.0001). 12 bleeding episodes were observed; 8 occurred in patients receiving treatment dose anticoagulation, 3 in patients receiving prophylactic dose anticoagulation and 1 in a patient with no antithrombotic prophylaxis.

It is believed that BE is caused by chronic gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery (LARS) restores the competency of the cardia and may thereby change the natural course of BE. We studied the impact of LARS on the histological profile of BE and on the control of GERD. METHODS We identified all patients with BE who underwent LARS from 1994 to 2007 and contacted them to assess post-operative GERD symptoms via questionnaire. Endoscopy findings, histology, 24 hour pH monitoring, and manometry were also collected using our prospectively maintained database. Histological regression was defined as either loss of dysplasia or disappearance of BE. RESULTS Two hundred and fifteen patients met the initial inclusion criteria; in 82 of them histology from post-operative endoscopy was available for review. Endoscopy was performed a median of 8 years (range, 1-16 years) after surgery. Regression of BE occurred in 18 (22%) patients while in 6 (7%) BE progressed to dysplasia or cancer. Thirty-six (43%) patients underwent pre- and post-operative manometry. The median lower esophageal sphincter pressure increased from 9 to 17 mmHg in these patients. Thirty-four (41%) patients underwent pre- and post-operative pH studies. The median DeMeester score decreased from 54 to 9. Sixty-seven (82%) of 82 patients completed the post-operative questionnaire; 86% of these patients reported improvement in heartburn and regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS LARS was associated with both physiologic and symptomatic control of GERD in patients with BE. LARS resulted in regression of BE in 22% of patients and progression in 7%.

However, the findings of Phase III clinical trials raise concerns about the efficacy of MSCs, which are rooted mainly in the applied populations heterogeneity. Although several factors, one of the most crucial causes of this heterogeneity is the lack of an optimized cell culture technique to manufacture a homogenous cultured MSCs. Moreover, it is necessary to provide a good manufacturing practice (GMP) platform to ensure the safety of final cell therapy products (CTPs) and satisfy the legal requirements for clinical applications. Establishing a tired cell bank system is the final step to support the proper translation of producing MSCs into medicine by ensuring standardization of the entire cell manufacturing process, accredited identity, function and safety assessments, and transparent sharing of standard operating procedures (SOPs) data. Methods, Results & Conclusion: Here, clonal MSCs (cMSCs) were isolated based on the subfractionation culturing method (SCM) protocol under the GMP-compatible condition and through an innovative, cost-effective screening approach. Then, cMSCs were compared with their heterogeneous counterparts in terms of identity and function. The validated clones were stored in a four-tiered cell bank system consisting of an initial, master, working, and end of product cell banks (ICB, MCB, WCB, and EoPCB). Additionally, to further develop towards GMP- compatible cMSCs production, several identities, quality, and safety assessments were performed during all banking phases. Finally, the cells stored in the EoPCB were released as a drug product (DP) for the Phase I/II clinical trial of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Regarding senescence assessment and capability to serial passaging, three similar passagable clones were manufactured. Remarkably, the clones genomic stability was fully retained after 15 passages and were neither tumorigenic nor immunogenic. Altogether, this study presents a technical and translational overview of GMP-compatible cMSCs manufacturing technology, which could be used as a guide for the development of similar production processes with the therapeutic goals.","output":"Optimization of Gmp-compatible Biobanking of Allogeneic Bone Marrow-derived Clonal Mesenchymal Stromal Cells for Cell Therapy Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maintaining positive mental health can be challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic which undoubtedly caused devastating consequences on people's lives.

The tuberculosis vaccine development pipeline has seen encouraging progress; however, questions around their population impact and implementation remain. Mathematical modelling investigates these questions to inform vaccine development and deployment strategies. We provide an update on the current vaccine development pipeline, and a systematic literature review of mathematical modelling of the epidemiological impact of new tuberculosis vaccines. Fourteen prophylactic tuberculosis vaccine candidates are currently in clinical trials. Two candidates have shown promise in phase II proof-of-concept efficacy trials: M72/AS01E demonstrated 49.7% (95% CI; 2.1, 74.2) protection against tuberculosis disease, and BCG revaccination demonstrated 45.4% (95% CI; 6.4, 68.1) protection against sustained Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Since the last modelling review, new studies have investigated the epidemiological impact of differential vaccine characteristics, age targeting, and spatial/risk group targeting. Critical research priorities for M72/AS01E include completing the currently-in-design trial, powered to improve the precision of efficacy estimates, include uninfected populations, and further assess safety and immunogenicity in HIV-infected people. For BCG revaccination, the priority is completing the ongoing confirmation of efficacy trial. Critical modelling gaps remain on the full value proposition of vaccines, comparisons with other interventions, and more realistic implementation strategies.

Individual factors that modulate pulmonary aging include basic genetic configuration, environmental exposure, life-style and biography of systemic diseases. However, the actual aging of the lung takes place in pulmonary resident cells and is closely linked to aging of the immune system (immunosenescence). Therefore, this article reviews the current knowledge about the impact of aging on pulmonary cells and the immune system, without analyzing those factors that may accelerate the aging process in depth. Hallmarks of aging include alterations at molecular, cellular and cell-cell interaction levels. Because of the great variety of cell types in the lung, the consequences of aging display a broad spectrum of phenotypes. For example, aging is associated with more collagen and less elastin production by fibroblasts, thus increasing pulmonary stiffness and lowering compliance. Decreased sympathetic airway innervation may increase the constriction status of airway smooth muscle cells. Aging of resident and systemic immune cells leads to a pro-inflammatory milieu and reduced capacity of fighting infectious diseases. The current review provides an overview of cellular changes occurring with advancing age in general and in several cell types of the lung as well as of the immune system. Thereby, this survey not only aims at providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of pulmonary aging but also to identify gaps in knowledge that warrant further investigations.","output":"Mechanisms of lung aging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo O presente artigo tem como objetivo analisar as estratgias de interven??o adotadas pela gest?o pblica frente  crise desencadeada pela COVID-19 para redu??o da inseguran?a alimentar, baseado em um estudo de caso no Rio Grande do Norte.

However, multiple recent findings have verified its importance in blocking virus spread. Evidence on the association between mobility, cases imported from abroad and local medical resource supplies is limited. To reveal the association, this study quantified the importance of inter- and intra-country mobility in containing virus spread and avoiding hospitalizations during early stages of COVID-19 outbreaks in India, Japan, and China. We calculated the time-varying reproductive number (Rt) and duration from illness onset to diagnosis confirmation (Doc), to represent conditions of virus spread and hospital bed shortages, respectively. Results showed that inter-country mobility fluctuation could explain 80%, 35%, and 12% of the variance in imported cases and could prevent 20 million, 5 million, and 40 million imported cases in India, Japan and China, respectively. The critical time for screening and monitoring of imported cases is 2 weeks at minimum and 4 weeks at maximum, according to the time when the Pearson's Rs between Rt and imported cases reaches a peak (>0.8). We also found that if local transmission is initiated, a 1% increase in intra-country mobility would result in 1430 (501), 109 (181), and 10 (1) additional bed shortages, as estimated using the Doc in India, Japan, and China, respectively.

Only RCTs that compared the treatment efficacy and safety of tocilizumab with the placebo or the standard of care for adult patients with COVID-19 were included in this meta-analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Results This meta-analysis included eight RCTs which enrolled a total of 6,314 patients for randomization, in which 3,267 and 3,047 patients were assigned to the tocilizumab and control groups, respectively. The mortality at day 28 was 24.4% and 29.9% in patients in the tocilizumab and control groups, respectively, meaning there was no significant difference observed between these two groups (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.66-1.28; I2 = 62). This finding did not change in the subgroup analysis according to the initial use of MV or steroid while enrollment. The patients receiving tocilizumab had a lower rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission at day 28 compared with the control group (MV use: OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.90; I2 = 11; ICU admission: OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.92; I2 = 30).

METHODS Twenty selected patients with rectal cancer were enrolled onto a prospective study of minilaparoscopy-assisted natural orifice surgery TME rectal resection. The study endpoints were safety of access (intra- or postoperative morbidity) and adequacy of oncological resection criteria; intact TME; distal and circumferential margins; and number of lymph nodes retrieved. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed with the transanal NOTES and minilaparoscopy technique. The mean age was 65  10 years; 55% of patients were male; the mean body mass index was 25.3  3.8 kg/m(2). Thirty-five percent of tumors were in the distal rectum, 50% in midrectum, and 15% in proximal rectum. Coloanal anastomoses were hand sewn in 65% and stapled in 35%.

Moreover, numerous studies of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with PD suggest alterations in markers of inflammation and immune cell populations that could initiate or exacerbate neuroinflammation and perpetuate the neurodegenerative process. A number of disease genes and risk factors have been identified as modulators of immune function in PD and evidence is mounting for a role of viral or bacterial exposure, pesticides and alterations in gut microbiota in disease pathogenesis. This has led to the hypothesis that complex gene-by-environment interactions combine with an ageing immune system to create the perfect storm that enables the development and progression of PD.

Results: Compared with the baseline, the SFI of the SNI group and the Tuina group decreased significantly at the 0th intervention (7 days after molding); compared with the SNI group, the SFI of the Tuina group increased at the 10th intervention (P < 0.05) and increased significantly at the 15th and 20th intervention (P < 0.01). Compared with the Sham group, the myelin sheath integrity of the sciatic nerve in the SNI group was destroyed and the myelin sheath collapsed seriously, even forming myelin sheath ball, accompanied with severe axonal atrophy and mitochondrial degeneration. The tuina intervention could significantly improve the ultrastructure of the nerve injury point, and the nerve fiber myelin sheath in the Tuina group remained intact, without obvious axonal swelling or atrophy. Atrophic thread granules could be seen in the axon, but there were no vacuolated mitochondria. RNA-seq results showed that there were differences at 221 genes at the point of nerve injury between the Tuina group and the SNI group and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are enriched in the biological processes related to the regulation of myocyte. Regulations include the regulation of striated muscle cell differentiation, myoblast differentiation, and myotube differentiation. Conclusion: Tuina can improve the fine motor recovery and protect the myelin integrity in rats with peripheral nerve injury, and this is achieved by changing the gene sequence at the injured point.","output":"An Investigation into the Rehabilitative Mechanism of Tuina in the Treatment of Sciatic Nerve Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to public mental health stress, anxiety, panic, and behavioral disorders.

The emerging need for alternative ways to follow these patients up is leading to a wide adoption of telemedicine. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of this approach for our cohort of patients with CTDs, investigating their attitude to adopting telemedicine, even after the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a telephonic survey among consecutive patients referred to our CTD outpatients clinic, evaluating their capability and propensity for adopting telemedicine and whether they would prefer it over face-to-face evaluation. Demographical and occupational factors were also collected, and their influence on the answers has been evaluated by a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients answered our survey (M/F = 28/147), with a median age of 62.5 years [interquartile range (IQR) 53C73]. About 80% of patients owned a device allowing video-calls, and 86% would be able to perform a tele-visit, either alone (50%) or with the help of a relative (36%). Telemedicine was considered acceptable by 78% of patients and 61% would prefer it. Distance from the hospital and patients educational level were the strongest predictive factors for the acceptance of telemedicine (P < 0.05), whereas age only affected the mastering of required skills (P < 0.001).

In order to understand the active form and the substrate specificity of the enzyme, we have cloned, expressed, and purified SARS 3C-like proteinase. Analytic gel filtration shows a mixture of monomer and dimer at a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml and mostly monomer at 0.2 mg/ml, which correspond to the concentration used in the enzyme assays. The linear decrease of the enzymatic-specific activity with the decrease of enzyme concentration revealed that only the dimeric form is active and the dimeric interface could be targeted for structural-based drug design against SARS 3C-like proteinase. By using a high pressure liquid chromatography assay, SARS 3C-like proteinase was shown to cut the 11 peptides covering all of the 11 cleavage sites on the viral polyprotein with different efficiency. The two peptides corresponding to the two self-cleavage sites are the two with highest cleavage efficiency, whereas peptides with non-canonical residues at P2 or P1 positions react slower. The P2 position of the substrates seems to favor large hydrophobic residues. Secondary structure studies for the peptide substrates revealed that substrates with more -sheetlike structure tend to react fast.

Shortly after that, it was reported that mortality rates in New York City (NYC), the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, were found to be significantly higher in African American and Hispanics. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the mortality rates in NYC among the different ethnic groups and the different boroughs as it relates to the obesity rates to see whether this issue merits further evaluation. METHODS: COVID-19 data was obtained from the official New York (NY) authorities in relation to total number of cases in the different boroughs of NYC. Age adjusted COVID-19 related mortality rates of the different ethnic groups were also obtained. This data was cross compared to historic community health data on obesity rates previously published and also obesity rates among the different ethnic groups in NYC. RESULTS: The two NYC boroughs that have the highest mortality rates are The Bronx (6%) and Brooklyn (5.4%). Both The Bronx and Brooklyn were also found to have the highest obesity rates 32% and 27% respectively. The two ethnic groups with the highest obesity rates (Hispanics and African Americans) were also found to have the highest age adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 compared to the other ethnic groups (22.8% and 19.8% respectively). CONCLUSION: Hispanics and African Americans in NYC seem to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic because of the higher incidence of mortality rates.

In situ observations of water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, TAlk, and pH were measured in four different stations of the Hooghly estuary. It was measured once every month during 2015-2016, and subsequently, DIC was estimated. A carbon budget was constructed to quantify carbon flows through the freshwater-marine continuum of the Hooghly estuary, and plausible impacts on the adjacent coastal ocean, the northern Bay of Bengal, were examined. The biogeochemical mass balance box model was used to compute the seasonal flow of carbon flux, and subsequently, the annual budgeting of lateral fluxes of TAlk and DIC to the adjacent coastal ocean was carried out. The net annual TAlk and DIC flux from the Hooghly estuary to the adjacent coastal ocean were 4.45  1.90  1011 mol and 4.59  1.70  1011 mol, respectively. The net annual DIC flux of the Hooghly estuary is about 30 to 60 times higher than surface area integrated air-water CO2 flux, which is an indication of promoting acidification in the adjacent coastal ocean. The present study indicates that the lateral DIC flux has increased substantially in the Hooghly estuary during the last two decades. The increase in inorganic carbon load in the Hooghly estuary due to the enhanced discharge of inorganic and organic matter load in the upper reaches of the estuary led to this increase in lateral DIC flux. The results strongly establish the need of having such regional studies for better understanding the estuarine carbon dynamics, and its role in controlling the adjacent coastal ocean dynamics.","output":"Outwelling of total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon from the Hooghly River to the adjacent coastal Bay of Bengal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this co-autoethnographic qualitative case study was to chronicle the experiences of the first author as he taught general music in a blended, face-to-face, and online synchronous, environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We analyzed ophthalmic consequences due to coverage of the origin of the ophthalmic artery by flow-diverting stents for the treatment of internal carotid artery aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS From April 2009 to April 2013, the clinical and angiographic outcomes of all 28 patients treated for aneurysms with flow-diverting stents covering the origin of the ophthalmic artery were prospectively collected. The origin of the ophthalmic artery in relation to the target aneurysm was classified by using a 4-type classification. A complete ophthalmic examination was performed by a single ophthalmologist 48 hours before and 1 week after covering the ophthalmic artery. RESULTS Ophthalmic artery patency was normal at the end of endovascular treatment in 24/28 cases (85.7%). With extensive ophthalmic examinations, 11 patients (39.3%) showed new ophthalmic complications. Patients with the ophthalmic artery originating from the aneurysm sac were at high risk for retinal emboli (4/5, 80%). Patients with the ophthalmic artery originating from the inner curve of the carotid siphon were at high risk for optic nerve ischemic atrophy (3/4, 75%). CONCLUSIONS This prospective study shows that covering the ophthalmic artery with a flow-diverting stent is not without potential complications. Ophthalmic complications can occur but are often not diagnosed.

Serum Cystatin C (sCysC) and serum Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (sNGAL) are emerging biomarkers for kidney injury, and were suggested to be superior to serum creatinine (sCr) in several clinical settings. Moreover, elevated sCysC is associated with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19. We aimed to assess the utility of sCysC and sNGAL for predicting COVID-19-associated AKI, need for RRT, and need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, when measured at presentation to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: Patients presenting to the ED with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included. The primary outcome was development of COVID-19-associated AKI, while the secondary outcomes were need for RRT and ICU admission. RESULTS: Among 52 COVID-19 patients, 22 (42.3%) developed AKI with 8/22 (36.4%) requiring RRT. Both sCr and sCysC demonstrated excellent performance for predicting AKI (AUC, 0.86 and 0.87, respectively) and need for RRT (AUC, 0.94 and 0.95, respectively). sNGAL displayed acceptable performance for predicting AKI (AUC, 0.81) and need for RRT (AUC, 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: SCr and sCysC measured at ED presentation are both highly accurate predictors of AKI and need for RRT, whereas sNGAL demonstrated adequate diagnostic performance. While sCyC was previously shown to be superior to sCr as a diagnostic biomarker of kidney injury in certain etiologies, our findings demonstrate that sCr is comparable to sCyC in the context of predicting COVID-19-associated AKI. Given the high sensitivity of these biomarkers for predicting the need for RRT, and as sCysC is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients, we recommend their measurement for enabling risk stratification and early intervention.","output":"Early prediction of COVID-19-associated Acute Kidney Injury: Are serum NGAL and serum Cystatin C levels better than serum creatinine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) has established itself as a safe method for the management of pelvic organ prolapse (POP).

However, clusters often require user-defined thresholds and are sensitive to non-epidemiological factors, such as non-random sampling. Consequently the ideal threshold for public health applications varies substantially across settings. Here, we show a method which selects optimal thresholds for phylogenetic (subset tree) clustering based on population. We evaluated this method on HIV-1 pol datasets (n = 14,221 sequences) from four sites in USA (Tennessee, Seattle), Canada (Northern Alberta) and China (Beijing). Clusters were defined by tips descending from an ancestral node (with a minimum bootstrap support of 95%) through a series of branches, each with a length below a given threshold. Next, we used pplacer to graft new cases to the fixed tree by maximum likelihood. We evaluated the effect of varying branch-length thresholds on cluster growth as a count outcome by fitting two Poisson regression models: a null model that predicts growth from cluster size, and an alternative model that includes mean collection date as an additional covariate. The alternative model was favoured by AIC across most thresholds, with optimal (greatest difference in AIC) thresholds ranging 0.007C0.013 across sites. The range of optimal thresholds was more variable when re-sampling 80% of the data by location (IQR 0.008 C 0.016, n = 100 replicates).

The proposals were innovative, since they solved a geometric problem (locating a point in a coordinate system) only by applying concepts of geometry. Among these developed methods, the PPC (Pole-Polar Centroid model) was also presented. Although the PPC solves the problem of locating a device with better precision than conventional methods (based on numerical or optimization methods), its accuracy was found to be the worst among the five proposed geometric methods. In this context, this work proposes an extension to our PPC method, called the weighted Pole-Polar Centroid method (wPPC), which improves the accuracy of the previous PPC results. Such an extension does not change the complexity O(m 2) or the minimum dimensionality (m = 2) of nodes, which integrate a location network to perform the triangulation of such signals. Moreover, this extension estimates a device's location coordinates by means of the interaction, via signals, of this device with the network nodes distributed in any coordinate system. An IEEE 802.11 network infrastructure is used to accomplish the experiments. Errors in signal data are common, and our new proposed method, the wPPC, can mitigate the influence of these errors, produce more accurate results than the PPC, and outperform some of the other four proposed geometric methods and current numeric methods. Despite the use of an IEEE 802.11 network infrastructure for testing here, this range-based method for signal triangulation can be applied to any signal type (such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and light and sound propagation).","output":"New signal location method based on signal-range data for proximity tracing tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individual and population susceptibilities to disease remain a murky area of investigation, clouded by past bias based on ideological differences and wars.

Although all countries are taking varying degrees of measures to curb the dissemination, the virus is still spreading rapidly in all parts of the world. Adherence of people for COVID-19 precaution measures is one of the most important factors which determine the effectiveness of curbing the spread. However, without having a good attitude, the adherence of people toward precaution measures could be challenging. Therefore, this study aims to assess the attitude, practice, and associated factors of Gedeo zone of Southern Ethiopia region residents toward COVID-19 and its prevention. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 600 Gedeo zone residents of Southern Ethiopia. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression were used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. An adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to show the strength of association. P-value<0.05 was used to decide a statistically significant association. RESULTS: Most of the study participants (90.3%) have a good attitude toward COVID-19 and its prevention. Being a younger age group (AOR=3.82, 95% CI=1.76C19.07), having a diploma and above (AOR=2.53, 95% CI=1.15C7.50), having a chronic medical illness (AOR=2.73, 95% CI=1.01C7.44), and using television/radio as a source of information (AOR=2.65, 95% CI=1.27C5.54) were significantly associated with a good attitude toward COVID-19. On the other hand, only 20% of the study participants had good practice toward COVID-19 prevention.

Interviews were conducted with 30 people: 11 on non-refugee temporary visas and 19 on refugee temporary visas. Data was analyzed thematically. Analysis identified experiences of exploitation and discrimination in the Australian labor market that included difficulties securing work, underpayment, overwork, and hazardous workplaces. These experiences had negative health effects, particularly on mental health. None had made a formal complaint about their treatment, citing the precarity of their visas, difficulties finding an alternative job, and lack of knowledge about what to do. The impacts were especially evident for refugees who were also grappling with pre-settlement trauma and ongoing uncertainties about their future protection. Overall, these findings of discrimination and exploitation in the workplace and subsequent ill health highlight the pervasive impact of neoliberal agendas and stress the need for industrial, immigration, and welfare reform to protect workers on temporary visas.","output":"Temporary Refugee and Migration Visas in Australia: An Occupational Health and Safety Hazard."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The chemical cues by which lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) beetles find each other are still unknown.

All components of this synthetic aggregation pheromone lure, including: (R)-(+)-limonene, (E)--ocimene, (S)-(+)-linalool, (R)-(+)-daucene, and 2-nonanone were also tested singly. Chicken dropping volatile compounds and fresh chicken droppings (CD) were evaluated singly or in combination with the pheromone lure. In Arkansas, trapping experiments were conducted in different poultry houses with low, moderate, and high lesser mealworm populations to evaluate the attraction of pheromone lure. Laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassay was found to be a useful and convenient tool for evaluating the attractants before testing them in the poultry house. Greater attraction of adults and larvae to a dose of 20C30 g pheromone lure was identified in laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassays. Adults and larvae were highly attractive to a combination of fresh CD and pheromone lure, whereas, a combination of chicken dropping volatile and pheromone lure was not significantly attractive. The low attraction of limonene and linalool in the laboratory two-choice pitfall bioassays suggest that either they are nonattractive or attractive only at a narrow range of concentrations.

We aimed to identify children and adolescent cases requiring dermatology services and their urgency when the number of COVID-19 cases was rapidly increasing and partial curfews were being imposed in Turkey. METHODS: The study was conducted with pediatric patients that presented to our hospital dermatology outpatient clinic, a tertiary health care institution between March 11, 2020, and May 29, 2020, and their differences according to age groups and presentation period were evaluated. RESULTS: The most common reason for a dermatology clinic visit was acneiform diseases (n=103, 33.3%). According to age groups, the most common diagnosis was eczema diseases in both the 0C2 and 3C6 years groups (n=10 [55.6%] and n=11 [47.8%]), respectively), infectious diseases in the 7C12 years group (n=19, 31.10%), and acneiform diseases in the 13C18 years group (n=100, 48.3%).

Surveys were administered to the healthy volunteers (age 15-60 y) with stay-at-home for a month or more, without previous sleep disorders and mood-related complaints; volunteers were not involved in online education/work daily timetable-related activities. RESULTS: We analyzed 3787 subjects with average stay-at-home of 65  9 days. The most significant changes in sleep occurred during the first ten days when the difference between weekdays and weekends disappeared and changes occurred in napping habits.

Cell-free virions consist of a rod-shaped nucleocapsid (120-150x19-22 nm) similar to that seen in baculoviruses. The virion has a bacilliform shape (170-200x75-88 nm) reminiscent of rhabdoviruses with an envelope containing coronavirus-like spikes (20-25 nm). DF 24/00 replicated well in various fish cell lines. Inhibitor studies with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine indicated that the viral genome consists of RNA and chloroform sensitivity correlated with ultrastructural demonstration of enveloped virions. The buoyant density of the virus determined in sucrose was 1.17-1.19 g/ml. Preliminary biochemical characterization revealed the presence of six antigenic glycoproteins, three of which contain sugars with concanavalin-A specificity. Ultrastructurally, morphogenesis of virus progeny was detected only in the cytoplasm. Nucleocapsids were observed to bud through membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus into dilated vesicles. Egress of mature virions occurs primarily by exocytosis and, only very rarely, by budding directly at the plasma membrane.

Participants' demographics such as age, gender, and vasorin levels were recorded and compared between the patient and control groups. In addition, primary tumor status (pT) values N and T stages of the tumors were studied in the patient group. All patients included in the study were pathologically confirmed by colonoscopy plus biopsy and postoperative histopathologic examination. Results The mean age was found as 64.593.70 (min-max: 55-70) years old in the patient group and 63.563.07 (min-max: 57-70) years.

METHODS: We will conduct two interrelated pragmatic randomized trials in January 2021. One trial will include family physicians in Ontario who have signed up to receive their MyPractice: Primary Care report from Ontario Health (OH Trial). These physicians will be cluster-randomized by practice, 1:1 to intervention or control.

METHODS: Web of Science, PMC/Medline, and Scopus databases were searched until July 2020 without time and language limitations. After quality assessment, 22 articles were included in this study. RESULTS: Based on the results, it is impossible to conclude any definite relationship between the rising or decreasing stroke frequency or the shift in the ischemic and hemorrhagic ratio and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 infection has some correlation with stroke. The supposed mechanisms for the SARS-CoV-2-related hemorrhagic stroke include 1) SARS-CoV-2-related vasculopathy with the endothelial damage of small vessels, 2) viral infection-induced platelet dysfunction or thrombocytopenia, and 3) activation of the proinflammatory cascade leading to coagulopathy. The helpful strategies are receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for high D-dimer or a known thrombus due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in some patients. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms for the SARS-CoV-2-related ischemic stroke include 1) dysregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (a key host cellular receptor for SARSCoV-2)-related physiologic functions, 2) endothelial cell damages, 3) thrombo-inflammation, and 4) coagulopathy and coagulation abnormalities related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The country is known as endemic for malaria and respiratory infections. The main objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SCD; the secondary objective was to evaluate its association with malaria and respiratory infections. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study which was carried out in a rural village in the south east coast of Madagascar between May 2011 and November 2013. Participants were children aged between 2C59 months presenting with fever measured by axillary temperature 37.5 C at inclusion. Genotyping of haemoglobin S was done by PCR and malaria was diagnosed by Rapid Diagnostic Test. Research for viral and atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. Uni-and multivariate polytomous logistic regression was done to assess associations between microbiological results and SCD status, with HbAA phenotype as reference. RESULTS: A total of 807 children were analysed. Prevalence of SCD among febrile children was 2.4% (95% CI, 1.5C3.7%) and that of SCT was 23.8% (95% CI, 20.9C26.9%). There was no difference in the prevalence of malaria infection according to haemoglobin status (p = 0.3). Rhinovirus (22.5%), adenovirus (14.1%), and bocavirus (11.6%) were the most common respiratory pathogens detected. After univariate analysis, patients with SCD were more frequently infected by parechovirus (p = 0.01), while patients with SCT were more prone to RSV A or B infection (p = 0.01). After multivariate analysis, HbAS phenotype was associated with higher risk of RSV A and B infection compared to HbAA (adjusted OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2C3.1, p = 0.009), while HbSS phenotype was associated with higher risk of parechovirus infection (adjusted OR = 6.0; 95% CI: 1.1C31.3, p = 0.03) compared to HbAA, independently of age, gender, period per quarter, and the other viruses.

The incidence of these complications in pregnancy is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of abnormal serum cardiac biomarkers or bradycardia among pregnant and immediately postpartum women admitted for treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 in a large integrated health system in New York. Study Design This is a retrospective review of all pregnant and immediately postpartum women hospitalized for COVID-19 at 7 hospitals within Northwell Health, the largest academic health system in New York state, from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Women who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and who met the National Institute of Health (NIH) criteria for severe or critical illness5 were included. Women with a positive PCR test who were admitted for a reason other than treatment of COVID-19 (eg, labor) were excluded. The Northwell Health Institutional Review Board approved the study as minimal-risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice and waived the requirement for informed consent. Clinical records were manually reviewed. Data collected included demographics, medical comorbidities, pregnancy characteristics, laboratory and imaging results, medications administered, and clinical outcomes. Laboratory and imaging studies were ordered at the discretion of the attending physician. The primary outcomes evaluated were elevated cardiac troponins (I, T, or high sensitivity), elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), bradycardia (defined as < 60 beats per minute, bpm), and maternal heart rate (HR) nadir. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the data. Results A total of 31 women met inclusion criteria; 20 (65%) had cardiac biomarkers measured during hospitalization (Table). Cardiac troponins and BNP were elevated in 22% (n=4/18) and 30% (n=3/10) of these patients, respectively. Four patients had transthoracic echocardiograms performed and all were reported as normal. No patients had preexisting cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Two maternal mortalities in this cohort were previously reported;6 both patients had elevated cardiac troponins and one also had an elevated BNP. The nadir HR ranged from 30-92 bpm and bradycardia occurred in one-third of patients (n=10/31). Half of women with elevated troponin and three-fourths of women with elevated BNP had an episode of bradycardia recorded during their hospital course. Conclusion Myocardial injury as demonstrated by abnormal cardiac biomarkers and bradycardia may be common among pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19. In this study, one-fifth of patients who had troponin levels measured were found to have elevations (one-eighth of the overall study population). Among patients who had brain natriuretic peptide levels measured, 30% were elevated (10% of the overall study population). One third of women had bradycardia. This study is limited by a small sample size. Laboratory testing and imaging was not uniform due to the retrospective nature of the study. Sampling bias was unavoidable because the decision to measure cardiac markers or perform imaging studies was made by the patients care team, based on clinical presentation rather than a formal protocol. Few studies have evaluated the risk of cardiac injury or arrhythmia among pregnant women with COVID-19. It is also unknown whether there are long-term sequelae that affect maternal health or future pregnancy outcomes. This is an important area of focus for future research.","output":"Myocardial injury associated with coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In this study, an infection screening system was developed to detect patients suffering from infectious diseases. In addition, the system was also designed to deal with the variability in age and gender, which would affect the accuracy of the detection. Furthermore, to enable a low-cost, non-contact and embedded system, multiple vital signs from a medical radar were measured and all algorithms were implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array, named PYNQ-Z1. METHODS: The system consisted of two main stages: digital signal processing and data classification. In the former stage, Butterworth filters, with flexible cut-off frequencies depending on age and gender, and a time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to compute three vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and standard deviation of heart beat-to-beat interval. For the classification problem, two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, were implemented. RESULTS: The Student's t-test showed that our proposed digital signal processing algorithms coped well with the variability of human cases in age and gender. Meanwhile, the f(1)-score of roughly 98.0% represented the high sensitivity and specificity of our proposed machine learning methods.

We estimate that the mean number of contacts increased 5%-17% since the end of the lockdown but are still 3-7 times lower than their pre-pandemic levels. We find that post-lockdown contact patterns in China are still sufficiently low to keep SARS-CoV-2 transmission under control. We also find that the impact of school interventions depends non-linearly on the share of other activities being resumed. When most community activities are halted, school closure leads to a 77% decrease in the reproductive number; in contrast, when social mixing outside of schools is at pre-pandemic level, school closure leads to a 5% reduction in transmission.

In this study, we compared the host response to influenza A virus (IAV) infection in susceptible animals (wild-type, WT) to resilient mice (Vimentin-/- mice). We identified distinct gene expression patterns in recruited monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (MoAMs) associated with three phases (Infiltrating, Early Inflammatory, Late Inflammatory) that evolve in sequence over the course of IAV infection. We report a core set of pro-inflammatory genes involved in the WT MoAM Early Inflammatory response that is suppressed in Vim-/- MoAMs. Moreover, we identify CEBPB, Jun-AP1, and IRF transcriptions factors as regulators of this attenuated inflammatory response. We performed causal experiments using bone-marrow chimeras to credential that Vim-/- MoAMs with suppressed pro-inflammatory genes confer protection from influenza-induced mortality in WT susceptible mice. Taken together, these data support the notion that vimentin plays a causal role in determining the pro-inflammatory function of recruited MoAMs and drives IAV-induced lung injury.","output":"Influenza-induced activation of recruited alveolar macrophages during the early inflammatory phase drives lung injury and lethality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. Clinically, respiratory tract symptoms as well as other organs disorders are observed in patients positively diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, neurological symptoms, mainly anosmia, ageusia and headache were observed in many patients. Once in the central nervous system (CNS), the SARS-CoV-2 can reside either in a quiescent latent state, or eventually in actively state leading to severe acute encephalitis, characterized by neuroinflammation and prolonged neuroimmune activation. SRAS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The expression of this receptor in endothelial cells of blood-brain barrier (BBB) shows that SRAS-CoV-2 may have higher neuroinvasive potential compared to known coronaviruses. This review summarizes available information regarding the impact of SRAS-CoV-2 in the brain and tended to identify its potential pathways of neuroinvasion. We offer also an understanding of the long-term impact of latently form of SARS-CoV-2 on the development of neurodegenerative disorders. As a conclusion, the persistent infection of SRAS-CoV-2 in the brain could be involved on human neurodegenerative diseases that evolve a gradual process, perhapes, over several decades.","output":"Does coronaviruses induce neurodegenerative diseases?

A better grip might reduce the failure rates. Material and methods A biomechanical model delivering dynamic intermittent strain (DIS) was used to assess grip values at various hernia orifices. The model consists of a water-filled aluminium cylinder covered with tissues derived from pig bellies which are punched with a central defect varying in diameter. DIS was applied mimicking coughs lasting for up to 2 s with peak pressures between 180 and 220 mmHg and a plateau phase of 0.1 s. Ventral hernia repair was simulated with hernia meshes in the sublay position secured by tacks, glue or sutures as needed to achieve certain grip values. Grip was calculated taking into account the mesh: defect area ratio and the fixation strength. Data were assessed using non-parametric statistics. Results Using a mesh classified as highly stable upon DIS testing (DIS class A) a reduced overlap without fixation led to early slippage (p < 0.001). With the application of 16 fixation points, transmural sutures were better than tacks with Securestrap? being better than Absorbatack? (p < 0.001). Plotting the likelihood of a durable repair as a function of the calculated grip higher grip values were needed with increasing hernia diameter to achieve biomechanical stability. This is important for clinical work since the calculated grip values both from a registry and from published data tend to drop as hernia sizes increase indicating biomechanical instability. Conclusion The experimental work reported here demonstrates for the first time that higher grip values should be reached when repairing larger ventral hernias.","output":"Increasing hernia size requires higher GRIP values for a biomechanically stable ventral hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has overrun hospital systems while exacerbating economic hardship and food insecurity on a global scale. In an effort to understand how early action to find and control the virus is associated with cumulative outcomes, we explored how country-level testing capacity affects later COVID-19 mortality. Methods: We used the Our World in Data database to explore testing and mortality records in 27 countries from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020; we applied ordinary-least squares regression with clustering on country to determine the association between early COVID-19 testing capacity (cumulative tests per case) and later COVID-19 mortality (time to specified mortality thresholds), adjusting for country-level confounders, including median age, GDP, hospital bed capacity, population density, and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Results: Higher early testing implementation, as indicated by more cumulative tests per case when mortality was still low, was associated with longer accrual time for higher per capita deaths. For instance, a higher cumulative number of tests administered per case at the time of 6 deaths per million persons was positively predictive of a longer time to reach 15 deaths per million, after adjustment for all confounders (beta=0.659; P=0.001). Conclusions: Countries that developed stronger COVID-19 testing capacity at early timepoints, as measured by tests administered per case identified, experienced a slower increase of deaths per capita. Thus, this study operationalizes the value of testing and provides empirical evidence that stronger testing capacity at early timepoints is associated with reduced mortality and better pandemic control.","output":"The Association between Early Country-level Testing Capacity and Later COVID-19 Mortality Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the olfactory pathway was studied over several time points using Syrian golden hamsters.

For this purpose, the levels of melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA-5), retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3), TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 mRNAs were evaluated, using TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, in cells from nasopharyngeal washes collected from 157 infants suffering from acute bronchiolitis whether or not they were associated with respiratory viruses. High interindividual variability was observed in both virus-positive and -negative infants; however, the relative gene expression levels of MDA-5, RIG-1, TLR-7, and TLR-8 were significantly higher in the virus-infected group, whereas the expression levels of TLR-3 and TLR-9 were not significantly different. The differences in the gene expression of MDA-5, RIG-1, TLR-7, and TLR-8 were more evident in infants with RSV infection than in those with bocavirus or rhinovirus infection. In RSV-infected infants, PRR-mRNA levels also were analyzed in relation to interferon protein levels, viral load, clinical severity, days of hospitalization, age, and body weight. A significant positive correlation was observed only between RSV viral load and RIG-1 mRNA levels.

Common treatments for SDB include adenotonsillectomy and nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), but adenotonsillectomy is an invasive surgical procedure, and CPAP is rarely well-tolerated. Further, there is no current consensus on the ability of these treatments to improve cognitive function. Several double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of montelukast, a safe, well-tolerated anti-inflammatory agent, as a treatment for airway obstruction and reducing adenoid size for children who do not have SCA. However, we do not yet know whether montelukast reduces adenoid size and improves cognition function in young children with SCA. METHODS: The Study of Montelukast In Children with Sickle Cell Disease (SMILES) is a 12-week multicentre, double-blind, RCT. SMILES aims to recruit 200 paediatric patients with SCA and SDB aged 3C7.99 years to assess the extent to which montelukast can improve cognitive function (i.e. processing speed) and sleep and reduce adenoidal size and white matter damage compared to placebo. Patients will be randomised to either montelukast or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary objective of the SMILES trial is to assess the effect of montelukast on processing speed in young children with SCA. At baseline and post-treatment, we will administer a cognitive evaluation; caregivers will complete questionnaires (e.g. sleep, pain) and measures of demographics. Laboratory values will be obtained from medical records collected as part of standard care. If a family agrees, patients will undergo brain MRIs for adenoid size and other structural and haemodynamic quantitative measures at baseline and post-treatment, and we will obtain overnight oximetry. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will increase our understanding of whether montelukast is an effective treatment for young children with SCA. Using cognitive testing and MRI, the SMILES trial hopes to gain critical knowledge to help develop targeted interventions to improve the outcomes of young children with SCA.

Prognostic models can aid in targeted monitoring but an overview of their performance is lacking. This study aimed to systematically review prognostic models for the risk of foot ulcer or amputation and quantify their predictive performance in an independent cohort. METHODS: A systematic review identified studies developing prognostic models for foot ulcer or amputation over minimal 1 year follow-up applicable to people with type 2 diabetes. After data extraction and risk of bias assessment (both in duplicate), selected models were externally validated in a prospective cohort with a 5 year follow-up in terms of discrimination (C statistics) and calibration (calibration plots). RESULTS: We identified 21 studies with 34 models predicting polyneuropathy, foot ulcer or amputation. Eleven models were validated in 7624 participants, of whom 485 developed an ulcer and 70 underwent amputation. The models for foot ulcer showed C statistics (95% CI) ranging from 0.54 (0.54, 0.54) to 0.81 (0.75, 0.86) and models for amputation showed C statistics (95% CI) ranging from 0.63 (0.55, 0.71) to 0.86 (0.78, 0.94). Most models underestimated the ulcer or amputation risk in the highest risk quintiles. Three models performed well to predict a combined endpoint of amputation and foot ulcer (C statistics >0.75).

In addition to typical respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea, a large percentage of COVID-19 patients experience gastrointestinal (GI) complaints, with the most common symptoms being diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. SUMMARY: We comprehensively summarize the latest knowledge of the adverse effects of COVID-19 and therapeutic drugs on the GI system, as well as related disease pathogenesis, and then provide a discussion focusing on the management and vaccination of patients who have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and GI cancer. The virus can affect the digestive system via binding to ACE2 receptors and subsequent gut microbiome dysbiosis. Through a variety of molecular pathways and mechanisms, numerous drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 could interfere with GI function and lead to multiple clinical manifestations, which may further intensify the risk and severity of GI symptoms of COVID-19 infection, such as nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis, and gastric ulcers. KEY MESSAGES: We should monitor GI manifestations closely while managing COVID-19 patients and take timely measures to reduce the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in GI cancer patients. IBD patients should receive vaccination timely, but corticosteroid use should be minimized when they are vaccinated. Simultaneously, for persons with IBD who have known or suspected COVID-19, immunosuppressive agents, especially thiopurines, should be avoided/minimized if possible.","output":"Gastrointestinal Disease and COVID-19: A Review of Current Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Balanced nutrition which can help in maintaining immunity is essential for prevention and management of viral infections.

Therefore, we sought to characterize the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a live registry of heart failure patients across an integrated health care system in Connecticut. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) that includes 26,703 patients with heart failure across a 6-hospital integrated health care system in Connecticut was queried on April 16th, 2020 for all patients tested for COVID-19. Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry. Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: COVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N = 26,703). Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID- 19+. As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P<0.05, all). COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers. 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33-2.78); P<0.001].

Therefore, there is a pressing need to analyze the extent of the impact that unfolded from the pandemic on each Sustainable Development Goal and further to direct the post-pandemic situation to accelerate the progress in every goal. Besides, there exists a knowledge gap in understanding the Sustainable Development Goals and its interaction with each goal through synergic and trade-off effects. To address the aforementioned imperative problems, this study is formulated to perform an impact assessment as well as to provide direction in the post-pandemic environment to effectively progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals by using a hybrid qualitative and quantitative framework. A detailed investigation is carried out to examine the pandemic impacts in every goal, and a quantified impact analysis is performed in terms of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals with the aid of ranking methodology. The results indicate that SDG 1 and SDG 8 are the most impacted goal. To provide deeper perspectives into the Sustainable Development Goals, a critical analysis of the targets and indicators is performed to characterize the goals from their elemental point of view, such as nature of goals, depending factors, locus of the goal, and Sustainable Development Goal interactions. Further, a novel parameter, the degree of randomness, is proposed whose application in environmental research is immense.

Five patients presented positive culture samples after tocilizumab, three being of clinical significance. A lower lymphocyte count was associated with having a positive culture. No other significant adverse events were seen. Conclusion: Our study suggests the utility and shows the safety of tocilizumab use in COVID-19 patients who have respiratory failure and evidence of hyperinflammation.

Wrist-worn fitness wearable devices record heart beats 24/7 having a complete overview of users heart status. Due to motion artefacts affecting QRS complexes recording, and the different nature of the heart rate sensor used on wearable devices compared to ECG, traditionally used to compute SDNN24, the estimation of this important Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric has never been performed from wearable data. We propose an innovative approach to estimate SDNN24 only exploiting the Heart Rate (HR) that is normally available on wearable fitness trackers and less affected by data noise. The standard deviation of inter-beats intervals (SDNN24) and the standard deviation of the Average inter-beats intervals (ANN) derived from the HR (obtained in a time window with defined duration, i.e., 1, 5, 10, 30 and 60 min), i.e., [Formula: see text] (SDANN [Formula: see text] 24), were calculated over 24 h. Power spectrum analysis using the Lomb-Scargle Peridogram was performed to assess frequency domain HRV parameters (Ultra Low Frequency, Very Low Frequency, Low Frequency, and High Frequency). Due to the fact that SDNN24 reflects the total power of the power of the HRV spectrum, the values estimated from HR measures (SDANN [Formula: see text] 24) underestimate the real values because of the high frequencies that are missing. Subjects with low and high cardiovascular risk show different power spectra. In particular, differences are detected in Ultra Low and Very Low frequencies, while similar results are shown in Low and High frequencies. For this reason, we found that HR measures contain enough information to discriminate cardiovascular risk. Semi-continuous measures of HR throughout 24 h, as measured by most wrist-worn fitness wearable devices, should be sufficient to estimate SDNN24 and cardiovascular risk.","output":"SDNN24 Estimation from Semi-Continuous HR Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After first reports of a new predominantely respiratory illness detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China in Dezember 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spreads all over China and the world.

Identification of factors which contribute to the occurrence of runway overruns can help mitigate the risk and prevent such accidents. Methods such as physics-based and statistical-based models were proposed in the past to estimate runway overrun probabilities. However, they are either costly or require experts' knowledge. We propose a statistical approach to quantify the risk probability of an aircraft to exceed a threshold at the speed of 80 knots given a set of influencing factors. This copula based D-vine regression approach is used because it allows for complex tail dependence and is computationally tractable. Data obtained from the Quick Access Recorder (QAR) for 711 flights are analyzed. We identify 41 flights with an estimated risk probability>0.001 for a chosen threshold and rank the effects of each influencing factor for these flights. Also, the complex dependency patterns between some influencing factors for the 41 flights are shown to be non symmetric. The D-vine regression approach, compared to physics-based and statistical-based approaches, has an analytical solution, is not simulation based and can be used to estimate very small or large probabilities efficiently.","output":"An Application of D-vine Regression for the Identification of Risky Flights in Runway Overrun"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) is a potentially life-saving treatment for refractory haematological malignancies. Many UK CAR-T services are in their infancy. Patient perspectives on service delivery, treatment toxicity and impact on health related quality of life (HRQoL) are lacking. This qualitative evaluation aimed to explore the patient and carer experience of CAR-T and identify areas for service improvement. Methods: Patients who received CAR-T between April 2019 and March 2021 at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who attended primary or follow-up appointments between December 2020 and March 2021 were asked if they wanted to take part in the evaluation. 16 semi-structured qualitative interviews were carried out with 10 patients and 4 carers at specific time points in the patient journey: hospital admission prior to CAR T-cell infusion, day 28 postinfusion and routine follow-up appointments after treatment (8, 9, 12 and 18 months). Five patients completed 2 interviews (pre-infusion and day 28). Results: The mean age of the patients was 54 and 60% were female. Nine patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and one had primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Inductive thematic analysis identified three main themes. The importance of the CAR-T nurse specialist as a point of contact was consistently identified by patients and carers as vital to navigating the treatment process. The continuity of care and approachability associated with this role were linked to patient satisfaction and perceived level of support received. Reported treatment toxicity centred on fatigue, poor appetite/weight loss and problems with memory and cognition. Patients and carers were well prepared for side effects in the acute treatment phase but some felt less prepared for prolonged impact on physical function and cognition after discharge. CAR-T therapy was viewed as a 'lifeline,' but the uncertainty of treatment outcome caused significant anxiety, disruption to employment and family life, and made it difficult to make future plans. Many responses were framed by the COVID-19 pandemic which increased feelings of isolation and vulnerability and had a significant, negative impact on HRQoL. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first qualitative work exploring the views of CAR-T patients and carers at multiple points in the patient journey, including perspectives on long-term treatment impact. Considerations for service creation and development nationally and internationally include: the importance of a dedicated nurse specialist, preparing patients for and supporting them with prolonged treatment side effects, and the psychological challenges associated with prognostic uncertainty. Expanding indications of CAR-T therapy mean there is an urgent need for multi-centre studies incorporating patient-reported outcome data to inform patient centred care and service delivery.","output":"The patient and carer experience of chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapy for relapsed/ refractory B-cell lymphoma at a UK regional centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 59-year-old man with progressive cognitive decline and mood disturbances was admitted to the hospital.

Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LapGB) is a procedure that lends itself well to single-site laparoscopic surgery because the surgery is confined to a single region of the body, the need for a larger incision for port implantation and the fact that bariartric patients are more likely to be body image conscious. The procedure is, however, technically challenging and potentially more time consuming and hazardous. To simplify learning, a hybrid technique that used multiple conventional trocars and laparoscopic equipment through a single periumbilical incision while retaining the use of the Nathanson retractor via a separate epigastric incision was developed. The authors' experience and results with this technique are described. METHODS This retrospective review describes the prospectively collected data for the first 60 consecutive cases completed using the minimally invasive technique described. RESULTS The 60 cases in this study comprised 12 men and 48 women with an average age of 39 years (range 20-59 years). Their average body mass index (BMI) was 39.1 kg/m(2) (range 32-52 kg/m(2)). Four patients (6.7%) needed an additional port either for hemostasis or for access difficulties. Concomitant hiatal hernia repair was performed for 13 patients. Five patients (8.3%) had superficial wound infection requiring oral antibiotic therapy and dressings. No other complications were observed. Overall, the average operating time was 55 min (range 30-160 min). For both surgeons, the learning curve was six cases, with a significant difference in the operating times between the first six cases and the remaining cases (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSIONS The authors' early experience with the minimally invasive LapGB technique shows that it is feasible and safe. It can be used either as a bridging technique to single-site LapGB or on its own as a minimally invasive technique.","output":"On the road to single-site laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding: lessons learned from 60 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In single-case research designs (SCDs) to determine a functional relation a time-series graph is constructed.

Descriptive statistics were used, with Kruskal-Wallis and regression analysis performed. RESULTS All postpartum women stated that they were affected negatively by COVID-19. The most common issues described were feeling alone (25.51%), having economic difficulties (15.5%) and experiencing difficulties accessing health services (21.7%). The mean Postpartum Support Scale score was 102.43  27.67, while the mean Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale score was 188.07  96.71. COVID-19 exposure level had a significant effect on postpartum-specific anxiety (p=0.00). The variables of having a problem during pregnancy (p=0.006), having a baby willingly (p=0.007), and partner's educational status significantly predicted the degree of being affected by COVID-19 (p=0.025). The degree to which COVID-19 affected the women was determined by having problems during pregnancy, having a baby willingly, and a highly educated partner.

Here we report that a single small-molecule compound, RepSox, is sufficient to induce adipogenesis from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in fibroblast culture medium. RepSox is an inhibitor of the transforming growth factor-beta receptor I (TGF--RI), other inhibitors of TGF- pathway such as SB431542, LY2157299, A83-01, and Tranilast are also effective in inducing adipogenesis from MEFs. These adipocytes express brown adipocyte-specific transcription factors and thermogenesis genes, and contain a large number of mitochondria and have a high level of mitochondrial respiratory activity. More interestingly, RepSox has also been found to promote the differentiation of the brown fat precursor cells and induce browning of the white fat precursor cells.

However, diverse state regulations of pharmacists scope of practice create a discrepancy between what pharmacists are trained to do and what they legally can do. This study investigated how stakeholders utilized research evidence when developing expanded scope of practice policies in their respective states. METHODS: Using autonomous pharmacist prescriptive authority as a surrogate for general pharmacist scope of practice, a general policy document analysis was performed to understand the scope of practice landscape for pharmacists across the United States. Next, semi-structured interviews with policy-makers and pharmacy advocates were conducted to explore how the identified states in the policy document analysis utilized evidence during the policy-making process. Investigators analysed findings from the transcribed interviews through application of the SPIRIT Action Framework. Resulting codes were summarized across themes, and recommendations to researchers about increasing utilization of research evidence were crafted. RESULTS: Sixteen states with 27 autonomous pharmacist prescriptive authority policies were identified. Public health need and safety considerations motivated evidence engagement, while key considerations dictating utilization of research included perceptions of research, access to resources and experts, and the successful implementation of similar policy. Research evidence helped to advocate for and set terms for pharmacist prescribing. Barriers to research utilization include stakeholder opposition to pharmacist prescribing, inability to interpret research, and a lack of relevant evidence. Recommendations for researchers include investigating specific metrics to evaluate scope of practice policy, developing relationships between policy-makers and researchers, and leveraging pharmacy practice stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, alignment of researcher goals and legislative priorities, coupled with timely communication, may help to increase research evidence engagement in pharmacist scope of practice policy. By addressing these factors regarding research engagement identified in this study, researchers can increase evidence-based scope of practice, which can help to improve patient outcomes, contain costs, and provide pharmacists with the legal infrastructure to practise at the top of their license.

To address literature shortcomings, we chose the intrinsically water-soluble enzyme a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) and large unilamellar vesicles with a relative broad phase transition. We here present activity measurements of ADAMTS13 in the freely dissolved state and the membrane associated state for phosphocholine lipids with different acyl-chain lengths (13:0, 14:0 and 15:0) and thus main phase transition temperatures. While the freely dissolved enzyme shows a simple Arrhenius behavior, the activity of membrane associated ADAMTS13 in addition shows a peak. This peak temperature correlates with the main phase transition temperature of the used lipids. These findings support an alternative theory of catalysis. This theory predicts a correlation of the membrane associated activity and the heat capacity, as both are susceptibilities of the same surface Gibb's free energy, since the enzyme is attached to the membrane.","output":"The activity of the intrinsically water-soluble enzyme ADAMTS13 correlates with the membrane state when bound to a phospholipid bilayer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For thousands of years, fungi have been a valuable and promising source of therapeutic agents for treatment of various diseases.

Parents are less active than non-parent contemporaries and constitute a large potential intervention population. However, little is known about the breadth and scope of parental PA research. This scoping review therefore aimed to provide an overview of the current evidence base on parental PA. METHODS Four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Scopus) were systematically searched to identify peer-reviewed articles focusing on parental PA from 2005 onwards, including interventional, observational or qualitative study designs. Title and abstract screening was followed by duplicate full-text screening. Data extracted for all articles (100% checked by a second reviewer) included study design, proportion of fathers and ages of children. For interventional/observational studies, PA assessment method and factors examined or targeted based on the socio-ecological model were extracted, and questions addressed in qualitative studies. RESULTS Of 14 913 unique records retrieved, 213 articles were included; 27 articles reported on more than one study design; 173 articles reported on quantitative (81 cross-sectional, 26 longitudinal and 76 interventional) and 58 on qualitative data. Most articles originated from North America (62%), and 53% included only mothers, while 2% included only fathers. Articles most frequently represented parents of infants (56% of articles), toddlers (43%), preschoolers (50%) and primary-school aged children (49%). Most quantitative articles only reported self-reported PA (70%). Observational articles focused on individual correlates/determinants (88%). Likewise, most interventions (88% of articles) targeted individual factors. Most qualitative articles explored PA barriers and facilitators (57%). CONCLUSIONS A range of quantitative and qualitative research has been conducted on parental PA.

Methods Adult patients suspected of COVID-19 aged >18 years who underwent chest CT scans and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests within 14 days of symptom onset were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to the results of the RT-PCR tests. The basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for the confirmed and nonconfirmed groups. Results A total of 130 patients were enrolled, with 54 testing positive and 76 testing negative. The typical CT imaging features of the positive group were ground glass opacities (GGOs), the crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally and close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features were combined, GGOs with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGOs with pleural distribution were more common among the positive patients, found in 31 (57.4%) and 30 patients (55.6%), respectively. The combinations were almost all statistically significant (P < .05), except for the combination of GGOs with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations was approximately 90%. Conclusions The combinations with GGOs could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, alerting clinicians to isolate patients for prompt treatment and repeat RT-PCR tests until the end of incubation.","output":"Early chest computed tomography to diagnose COVID-19 from suspected patients: A multicenter retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Krze: Die Anforderungen zum Monitoring und zur Basisdiagnostik nach stattgehabtem Schlaganfall wurden bereits ausfhrlich in 7 Abschn. 5.1 dargestellt.

From its initial uses in biological research to its current importance in the biopharmaceutical industry, many types of culture media were developed: from serum-based media to serum-free to protein-free chemically defined media. The cultivation of animal cells economically has become the ultimate goal in the field of biomanufacturing. Serum serves as a source of amino acids, lipids, proteins and most importantly growth factors and hormones, which are essential for many cell types. However, the use of serum is unfavorable due to its high price tag, increased lot-to-lot variations and potential risk of microbial contamination. Efforts are progressively being made to replace serum with recombinant proteins such as growth factors, cytokines and hormones, as well as supplementation with lipids, vitamins, trace elements and hydrolysates. While hydrolysates are more complex, they provide a diverse source of nutrients to animal cells, with potential beneficial effects beyond the nutritional value.

In negotiations, such threats may come from a counterpart's competitive behavior. We developed and tested the argument that individuals high in face threat sensitivity, when negotiating with a competitive (vs. cooperative) counterpart, exhibit psychological responses that inhibit them from claiming value in distributive negotiations. Employing a face-to-face interaction paradigm, Study 1 revealed that higher counterpart competitiveness was negatively associated with high (but not low) FTS negotiators global self-esteem, which in turn led them to be less demanding and obtain worse negotiation outcomes. In Study 2, employing a simulated on-line interaction paradigm, we manipulated counterparts behavior (cooperative vs. competitive) to establish causality and examined specific aspects of negotiator global self-esteem that may account for the effect. We found that the effect of counterparts competitiveness on high FTS negotiators demand levels was mediated by their performance self-esteem, but not by their social self-esteem. In Study 3, we manipulated performance self-esteem to establish it as a causal underlying psychological mechanism. For high FTS negotiators, when performance self-esteem was low, demand levels were significantly lower with a competitive (vs. cooperative) counterpart. However, when performance self-esteem was high, there was no significant difference in demand levels depending on counterparts behavior. This finding suggests that negotiating with a competitive (vs. cooperative) counterpart reduces high FTS negotiators performance self-esteem, which in turn leads them to make lower demands.

In this scenario, we performed a prospective analysis of outcomes of our patients undergoing SDD protocol after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Material and Methods The SDD criteria included patients with no intraoperative complications, stable postoperative hemoglobin levels (compared to preoperative values), stable vital signs, normal urine output, ambulation with assistance and independently without dizziness, tolerance of clear liquids without nausea or vomiting, pain control with oral medication, and patient/family confidence with SDD. Patients older than 70 years, concomitant general surgery operations, multiple comorbidities, and complex procedures such as salvage surgery were excluded from our protocol. Results Of the 101 patients who met the criteria for SDD, 73 (72%) had a successful SDD. All SDF (Same day discharge failure) patients were discharged one day after surgery. Intraoperative characteristics were not statistically different with a median operative time of 92 (81-107) vs 103 (91-111) minutes for SDD and SDF respectively. Of the 28 SDF patients, the most common reasons for staying were anesthesia-related factors of nausea (35%), drowsiness (7%), patient/caregiver preference (25%), pain (14%), labile blood pressure (7%), arrhythmia (7%), and dizziness (7%). There was no significant difference in readmission rates, complication rates, or post-operative pain scores between SDD and SDF patients. Conclusions In our experience, SDD for patients undergoing RARP can be safely and feasibly incorporated into a clinical care pathway without increasing readmission rates. We were successful in 72% of cases due to coordinated care between anesthetics, nursing staff, and appropriate patient selection. We also believe that incorporating pre-and postoperative patient education and assurance is crucial to minimize their exposure to COVID-19 during the surgical treatment for prostate cancer.","output":"Same Day Discharge Protocol for Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: the experience of a High-Volume Referral Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers have long discussed the rich clinical applications of attachment theory. Specifically, clinicians have been compelled by the idea that insecure attachment, broadly speaking, may bring about stressful (real or perceived) interpersonal experiences that increases risk for internalizing symptoms. However, recent meta-analyses examining the links between attachment representations and internalizing symptoms have challenged this assumption, highlighting the importance of considering insecure attachment subtypes in understanding one's vulnerability for internalizing symptoms. Here we expand on this special issue's target papers and propose that, despite an increase in citation impact of clinically relevant attachment research, there are still core theoretical and methodological questions left unanswered. We highlight three clinical conundrums: (1) hyperactivating, but not deactivating, attachment is linked to increased internalizing symptoms in adolescence and adulthood; (2) the magnitude of the associations between insecure attachment subtypes and internalizing symptoms varies depending on the developmental period; and (3) self-reported, but not narrative-based, deactivating attachment is associated with increased internalizing symptoms. We call for engagement with adjunct academic disciplines to elucidate these issues.

Myocardial cytopathy associated with hypoxic response has been largely overlooked in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, histology analysis and cardiac function of COVID-19 cases are often reported separately, rendering an incomplete understanding of COVID-19 cardiac symptoms. Objective To examine the relationship between myocardial cellular responses to hypoxic stress versus cardiac functional alterations within the same COVID-19 patients. Design, Setting, and Participants Cellular hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 alpha (HIF1) expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using post-mortem COVID-19 heart and lung tissues with known cardiac echocardiography records from a total of 8 patients. Clinical echocardiography data were obtained from Mount Sinai Heart between March to December, 2020. All gender and age groups were considered as long as cardiac involvement meets the preserved (EF > 50%) or moderate to severe (EF < 45%) criteria with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cell-type specific subcellular localization of HIF1 expression and nuclear stability was examined by immunohistochemistry and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to quantify apoptosis. Main Outcomes and Measures No planned outcomes of this study as this is a retrospective analysis based on post-mortem specimens exclusively. Results Cardiac HIF1 expression was found to be significantly higher in patients with preserved EF levels than it was in the low EF group. In the preserved EF group, HIF1 is protective against apoptosis predominantly in endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts. In the low EF group, HIF1 protects cardiomyocyte nuclear integrity as evident by its nuclear accumulation with nuclear envelope preservation. Conclusions and Relevance This study establishes a direct link of cardiac cellular responses to hypoxic stress with matching functional and histological data, serving as one of the first studies to bridge previous stand-alone clinical data and cellular data. The protective role of HIF1 in hearts may help predict cardiac involvement in not only COVID-19 patients, but also decipher the underlying mechanisms in other forms of viral cardiomyopathy.","output":"HIF1alpha cardioprotection in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inpainting-based image compression is emerging as a promising competitor to transform-based compression techniques.

Even though the strengths of PDE- and transform-based compression are complementary, they have rarely been combined within a hybrid codec. We propose to sparsify blocks of a JPEG compressed image and reconstruct them with EED inpainting.

The methodology of FPCA is developed under the framework of generalized linear models. It provides statistical models for FPCA not limited to matrix expressions of the data. A maximum likelihood approach is proposed to derive the decomposition when the number of principal components (PCs) is known.

It is crucial to investigate the spatial drivers to prevent and control the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: This is the first comprehensive study of COVID-19 in Iran; and it carries out spatial modeling, risk mapping, change detection, and outbreak trend analysis of the disease spread. Four main steps were taken: comparison of Iranian coronavirus data with the global trends, prediction of mortality trends using regression modeling, spatial modeling, risk mapping, and change detection using the random forest (RF) machine learning technique (MLT), and validation of the modeled risk map. RESULTS: The results show that from February 19 to June 14, 2020, the average growth rates (GR) of COVID-19 deaths and the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran were 1.08 and 1.10, respectively. Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) data, Iran's fatality rate (deaths/0.1M pop) is 10.53. Other countries' fatality rates were, for comparison, Belgium - 83.32, UK - 61.39, Spain - 58.04, Italy - 56.73, Sweden - 48.28, France - 45.04, USA - 35.52, Canada - 21.49, Brazil - 20.10, Peru - 19.70, Chile - 16.20, Mexico- 12.80, and Germany - 10.58. The fatality rate for China is 0.32 (deaths/0.1M pop). Over time, the heatmap of the infected areas identified two critical time intervals for the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. The provinces were classified in terms of disease and death rates into a large primary group and three provinces that had critical outbreaks were separate from the others. The heatmap of countries of the world shows that China and Italy were distinguished from other countries in terms of nine viral infection-related parameters. The regression models for death cases showed an increasing trend but with some evidence of turning. A polynomial relationship was identified between the coronavirus infection rate and the province population density. Also, a third-degree polynomial regression model for deaths showed an increasing trend recently, indicating that subsequent measures taken to cope with the outbreak have been insufficient and ineffective. The general trend of deaths in Iran is similar to the world's, but Iran's shows lower volatility. Change detection of COVID-19 risk maps with a random forest model for the period from March 11 to March 18 showed an increasing trend of COVID-19 in Iran's provinces. It is worth noting that using the LASSO MLT to evaluate variables' importance, indicated that the most important variables were the distance from bus stations, bakeries, hospitals, mosques, ATMs (automated teller machines), banks, and the minimum temperature of the coldest month.

RESULTS: The mean facility annual retention rate was 64% and the mean annual turnover rate was 55%. As expected, there was a statistically significant and negative correlation between the rates (r = -0.26). However, some facilities had both high retention and high turnover and some had low rates for both measures.

Therefore, this fact has changed the original UV conception as a germicide and potentially damaging agent, leading to the concept that it is worthy of application in harvested commodities to take advantage of its beneficial responses. Four decades have already passed since postharvest UV radiation applications began to be studied. During this time, UV treatments have been successfully evaluated for different purposes, including the selection of raw materials, the control of postharvest diseases and human pathogens, the elicitation of nutraceutical compounds, the modulation of ripening and senescence, and the induction of cross-stress tolerance. Besides the microbicide use of UV radiation, the effect that has received most attention is the elicitation of bioactive compounds as a defense mechanism. UV treatments have been shown to induce the accumulation of phytochemicals, including ascorbic acid, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and, more frequently, phenolic compounds. The nature and extent of this elicitation have been reported to depend on several factors, including the product type, maturity, cultivar, UV spectral region, dose, intensity, and radiation exposure pattern.

A preCpost mean difference in the VAS score of 0.5 was found for nasal obstruction (p = .01), 0.7 for pruritus (p < .001), 0.7 points for rhinorrhea (p < .001), and 0.8 for ocular symptoms (p < .001). Factors associated with worsening of AR symptom scores were pet ownership, atopic dermatitis, lower educational level, and a low number of immunotherapy doses applied before lockdowns. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of patients reported worsening of their AR symptoms, probably due to higher exposure to indoor AR allergens and interruption of immunotherapy during COVID\\\\19 lockdowns.","output":"Impact of the COVID\\\\19 national lockdown in the allergic rhinitis symptoms in patients treated with immunotherapy at two allergy referral centers in Bogot, Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, issues of human resource management gradually attract a lot of attention from organizational behavior scholars, thus how to effectively improve service employees job attitude and performance to meet the needs of stakeholders is one of the key issues in internal marketing. Based on the perspective of internal marketing, the study transforms the relevant factors applied to maintaining external customer relations into internal employee-oriented factors, so as to increase the understanding of the relationship between internal service recovery and internal relationship quality (IRQ). This study aims to explore (1) whether internal service recovery enhances IRQ; (2) whether internal relationship investment (IRI) positively moderates relationship between internal service recovery and IRQ; and (3) whether effectiveness of internal service recovery differentiates under different exchange relationship (high/low quality leader-member exchange). In this study, a total of 206 Mainland China and 250 Taiwanese participants were collected. In this study, a variance-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed to test the proposed hypothesizes and conduct comparative analysis. Empirical results in both samples show that internal service recovery has positive and significant effects on IRQ; internal relationship investment and leader-member exchange (LMX) positively and significantly moderate the relationship between internal service recovery and IRQ. Finally, based on the results, this study provides some discussions, suggestions and managerial implications for future studies in organizational management.","output":"How Internal Marketing Drives Employees Internal Relationship Quality of Service Organizations Between Mainland China and Taiwan: The Moderating Roles of Internal Relationship Investment and Leader-Member Exchange"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Several studies have reported prone positioning of nonintubated patients with coronavirus diseases 2019-related hypoxemic respiratory failure. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of prone positioning on oxygenation and clinical outcomes. DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the coronavirus diseases 2019 living systematic review from December 1, 2019, to November 9, 2020. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: Studies reporting prone positioning in hypoxemic, nonintubated adult patients with coronavirus diseases 2019 were included. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data on prone positioning location (ICU vs non-ICU), prone positioning dose (total minutes/d), frequency (sessions/d), respiratory supports during prone positioning, relative changes in oxygenation variables (peripheral oxygen saturation, Pao2, and ratio of Pao2 to the Fio2), respiratory rate pre and post prone positioning, intubation rate, and mortality were extracted. Twenty-five observational studies reporting prone positioning in 758 patients were included. There was substantial heterogeneity in prone positioning location, dose and frequency, and respiratory supports provided. Significant improvements were seen in ratio of Pao2 to the Fio2 (mean difference, 39;95% CI, 25-54), Pao2 (mean difference, 20 mm Hg;95% CI, 14-25), and peripheral oxygen saturation (mean difference, 4.74%;95% CI, 3-6%). Respiratory rate decreased post prone positioning (mean difference, -3.2 breaths/min;95% CI, -4.6 to -1.9). Intubation and mortality rates were 24% (95% CI, 17-32%) and 13% (95% CI, 6-19%), respectively. There was no difference in intubation rate in those receiving prone positioning within and outside ICU (32% [69/214] vs 33% [107/320];p = 0.84). No major adverse events were recorded in small subset of studies that reported them. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the significant variability in frequency and duration of prone positioning and respiratory supports applied, prone positioning was associated with improvement in oxygenation variables without any reported serious adverse events. The results are limited by a lack of controls and adjustments for confounders. Whether this improvement in oxygenation results in meaningful patient-centered outcomes such as reduced intubation or mortality rates requires testing in well-designed randomized clinical trials.","output":"Prone Positioning of Nonintubated Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Background Telemedicine is uniquely positioned to address challenges posed to emergency departments (EDs) by the COVID-19 pandemic. By reducing in-person contact, it should decrease provider risk of infection and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Objectives To describe and assess the early results of a novel telehealth workflow in which remote providers collaborate with in-person nursing to evaluate and discharge well-appearing, low-risk ED patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods Retrospective chart review was completed three weeks after implementation. Metrics include the number of patients evaluated, number of patients discharged without in-person contact, telehealth wait time and duration, collection of testing, ED length of stay (ED-LOS), 72-hour return, number of in-person healthcare provider contacts, and associated PPE use. Results Among 302 patients evaluated by telehealth, 153 patients were evaluated and discharged by a telehealth provider with reductions in ED-LOS, PPE use, and close contact with healthcare personnel. These patients had a 62.5% shorter ED-LOS compared to other ESI Level 4 patients seen over the same time period. Telehealth use for these 153 patients saved 413 sets of PPE. We observed a 3.9% 72-hour revisit rate. One patient discharged after telehealth evaluation was hospitalized on a return visit 9 days later. Conclusion Telehealth can be safely and efficiently used to evaluate, treat, test, and discharge ED patients suspected to have COVID-19. This workflow reduces infection risks to healthcare providers, PPE use, and ED-LOS. Additionally, it allows quarantined but otherwise well clinicians to continue working.","output":"Preliminary Assessment of a Telehealth Approach to Evaluating, Treating, and Discharging Low Acuity Patients with Suspected COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although firms increasingly publish sustainability reports, assuring such reports is relatively new.

METHODS: We prospectively assessed the medical records, laboratory results, chest CT images and use of medication in a cohort of patients presenting to two designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China. Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of disease severity. Acute myocardial injury was defined by a value of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) greater than the normal upper limit. RESULTS: A total of 101 cases were enrolled from January to 10 March 2020 (average age 49 years, IQR 34-62 years). Acute myocardial injury was present in 15.8% of patients, nearly half of whom had a hs-TnT value fivefold greater than the normal upper limit. Patients with acute myocardial injury were older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and more likely to require ICU admission (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p<0.001) and treatment with vasoactive agents (31.2% vs 0%, p<0.001).

The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24 till March 3 window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.","output":"Quantifying the effect of quarantine control in Covid-19 infectious spread using machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis of anthropological research has occurred that requires both methodological and epistemological considerations.

However, the emotional distress on the Spanish population remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of emotional disorders and related symptoms and to assess the influence of sociodemographic characteristics on this population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey using an online platform. Participation was completely voluntary. Sociodemographic variables were collected and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and panic were assessed through three questionnaires: Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-Panic Disorder (PHQ-PD). Chi-squared statistics were applied to determine the influence of sociodemographic variables on symptom severity and diagnosis. Results Most respondents (n=1753) were female (76.8%), with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 (12.9) years; 39.1% were married and 39.5% held a high school degree. Severe and moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression were high (6.5% and 14.3%; 9.9% and 12.9%, respectively) and more than one in four participants (25.7%) experienced a panic attack. A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD; 12.2% for MDD; and 17.2% for PD. Significant risk factors were as follows: female, young adult, single, unemployed, and low income. Conclusion Due to limitations related to the study design (convenience sample), the findings of these study may not be applicable to the general population.

Perioperative oral care is an effective measure for preventing postoperative pneumonia. However, the preventive effects of perioperative oral care on SSIs have not been reported. We investigated the preventive effects of perioperative oral care on SSIs after pancreatic cancer surgery. METHODS A total of 103 patients with PDAC who underwent radical resection at Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital (2011-2018) were enrolled in this retrospective study. Of the 103 patients, 75 received perioperative oral care by dentists and dental hygienists (oral care group), whereas 28 did not (control group). Univariate and multivariate analyses with propensity score as a covariate were used to investigate the incidence and risk factors of SSIs in the oral care and control groups. RESULTS The incidence of SSIs was significantly lower in the oral care group than in the control group (12.0% vs. 39.3%, P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis revealed that a soft pancreas, the surgical procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy), blood transfusion, diabetes mellitus, and the absence of oral care intervention were risk factors for SSIs. The odds ratio for the absence of oral care intervention was 6.090 (95% confidence interval: 1.750-21.200, P = 0.004). CONCLUSION Our results suggest that perioperative oral care may reduce the risk of developing SSIs after pancreatic cancer surgery. These findings need to be evaluated in future prospective studies.

We aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics on vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in a multi-center survey conducted within French healthcare facilities from 1 December 2020 to 26 March 2021. We invited any healthcare workers na?ve of COVID-19 vaccination to complete an online self-questionnaire. They reported on their socio-demographic characteristics, as well as their perception and beliefs towards vaccination. We measured their willingness to get vaccinated in eight scenarios for candidates vaccines presented sequentially (1 to 4-point scale). Candidates vaccines varied for efficacy (25%, 50%, 100%), length of immunization (1 year or lifetime), frequency (&lt;1/100, &lt;1/10,000), and severity (none, moderate, severe) of adverse events. We analyzed 4349 healthcare workers responses with interpretable questionnaires. The crude willingness to get vaccinated was 53.2% and increased over time. We clustered the trajectories of responses using an unsupervised classification algorithm (k-means) and identified four groups of healthcare workers: those willing to get vaccinated in any scenario (18%), those not willing to get vaccinated at all (22%), and those hesitating but more likely to accept (32%) or reject (28%) the vaccination depending on the scenario. In these last two subgroups, vaccine acceptance was growing with age, educational background and was higher among men with condition. Compared to an ideal vaccine candidate, a 50% reduced efficacy resulted in an average drop in acceptance by 0.8 (SD  0.8, ?23.5%), while it was ranging from 1.4 (SD  1.0, ?38.4%) to 2.1 (SD  1.0, ?58.4%) in case of severe but rare adverse event. The acceptance of a mandatory immunization program was 29.6% overall and was positively correlated to the willingness to get vaccinated, ranging from 2.4% to 60.0%. Even if healthcare workers represent a heterogeneous population, most (80%) could accept the vaccination against COVID-19. Their willingness to get the vaccine increased over time and as immunization programs became available. Among hesitant professionals, the fear of adverse events was the main concern.

The viral infection initiates inflammatory responses leading to endothelial damage and coagulation cascade dysfnction. Spread of COVID-19 has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and subsequent coagulopathy. Initially coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients result in significant elevation of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and abnormalities in coagulatory parameters, which resulting in formation of thrombus and eventually death. METHODOLOGY: Present report intends to summarize the information of the research reports available so far on the complications of formation of unusal blood clots (thrombosis) during COVID-19 infection and its therapeutic strategies. Extensive web search was done for various reports associating COVID-19 infection with increased coagulopathy and abnormal coagulatory parameters such as PT, PTT, and platelet counts; along with increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Findings of these research reports were summarized to recommend cautions for clinicians while treating COVID-19 patient. Screening of coagulatory parameters upon admission and during entire course of treatment is recommended, especially those who are at increased risk of thrombosis. Also, anticoagulant treatment can be used as thromboprophylaxis measure.

Incidence estimates of pneumonia confirmed radiographically and with the use of current laboratory diagnostic tests are needed. METHODS We conducted active population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization among adults 18 years of age or older in five hospitals in Chicago and Nashville. Patients with recent hospitalization or severe immunosuppression were excluded. Blood, urine, and respiratory specimens were systematically collected for culture, serologic testing, antigen detection, and molecular diagnostic testing. Study radiologists independently reviewed chest radiographs. We calculated population-based incidence rates of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization according to age and pathogen. RESULTS From January 2010 through June 2012, we enrolled 2488 of 3634 eligible adults (68%). Among 2320 adults with radiographic evidence of pneumonia (93%), the median age of the patients was 57 years (interquartile range, 46 to 71); 498 patients (21%) required intensive care, and 52 (2%) died. Among 2259 patients who had radiographic evidence of pneumonia and specimens available for both bacterial and viral testing, a pathogen was detected in 853 (38%): one or more viruses in 530 (23%), bacteria in 247 (11%), bacterial and viral pathogens in 59 (3%), and a fungal or mycobacterial pathogen in 17 (1%). The most common pathogens were human rhinovirus (in 9% of patients), influenza virus (in 6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 5%).

For each pathogen, the incidence increased with age. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization was highest among the oldest adults. Despite current diagnostic tests, no pathogen was detected in the majority of patients. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently than bacteria.

The efficiency of a drug delivery vehicle is strongly dependent on its components which decide its interaction with partitioned drug(s) and locus of site of partitioning. A quantitative understanding of the physical chemistry underlying partitioning of drugs in complex systems of self-assemblies such as niosomes is scarcely available. In order to obtain quantitative mechanistic insights into partitioning and release of drugs [mitoxantrone (MTX) and ketoprofen (KTP)] in systems of niosomes, we have employed ultrasensitive calorimetry, spectroscopy and microscopy to establish correlations between functionality and energetics which could provide guidance towards rational drug design and choice of suitable non-ionic surfactant-based drug delivery vehicles. Electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) methods were used for characterization and assessing the morphology of niosomes. We present here a calorimetry-based approach in assessing the partitioning of the anticancer drugs mitoxantrone and ketoprofen in niosomes and their release to human serum albumin (HSA) employing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and comparison with equilibrium dialysis. The thermodynamic signatures and kinetics of release were analyzed to obtain insights into the role of the functional groups on the drugs in the partitioning process. The assessment of thermal and conformational stability of proteins during drug binding and the effect of drug delivery vehicles on proteins is also crucial. To assess these effects, DSC studies on HSA in the presence and absence of drugs and niosomes were also performed. Finally, the efficacy of the system to impact the cell viability of the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast carcinoma cell line was analysed using MTT assay.","output":"Mechanistic insights into encapsulation and release of drugs in colloidal niosomal systems: biophysical aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has hit the world, affecting health, medical care, economies and our society as a whole.

In the present study, an aptamer directed against the reverse transcriptase was analyzed for its potential to attain a temperature-dependent reverse transcriptase (hot start RT). FINDINGS: The hot start effect was investigated in a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Results with aptamer revealed a reduced RT activity at low temperatures while achieving full activity at the specific annealing temperature of 55 C. Sensitivity (limit of detection (LoD) 95 %) of the MERS-CoV assay was increased by about two times in the presence of aptamer.

A little studied potential fomite of great concern in the community is currency, which has been shown to harbor microbial pathogens in several studies. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses in the United States have limited the use of banknotes in favor of credit cards. However, SARS-CoV-2 has shown greater stability on plastic in several studies. Herein, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 at room temperature on banknotes, money cards and coins was investigated. In vitro studies with live virus suggested SARS-CoV-2 was highly unstable on banknotes, showing an initial rapid reduction in viable virus and no viral detection by 24 hours. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 displayed increased stability on money cards with live virus detected after 48 hours. Environmental swabbing of currency and money cards on and near the campus of Brigham Young University supported these results, with no detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on banknotes, and a low level on money cards. However, no viable virus was detected on either. These preliminary results suggest that the use of money cards over banknotes in order to slow the spread of this virus may be ill-advised.

Patients with sarcoidosis have been experiencing increased severity of COVID-19; however, the underlying pathological mechanisms remain elusive. To determine common transcriptional signatures and pathways between sarcoidosis and COVID-19, we investigated the whole-genome transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 and sarcoidosis, followed by various bioinformatic analyses, including gene ontology and pathways enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and gene regulatory network (GRN) construction. We identified 33 abnormally expressed genes that were common between COVID-19 and sarcoidosis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes were associated with cytokine production involved in immune response and T cell cytokine production. We identified several hub genes from the PPI network encoded by the common genes, which have high diagnostic potential for COVID-19 and sarcoidosis and could serve as promising biomarkers. Moreover, GRN analysis screened significant microRNAs and transcription factors that regulate the common genes. Thus, this study provides the first characterization of the transcriptional signatures and biological processes commonly dysregulated in sarcoidosis and COVID-19, and further identified several critical regulators and biomarkers.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline, COMET, and CROWN for COS published before January 2021 relevant to four life stages (pregnancy, newborns, children <8 years, and parents (adults aged 18C50 years)). We synthesized core outcomes into overarching constructs. RESULTS: From 46 COS we synthesized 414 core outcomes into 118 constructs. Quality of life, adverse events, medication use, hospitalization, and mortality were consistent across all stages. For pregnancy, common constructs included preterm birth, delivery mode, pre-eclampsia, gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, and hemorrhage; for newborns, birthweight, small for gestational age, neurological damage, and morbidity and infection/sepsis; for pediatrics, pain, gastrointestinal morbidity, growth/weight, breastfeeding, feeding problems, hearing, neurodevelopmental morbidity, and social development; and for adults, disease burden, mental health, neurological function/stroke, and cardiovascular health/morbidity. CONCLUSION: This COS synthesis generated outcome constructs that are of high value to stakeholders (participants, health providers, services), relevant to life course research, and could position cohorts for trial capabilities. IMPACT: We synthesized existing Core Outcome Sets as a transparent methodology that could prioritize outcomes for lifecourse cohorts with an interventional focus.

We aimed to assess the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of harm reduction counselling for abortion, which we define as the provision of information about safe abortion methods to pregnant persons seeking abortion. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane, Global Index Medicus and the grey literature up to October 2021. We included studies in which healthcare providers gave pregnant persons information on safe use of abortifacient medications without providing the actual medications. We conducted a descriptive summary of results and a risk of bias assessment using the ROBINS-I tool. Our primary outcome was the proportion of pregnant persons who used misoprostol to induce abortion rather than other methods among those who received harm reduction counselling. RESULTS We included four observational studies with a total of 4002 participants. Most pregnant persons who received harm reduction counselling induced abortion using misoprostol (79%-100%). Serious complication rates were low (0%-1%). Uterine aspiration rates were not always reported but were in the range of 6%-22%. Patient satisfaction with the harm reduction intervention was high (85%-98%) where reported. We rated the risk of bias for all studies as high due to a lack of comparison groups and high lost to follow-up rates. DISCUSSION Based on a synthesis of four studies with serious methodological limitations, most recipients of harm reduction counselling use misoprostol for abortion, have low complication rates, and are satisfied with the intervention.

Recruitment to RCTs for patients with cirrhosis and small oesophageal varices raises specific additional challenges. The objectives of the study were 1) to explore patient perspectives on factors that influence RCT recruitment, 2) to understand factors that influence the success of recruitment from a staff perspective, and 3) to identify opportunities for tailored interventions to improve trial recruitment in this context. METHODS: The qualitative study was embedded in a multi-centre blinded RCT (BOPPP trial) and was conducted alongside site opening. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients who enrolled to participate in the trial (n = 13), patients who declined to take part (n = 5), and staff who were responsible for recruiting participants to the trial (n = 18). An open approach to data collection and analysis was adopted and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to provide a theoretical lens through which to view influences on behaviour. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The findings consist of 5 overarching themes that outline trial recruitment influences at the patient, staff, team, organisational and trial levels: i) patient risks and benefits ii) staff attitudes, knowledge and capacity, iii) team-based approach, iv) organisational context and v) Trial collective. Patient-generated themes map onto thirteen of the fourteen TDF domains and staff-generated themes map onto all TDF domains. The overarching themes are not mutually exclusive; with evidence of direct interactions between patient and staff-level themes that influence recruitment behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses a theory-informed approach to gain new insights into improving clinical trial recruitment for patients with cirrhosis and small oesophageal varices. Although people with cirrhosis often display decreased healthcare-seeking behaviours, we found that patients used research to empower themselves to improve their health. Pragmatic trials involving unpredictable populations require staff expertise in building trust, and a deep knowledge of the patient group and their vulnerabilities. RCT recruitment is also more successful when research visits align with what staff identified as the natural rhythm of care.

In this article we explore the therapeutic potential of hexarelin, a synthetic hexapeptide growth hormone secretagogue (GHS), in an experimental model of ARDS. Hexarelin has anti-inflammatory properties and demonstrates cardiovascular-protective activities including the inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis, both of which may involve the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) system. METHODS: In our experimental model, ARDS was induced by the instillation of 100 mM HCl into the right bronchus; these mice were treated with hexarelin (320 g/kg, ip) before (Pre) or after (Post) HCl challenge, or with vehicle. Respiratory system compliance, blood gas analysis, and differential cell counts in a selective bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were determined 6 or 24 hours after HCl instillation. In an extended study, mice were observed for a subsequent 14 days in order to assess lung fibrosis. RESULTS: Hexarelin induced a significant improvement in lung compliance and a reduction of the number of total immune cells in BAL 24 hours after HCl instillation, accompanied with a lower recruitment of neutrophils compared with the vehicle group. At day 14, hexarelin-treated mice presented with less pulmonary collagen deposition compared with vehicle-treated controls.

With the lack of validated assessment tools, IWS is likely underdiagnosed in critically ill adult patients. METHODS: This was an IRB-approved, prospective, observational study assessing IWS based on Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) from October 2019 to November 2020. Patients were included if they were 18 years, admitted to the critical care medicine (CCM) service, and received 24 hours of continuous opioid infusion. Patients were excluded if they were admitted for drug overdose, intracranial pathology, active COVID-19, transitioned to withdrawal of life support or hospice, remained GCS 8 and/or RASS < -2 throughout assessment period, prisoners, pregnant patients, or missing 2 assessments. Patients were assessed within 24 hours from opioid cessation and followed for 5 days. The primary outcome was the incidence of at least moderate IWS diagnosis assessed using COWS. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of mild IWS based on COWS, the incidence of IWS diagnosis based on a positive DSM-V score, the correlation between diagnosis of IWS by DSM-V and COWS, and the identification of risk factors for IWS. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were included in the final analysis. Except for a higher prevalence of psychiatric history in the IWS-positive group, baseline characteristics were similar. Overall, 11 patients (12%) developed at least moderate IWS, based on COWS. There was a strong, positive correlation between DSM-V and COWS on the day COWS was the highest (rs(90)=0.64;p< 0.01). The IWSpositive group also had longer durations of opioid infusions, higher cumulative opioid infusion doses, higher mean daily doses, and higher infusion rates at any given time. No significant differences were found between the two groups for scheduled or PRN opioids after cessation of the opioid infusion. Logistic regression did not identify any independent predictors for the development of IWS. CONCLUSION: At least 12% of CCM patients who received 24 hours of continuous opioid infusions developed IWS.

Treatment with once-daily ozanimod (an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate [S1P] receptor modulator selectively targeting S1P1 and S1P5) in patients with moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) showed significant improvements in primary and all key secondary endpoints. Here we report findings on the consistency of clinical and endoscopic endpoints in the global and North American population. METHODS In True North, patients received either double-blind treatment with ozanimod 0.92 mg (equivalent to ozanimod HCl 1 mg) or matching placebo, or open-label ozanimod 0.92 mg over a 10-week induction period. Patients with clinical response to ozanimod at Week 10 were re-randomized 1:1 to receive double-blind maintenance treatment with ozanimod 0.92 mg or placebo through Week 52. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients in clinical remission at Weeks 10 and 52; key secondary endpoints included clinical response and endoscopic improvement. The global population included 1012 patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication during induction, and 457 who received at least 1 dose of study medication during maintenance. Here, we examine the results from the patients in the North American sites. RESULTS A total of 247 patients were enrolled in North America, of which 167 received double-blind ozanimod (n=107) or placebo (n=60) during induction. At baseline, 41.1% and 48.3% of patients in the ozanimod and placebo groups, respectively, had previously received a biologic treatment for UC. At Week 10, 15.9% and 3.3% of patients in the ozanimod and placebo groups, respectively, achieved clinical remission. In addition, 46.7% and 15.0% achieved clinical response and 26.2% and 10.0% achieved endoscopic improvement in the ozanimod and placebo groups, respectively. In patients with prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the proportion with clinical response favored ozanimod (35.7%) vs placebo (11.5%), while the proportion with clinical remission and endoscopic improvement did not favor ozanimod. In patients with no prior TNFi exposure, greater responses were seen with ozanimod vs placebo for all 3 endpoints. During maintenance, 105 patients from North America were re-randomized to treatment with ozanimod (n=56) or placebo (n=49). At Week 52, 39.3% and 12.2% of patients in the ozanimod and placebo groups, respectively, achieved clinical remission. In addition, 58.9% and 26.5% achieved clinical response and 50.0% and 16.3% achieved endoscopic improvement in the ozanimod and placebo groups, respectively. The proportion of patients with clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement favored ozanimod vs placebo regardless of prior TNFi use. These outcomes from the North American population are generally consistent with those previously reported from the global population. CONCLUSION In this post-hoc analysis, consistent with the global population, ozanimod treatment for up to 52 weeks in North American patients with moderately-to-severely active UC showed benefits on clinical and endoscopic endpoints.","output":"P035 Ozanimod for Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative Colitis: North American Population Results During Induction and Maintenance in the Phase 3 True North Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine algorithms approach to predict the number of COVID19 infections in different countries of America.

Previous studies have suggested that ICAM-1 triggers cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 or HTLV-1. SARS-CoV-2 shares several features with these viruses in interactions between cells, and SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell transmission is associated with COVID-19 severity. However, ICAM-1 and its associated pathways are not identified as essential factors in interactions between cells in COVID-19. For example, the current COVID-19 Disease Map has no entry for those pathways. Therefore, discovering unknown ICAM-1 pathways will be indispensable for clarifying the mechanism of COVID-19. This study builds ICAM1-associated pathways by gene network inference from single-cell omics data and multiple knowledge bases. First, data analyses extracted coexpressed genes with significant differences in expression levels with spurious correlations removed. Second, knowledge bases validate models. Finally, mapping the models onto existing pathways identifies new ICAM1-associated pathways. These pathways indicate that (1) upstream pathways include proteins in noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway and that (2) downstream pathways contain integrins and cytoskeleton or motor proteins for cell transformation. In this way, data-driven and knowledge-based approaches are integrated into gene network inference for ICAM1-associated pathway construction.

The object of this study is to examine the influence of socio-demographic and health-related factors on the avoidance of healthcare utilization during the global outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020. Data were collected through an online survey four weeks after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed the first case in South Korea; 1000 subjects were included in the analysis. The logit model for regression was used to analyze the associations between sociodemographic and health-related factors regarding the avoidance of healthcare utilization. Among the participants, 73.2% avoided healthcare utilization, and there was no significant difference in the prevalence of healthcare avoidance between groups with (72.0%) and without (74.9%) an underlying disease. Sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, income level, and residential area) were related to healthcare avoidance. Among the investigated influencing factors, residential areas highly affected by COVID-19 (i.e., Daegu/Gyeoungbuk region) had the most significant effect on healthcare avoidance. This study found a high prevalence of healthcare avoidance among the general population who under-utilized healthcare resources during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Despite over 29 million reported cases and over 900, 000 deaths worldwide as of September 2020, herd immunity and widespread vaccination efforts by many experts are expected to be insufficient in addressing this crisis for the foreseeable future. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatments that can lessen the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in patients who become seriously affected. Many viruses including HIV, the common cold, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use a unique mechanism known as ?1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (?1 PRF) to successfully replicate and infect cells in the human host. SARS-CoV (the coronavirus responsible for SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 possess a unique RNA structure, a three-stemmed pseudoknot, that stimulates ?1 PRF. Recent experiments identified that small molecules can be introduced as antiviral agents to bind with the pseudoknot and disrupt its stimulation of ?1 PRF. If successfully developed, small molecule therapy that targets ?1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 is an excellent strategy to improve patients prognoses. Crucial to developing these successful therapies is modeling the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 ?1 PRF pseudoknot. Following a structural alignment approach, we identify similarities in the ?1 PRF pseudoknots of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the original SARS-CoV, as well as a third coronavirus: MERS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In addition, we provide a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 ?1 PRF pseudoknot by comprehensively investigating the structural landscape using a hierarchical folding approach. Since understanding the impact of mutations is vital to long-term success of treatments that are based on predicted RNA functional structures, we provide insight on SARS-CoV-2 ?1 PRF pseudoknot sequence mutations and their effect on the resulting structure and its function.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot: Improved secondary structure prediction and detection of inter-viral structural similarity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the various innovative support strategies rendered by academic libraries in support of e-learning in Zimbabwean universities This was necessitated by the change in nature of learning and services provision in universities as a result of COVID-19 Despite the crisis caused by the pandemic, users of libraries still expect services to answer their information needs Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study was done to unpack the role of digital library services in supporting e-learning in universities in Zimbabwe An online questionnaire was developed using survey monkey and distributed to 50 professional librarians in both private and state universities in Zimbabwe A total of 34 librarians responded to the questionnaire and the data was analysed and presented thematically Data were presented using descriptive statistics in the form of figures Findings: The findings revealed that academic libraries play an important role in supporting e-learning in higher education institutions by providing electronic information resources, which are key in research, learning and teaching The libraries provide a one-stop shop for accessing electronic resources through the digital library Patrons have benefitted by accessing and using digital library services during the COVID-19 lockdown period It was also discovered that libraries should ensure that they are prepared to always offer their services despite the closure of physical buildings because of the pandemic Research limitations/implications: The study used an online questionnaire only as the data collection instrument, as it was the most suitable one to get data from librarians working from home and also because of the COVID-19 health guidance such as maintaining social distance The other methods were not used because of financial constraints Practical implications: This research showed the importance of digital services in e-learning environments, especially in developing countries The work revealed how university librarians in Zimbabwe are coming up with practical solutions in supporting e-learning in times of crisis The research therefore becomes handy for higher education institutions and authorities in crafting e-learning frameworks and positioning academic libraries at the centre of teaching, learning and research activities Social implications: This paper provides useful insights into how libraries can support learning especially during a pandemic The paper details how libraries support communities by offering correct and reliable information from scholarly information sources It also chronicles how libraries play an important part in the support of researchers in higher institutions in the fight against COVID-19 Originality/value: To the best of authors knowledge, this research is one of the first done in Zimbabwe on strategies that libraries are using in the COVID-19 era to support e-learning The findings presented in this study are helpful for higher and tertiary education authorities and other policymakers in improving e-learning and digital libraries ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"COVID-19: strategies for positioning the university library in support of e-learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection associated with multisystemic involvement including renal manifestations has been described in the literature.

Before discharge, congestion was assessed using a heart failure scoring system on the basis of Framingham criteria. Circulating levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, TGF--1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 1 and 2 were measured. Patients were divided into four groups according to the presence of CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m) and congestion (Framingham heart failure score 2). The primary end point was the combination of death and rehospitalisation for acute heart failure. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 32 months, 37 patients died and 14 were rehospitalised for acute heart failure. Patients with CKD and congestion had significantly higher TNF- (P = 0.037), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 1 (P = 0.0042) and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 2 (P = 0.001), lower TGF--1 (P = 0.02) levels, and the worst outcome (P < 0.0001).

Fluorescent angiography before performing anastomosis using ICG was successful in all 12 patients, and none required a change in position of the planned colon resection for anastomosis. The median signal-to-background ratios was 1.25 (IQR: 1.22C1.89). Across both centres, iatrogenic injury of the ureter was found in 0.4% of cases, and complications associated with anastomosis was found in 5.5% of cases. Conclusions: Our study showed a substantial opportunity for using two different fluorophores in colorectal surgery, whereby the visualisation of one will not change the possible quantification analysis of the other. Using two separate dyes during one procedure may help in optimisation of the fluorescent properties of both dyes when using them for different applications. Visualisation of different structures by different fluorophores seems to be the future of image-guided surgery, and shows progress in optical technologies used in image-guided surgery.","output":"Multispectral Imaging Using Fluorescent Properties of Indocyanine Green and Methylene Blue in Colorectal SurgeryInitial Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Body temperature is an important clinical marker used to screen for infections such as COVID-19. Previous studies have demonstrated individual variation in core body temperature with factors such as age, gender, circadian rhythm, menstruation, and energy expenditure;however, it is unknown whether ambient temperature affects the host ability to mount a fever. The possibility of a systematic change in body temperature during different seasons of the year has implications throughout healthcare. Using 100.4F as the cut-off for fever regardless of ambient temperature may result in poor sensitivity in screening for infections. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to four different hospitals for COVID-19 from 03/01/2020-02/28/2021. The 24-hour mean ambient temperature as well as the 72-hour mean ambient temperature was correlated with the percentage of patients who presented with fever. Fever was defined as maximum oral temperature greater than or equal to 100.4F within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Ambient temperature was stratified into deciles. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of ambient temperature with fever, controlling for demographics and comorbidities (congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, and liver disease). RESULTS: 5,275 patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 61 years, 49.7% (2622) were female, and the mortality rate was 8.7%. There was a linear relationship between the ambient temperature and the sensitivity of the 100.4F fever cut-off (i.e., the sensitivity to detect COVID-19 increased with increasing ambient temperature). In the coldest decile of ambient temperatures (<42.6F), only 13% of COVID-19 patients presented with a fever compared to 25% in the highest decile of ambient temperature (>79.8F). When controlling for demographics and comorbidities, the odds ratio of presenting with fever increased by 13% for every 10F increase in ambient temperature (OR 1.13, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ambient temperature affects the sensitivity of fever in detecting COVID-19, with increased sensitivity at higher ambient temperature. The one-size-fits-all fever cut-off may not adequately detect viral infections in different locations and climates. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that ambient temperature exposure should be taken into consideration when screening for infection. Lower cut-offs for fever may be required in screening patients during the winter season or in colder climates.

It has been implicated in host defense and cancer biology, but signaling mechanisms downstream of CD38 remain unclear. Mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson disease; it is also a risk factor for Crohn disease, leprosy, and certain types of cancers. The pathogenesis of these diseases involves inflammation and macroautophagy/autophagy, processes both CD38 and LRRK2 are implicated in. Here, we mechanistically and functionally link CD38 and LRRK2 as upstream activators of TFEB (transcription factor EB), a host defense transcription factor and the master transcriptional regulator of the autophagy/lysosome machinery. In B-lymphocytes and macrophages, we show that CD38 and LRRK2 exist in a complex on the plasma membrane. Ligation of CD38 with the monoclonal antibody clone 90 results in internalization of the CD38-LRRK2 complex and its targeting to the endolysosomal system. This generates an NAADP-dependent calcium signal, which requires LRRK2 kinase activity, and results in the downstream activation of TFEB. lrrk2 KO macrophages accordingly have TFEB activation defects following CD38 or LPS stimulation and fail to switch to glycolytic metabolism after LPS treatment. In overexpression models, the pathogenic LRRK2(G2019S) mutant promotes hyperactivation of TFEB even in the absence of CD38, both by stabilizing TFEB and promoting its nuclear translocation via aberrant calcium signaling. In sum, we have identified a physiological CD38-LRRK2-TFEB signaling axis in immune cells. The common pathogenic mutant, LRRK2(G2019S), appears to hijack this pathway.

Molecular mechanisms driving norovirus evolution are the accumulation of point mutations and recombination. Intragenotypic recombination has long been postulated to be a driving force of GII.4 noroviruses, the predominant genotype circulating in humans for over two decades. Increasingly, emergence and re-emergence of different intragenotype recombinants have been reported. The number and types of norovirus recombinants remained undefined until the 2007 Journal of General Virology research article 'Norovirus recombination' reported an assembly of 20 hitherto unclassified intergenotypic norovirus recombinant types. In the intervening decade, a host of novel recombinants has been analysed. New recombination breakpoints have been described, in vitro and in vivo studies supplement in silico analyses, and advances have been made in analysing factors driving norovirus recombination. This work presents a timely overview of these data and focuses on important aspects of norovirus recombination and its role in norovirus molecular evolution. An overview of intergenogroup, intergenotype, intragenotype and 'obligatory' norovirus recombinants as detected via in silico methods in the field is provided, enlarging the scope of intergenotypic recombinant types to 80 in total, and notably including three intergenogroup recombinants.

Related to the environmental bacterial contamination, 1400 samples were carried out on copper and control surfaces over three years after copper installation. In addition, some copper door handles were taken from the different facilities, and their specific activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was tested in vitro. In comparison to control surfaces, copper door handles and handrails revealed significantly lower contamination levels. This difference was observed in the five long-term care facilities and it persists through the three years of the study. High and extreme levels of bacterial contamination were less frequent on copper surfaces. Although, the antibacterial activity of copper surfaces against MRSA was lowered after three years of regular use, it was still significant as compared to inert control surfaces.

It is estimated that it affects more than two billion people worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where there is a reliance on low-cost food staples and where the diversity of the diet is limited. Finding a way to improve the nutritional quality of diets for the poorest people is central to meeting the UN sustainable development goals particularly sustainable development goal 2: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. As we pass the midpoint of the UN's Decade for Action on Nutrition, it is timely to reflect on progress towards achieving sustainable development goal 2 and the strategies to reduce hidden hunger.

A test-negative design case-control study enrolled randomly selected California residents who had received a test result for SARS-CoV-2 during February 18-December 1, 2021.

Incidence is higher compared to central and eastern Europe (27.3) and near similar to North America (34.5). Georgia is an Eastern European, middleincome country with 3.7 million residents and one of the highest numbers of active smokers in the European Region. The Georgian health care system is divided into a public and a private sector, with coverage of nearly 100% of the population. There is a national healthcare system as well as private insurance and all patients, irrespective of insurance (private or governmental) can choose the hospital for treatment by themselves all over the country. The Basic Package of the Universal Health Care Program includes the treatment of oncologic patients, specifically surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and radiotherapy and investigations and medications related to these procedures. The program covers all types of laboratory and instrumental investigations related to planned treatment. Georgia lacks an LC screening program for smokers and partially because of this, the majority of patients with lung cancer present at an advanced stage.

Therefore, knowledge about the effect of vaccination in this specific group is limited. This information is essential to empower lactating women to make a well-informed decision on their choice for vaccination. After natural infection, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are present in human milk, which might offer protection for her newborn. The dynamics of these antibodies in human milk following vaccination remain to be elucidated. RESEARCH AIM: To determine the effect of vaccination with BNT162b2 on the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in human milk. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal study, we included lactating women who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. Human milk samples were collected prior to vaccination and 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 days after both vaccine doses. Samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In total, 366 human milk samples from 26 lactating women were analyzed. A biphasic response was observed, with SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) starting to increase between day 5 and 7 after the first dose of the vaccine. After the second dose, an accelerated IgA antibody response was observed. CONCLUSION: After vaccination with the mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine, a SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response was observed in human milk. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA after vaccination is important as antibodies are transferred via human milk, and thereby might provide protection to infants against COVID-19.","output":"The Levels of SARS-CoV-2 Specific Antibodies in Human Milk Following Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Omsk hemorrhagic fever was first described in the early 1940s and is a natural focal infection, spread exclusively in four regions of Western Siberia and associated with muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). The etiological agent of this disease is the Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) which is closely related to the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and its range entirely lies within the TBEV area. OHFV belongs to the mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses and the ecological group of arboviruses. The problem concerning the origin of OHFV remains unresolved to date. This work analyzed all nucleotide sequences of the OHFV genome obtained in the present study and available in GenBank, including the E gene fragment and the amino acid sequences of the surface glycoprotein encoded by it. The conclusions, based on the clusteron approach, suggest that OHFV originated directly from the TBEV of the Far Eastern subtype due to the host-jump phenomenon, that is, through a rapid change from an arthropod host, Ixodes persulcatus, to a rodent, O. zibethicus. The muskrat was introduced to Western Siberia in the second half of the 1930s. The peculiarities of the biology and ecology of the muskrat in the new habitat became the reason for the TBEV cross-species transmission.

Purpose To evaluate the French national experience using Chest CT for COVID-19, results of chest CT and RT-PCR were compared together and with the final discharge diagnosis used as reference standard. Materials and Methods A structured CT scan survey (NCT04339686) was sent to 26 hospital radiology departments in France between March 2 and April 24 2020. These dates correspond to the peak of the national COVID-19 epidemic. Radiology departments were selected to reflect the estimated geographical prevalence heterogeneities of the epidemic. All symptomatic patients suspected of having a COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent within 48 hours both initial chest CT and at least one RT-PCR testing were included. The final discharge diagnosis, based on multiparametric items, was recorded. Data for each center were prospectively collected and gathered each week. Test efficacy was determined by using Mann-Whitney Test, Student's t-test, Chi-square test and Pearson's correlation. A p value <.05 determined statistical significance. Results Twenty-six of 26 hospital radiology departments responded to the survey with 7500 patients entered; 2652 did not have RT-PCR results or had unknown or excess delay between RT-PCR and CT. After exclusions, 4824 patients (mean age 64,  19 yrs, 2669 males) were included. Using final diagnosis as the reference, 2564 of the 4824 patients were positive for COVID-19 (53%). Sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of chest CT for diagnosing COVID-19 were 2319/2564 (90%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 89, 91), 2056/2260 (91%, 95%CI: 91, 92%), 2056/2300 (89%, 95%CI; 87, 90%) and 2319/2524 (92%, 95%CI 91, 93%) respectively.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate antibiotic prescribing practices in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an international web-based survey and investigated the pattern of antibiotic use as reported by physicians involved in treatment of COVID-19. SPSS Statistics version 25 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 166 participants from 23 countries and 82 different hospitals. Local guidelines for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients were reported by 61.8% (n = 102) of participants and for 82.9% (n = 136) they did not differ from local community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. Clinical presentation was recognized as the most important reason for the start of antibiotics (mean score = 4.07 and SD = 1.095 on grading scale from 1 to 5). When antibiotics were started, most respondents rated as the highest the need for coverage of atypical pathogens (mean score = 2.8 and SD = 0.99), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (mean score = 2.67 and SD = 1.05 on bi-modal scale, with values 1 and 2 for disagreement and values 3 and 4 for agreement). In the patients on the ward, 29.1% of respondents chose not to prescribe any antibiotic. Combination of ?-lactams and macrolides or fluoroquinolones was reported by 52.4% (n = 87) of respondents. In patients in the ICU, piperacillin/tazobactam was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic. The mean reported duration of antibiotic treatment was 7.12 (SD = 2.44) days. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed widespread broad-spectrum antibiotic use in patients with COVID-19.

including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing home setting without hospitalization Data from nine studies found hydroxychloroquine-based multidrug regimens were associated with a statistically significant &gt;60% reduction in mortality Going forward, we conclude that early empiric treatment for the elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with elderly residents/patients) has a reasonable probability of success and acceptable safety This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus prior to symptoms worsening Given the rapidity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of acute COVID-19 patients is a reasonable strategy to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death If elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing room type settings are allowed to worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from in-hospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of the lungs, kidneys etc The issue is timing of therapeutics, and we argue that early treatment before hospitalization, is the right time and can potentially save lives, especially among our higher-risk elderly populations hit hardest by severe illness and death from COVID-19 We must reiterate, we are talking about early treatment before the disease is far along in the disease sequelae where the patient needs hospitalization and aggressive interventions This early therapeutic option deserves serious and urgent consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers Doctors must be allowed their clinical discretion in how they optimally treat their patients We therefore hypothesize that early outpatient ambulatory treatment, once initiated as soon as symptoms begin in high-risk positive persons, would significantly reduce hospitalizations and prevent deaths Specifically, the provision of early multi-drug therapy with repurposed drugs will reduce hospitalization and death in elderly patients being cared for in long-term-care facilities The most important implications of our hypothesis are: 1) hospitalizations and deaths would be reduced 2) transmission would be reduced due to the mitigation of symptoms and 3) recovery following infection and treatment provides for natural exposure immunity that is broad, durable, and robust (helping towards natural immunity in the population) The end result is reduced

Protecting the physical and psychological health of HCWs is a key priority. This study assessed the perceptions of European hospital HCWs of local infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on their emotional wellbeing. MethodsWe performed two rounds of an international cross-sectional survey, between 31 March and 17 April 2020 via existing research networks (round 1), and between 14 May and 31 August 2020 via online convenience sampling (round 2). Main outcome measures were (1) behavioural determinants of HCW adherence with IPC procedures, (2) WHO-5 Well-Being Index, a validated scale of 0-100 reflecting emotional wellbeing. The WHO-5 was interpreted as a score below or above 50 points, a cut-off score used in previous literature to screen for depression. Results2,289 HCWs (round 1: n=190, round 2: n=2,099) from 40 countries in Europe participated. Mean age of respondents was 42 ({+/-}11) years, 66% were female, 47% and 39% were medical doctors and nurses, respectively. 74% (n=1699) of HCWs were directly treating patients with COVID-19, of which 32% (n=527) reported they were fearful of caring for these patients. HCWs reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 infection risk to themselves (71%) and their family (82%) as a result of their job. 40% of HCWs considered that getting infected with COVID-19 was not within their control. This was more common among junior than senior HCWs (46% versus 38%, P value <.01). Sufficient COVID-19-specific IPC training, confidence in PPE use and institutional trust were positively associated with the feeling that becoming infected with COVID-19 was within their control. Female HCWs were more likely than males to report a WHO-5 score below 50 points (aOR 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.8).

METHODS: We evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020. RESULTS: Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period.

We performed a retrospective observational analysis in a national cohort of 71 103 patients from all 32 states of Mexico from the National COVID-19 Epidemiological Surveillance Study. Two statistical models were applied through Cox regression to create survival models and logistic regression models to determine risk of death, hospitalisation, invasive mechanical ventilation, pneumonia and admission to an intensive care unit, conferred by obesity and other comorbidities (diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, immunosuppression, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease). Models were adjusted for other risk factors.

METHODS: Between July and September 2020, phone contact was made with every sixth unduplicated clinic in North Carolina listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration treatment locator (Na??=a??490 clinics). The response rate was 53%. RESULTS: Of the 128 clinics responding, 62 clinics (48%) failed to treat pregnant patients both before and during the pandemic, whereas 66 clinics (52%) accepted pregnant patients before the COVID-19 pandemic, with only 44 (66%) of these clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic.

We describe the epidemiological and laboratory data from one of the first such outbreaks in Ontario to assess factors associated with its severity, and the impact of progressive interventions for infection control over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We obtained line list and outbreak data from the public health unit to describe resident and staff cases, severity and distribution of cases over time and within the outbreak facility. Where available, we obtained data on laboratory specimens from the Public Health Ontario Laboratory and performed whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral specimens from the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 65 residents of the long-term care home, 61 (94%) contracted SARS-CoV-2, with a case fatality rate of 45% (28/61). Among 67 initial staff, 34 (51%) contracted the virus and none died. When the outbreak was declared, 12 staff, 2 visitors and 9 residents had symptoms. Resident cases were located in 3 of 4 areas of the home.

Analysis of total cellular RNA from HM175/18f infected FrhK4 cells by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and Northern blot hybridization revealed extensive degradation of both the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules. Similar degradation was observed when these cells were infected with Human coxsackievirus B1, a fast replicating enterovirus. In contrast, the parental strain of 18f, HM175/clone 1 did not induce RNA degradation. Inhibition of RNA degradation correlated with inhibition of virus replication. The pattern of rRNA degradation resembled degradation of rRNAs by RNase L, an enzyme activated in interferon-treated cells following infection with certain viruses. Ribosomal RNA degradation was accompanied by the reduction in the levels of several cellular RNAs including those for -actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, while the levels of c-myc and c-jun were higher. Interferon mRNAs could not be detected in either infected or mock-infected control cells, and STAT1, a key regulator of interferon action was not phosphorylated following virus infection.

Recent reports have shown that majority of the individuals recovered from COVID-19 have serious health complications, which is going to be a huge economic burden globally. Given the wide-spread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is almost impossible to test every individual in densely populated countries. Recent reports have shown that sewage-based surveillance can be used as holistic approach to understand the spread of the pandemic within a population or area. Here we have estimated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India, which is a home for nearly 10 million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard RT-PCR method. Interestingly, inlet samples of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets were negative, which indicates that the standard sewage treatment methods are efficient in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Based on the detected viral gene copies per litre and viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated.

We investigated the potential of photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect the presence of a spontaneous pulse during automated CPR in an animal study. METHODS Twelve anesthetized pigs were instrumented to monitor circulatory and respiratory parameters. Here we present the simultaneously recorded PPG and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, followed by 20 min of automated CPR and subsequent defibrillation. After defibrillation, pediatric-guidelines-style life support was given in cycles of 2 min. PPG and ABP waveforms were recorded during all stages of the protocol. Raw PPG waveforms were acquired with a custom-built photoplethysmograph controlling a commercial reflectance pulse oximetry probe attached to the nose. ABP was measured in the aorta. RESULTS In nine animals ROSC was achieved. Throughout the protocol, PPG and ABP frequency content showed strong resemblance. We demonstrate that (1) the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse during ventilation pauses, and that (2) frequency analysis of the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse and the determination of the pulse rate, even during ongoing chest compressions, if the pulse and compression rates are sufficiently distinct. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate the potential of PPG as a non-invasive means to detect pulse presence or absence, as well as pulse rate during CPR.","output":"Detection of a spontaneous pulse in photoplethysmograms during automated cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a porcine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic changed patient-physician interaction.

Some studies show that patients and providers hope telemedicine will continue after the crisis. In this study we evaluated benefits and challenges of telemedicine in our endocrinology clinic. Patients who had a telemedicine endocrinology visit after informed consent were surveyed on 10 questions regarding benefits and limitations of the tele visits compared to the clinic visit. Patient also responded if they want to continue with telehealth after COVID-19 pandemic. Providers also were surveyed about the benefits and limitations of telemedicine and responded if they want to continue with telemedicine after pandemic. We also analyzed no-show rate from January 2020 through May 2020 for 6 weeks before and after the implementation of telemedicine. Among 109 patients who were interviewed 65% declared that they would like to continue with telemedicine after pandemic. Total of 42% of patients prefer video visit and 37% prefer phone calls. Among Interviewers 45% report benefit of spending less time, however 54% stat the time of meeting, itself was about the same. 54% believe they spent less money with telemedicine. 37% of interviewers report no limitation for telehealth while 25% report connection difficulty. 63% of patients state they do not have any difficulty traveling to the hospital. 90% of the patients declare all their question and concerns were responded and 77% stated the quality of care with telemedicine is almost the same via clinic visit.

One of the solutions was to adapt the existing cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program in an institute to a remote approach offered by home-based telerehabilitation. The aim of this study was to measure the cardiorespiratory effects of telerehabilitation compared to conventional center-based CR. METHODS: Patients were assigned to two 3-week CR programs: telerehabilitation and conventional center-based CR. The telerehabilitation group wore a connected watch to monitor heart rate (HR) and gave their perception of effort according to a modified Borg scale. The exercise training (four sessions/week) consisted of 1-h aerobic endurance and strength training session at the target HR zone determined by results based on cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and perception of effort, respectively. The exercise protocol was the same for conventional CR participants except the duration of session that lasted 2 h instead of one. The week before and after the training program, peak oxygen uptake (VO(2) peak), oxygen uptake at first ventilatory threshold (VO(2) at VT(1)), peak workload, percent of predicted maximum HR, and the absolute differences in HR and systolic blood pressure between maximum and recovery at 1 and 3 min were measured using a CPET. A two-way ANOVA with one repeated measure and one independent factor was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (mean age: 61.5  8.6 years, 10 women) equally split in the two groups were included in this experiment. A significant increase was observed in both groups on VO(2) peak (telerehabilitation: 8.1  7.8% vs. conventional: 10.1  9.7%, p < 0.001), VO(2) at VT(1) (telerehabilitation: 8.8  4.4% vs. conventional: 7.3  19.0%, p = 0.02) and peak workload (telerehabilitation: 16.6  18.9% vs. conventional: 17.2  7.0%, p < 0.001) after the 3-week telerehabilitation and conventional CR, respectively. No significant difference was noticed between both groups. CONCLUSION: A 3-week exercise program improved patients cardiorespiratory fitness. Telerehabilitation was as effective and represents a safe alternative CR program during the COVID-19 period.

Thus, the ACE-AngII-AT1R axis positively regulates RAS. On the other hand, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to negatively regulate RAS by degrading AngII into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7). In the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by pulmonary hyperinflammation, the AngII-AT1R axis acts to exacerbate ARDS and the ACE2-AT2R axis acts protectively. More recently, ACE2 has been shown to be a receptor for SARS-CoV, the causative virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and SARS-CoV2, the causative virus of the 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Therefore, inhibition of the binding between ACE2 and virus spike protein is a drug discovery target for antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2. In addition, when SARS and COVID-19 become severe, ARDS with cytokine storm is occured. We reported that soluble ACE2 protein and microbial-derived ACE2 like enzyme suppress pulmonary hyperinflammation due to SARS and COVID-19, respectively. In addition, it has been reported that the ACE2-soluble protein has an effect of suppressing the establishment of infection by inhibiting the binding between SARS-CoV2 and the cell membrane surface ACE2.

Wireless endoscopy in contactless examinations promises to protect health care workers and reduce viral spread. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to introduce a contactless endoscopic diagnosis system using a wireless endoscope resembling a mask. METHODS: The Wi-FiCbased contactless mask endoscopy system comprises a disposable endoscope and a controller. First, the effective force applied by the tip during insertion was evaluated in a simple transoral model consisting of a force sensor on a simulated oropharynx wall. Second, the delay in video streaming was evaluated by comparing the frame rate and delays between a movement and its image over direct and Wi-Fi connections. Third, the system was applied to a detailed laryngopharyngeal tract phantom. RESULTS: The smartphone-controlled wireless endoscopy system was successfully evaluated. The mean, maximum, and minimum collision forces against the wall of the transoral model were 296 mN (30 gf), 363 mN (37 gf), and 235 mN (24 gf), respectively. The delay resulting from the wireless connection was 0.72 seconds. Using the phantom, an inexperienced user took around 1 minute to orient the endoscope to a desired area via the app. CONCLUSIONS: Device articulation does not pose a significant risk of laryngopharyngeal wall penetration, and latency does not significantly impede its use. Contactless wireless video streaming was successful within the access point range regardless of the presence of walls. The mask endoscope can be controlled and articulated wirelessly, minimizing contact between patients and device operators.

The total number of PED visits for allergic patients with respiratory or cutaneous symptoms dropped precipitously in 2020. It is very tricky to estimate whether it was a protective action of allergy or the fear of contagion or the lockdown or a reduction in air pollution that kept children with allergy from visiting the PED.

Individual brain activation patterns can be a valuable biomarker of neuroplasticity during the rehabilitation process and can result in improved personalized medicine for rehabilitation. The purpose of this systematic review is to explore the brain activation characteristics during walking post-stroke by determining: (1) if different components of gait (i.e., initiation/acceleration, steady-state, complex) result in different brain activations, (2) whether brain activations differ from healthy individuals. Six databases were searched resulting in 22 studies. Initiation/acceleration showed bilateral activation in frontal areas; steady-state and complex walking showed broad activations with the majority exploring and finding increases in frontal regions and some studies also showing increases in parietal activation. Asymmetrical activations were often related to performance asymmetry and were more common in studies with slower gait speed. Hyperactivations and asymmetrical activations commonly decreased with walking interventions and as walking performance improved. Hyperactivations often persisted in individuals who had experienced severe strokes. Only a third of the studies included comparisons to a healthy group: individuals post-stroke employed greater brain activation compared to young adults, while comparisons to older adults were less clear and limited.

Statistical analysis included descriptive analysis and in addition quantitative comparative analysis. Non-parametric tests were used for inferential statistical analysis. To understand whether usual mode of transportation has evolved due to COVID-19, Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was used to contrast factors influencing mode option prior to and throughout the time of COVID-19. RESULTS: Results explained that the major impact of COVID-19 on public transportation were social distancing and increase in the cost of transportation. There was a sharp decline in the use of para transit services with high occupancy such as trotro to the use of taxis. Commuters considered physical distancing, occupants wearing face masks, cleanliness of vehicle and safety from traffic accidents as essential factors influencing public transport mode choice during COVID-19.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is useful in evaluation of dyspneic patients. In prior studies, POCUS is often performed by ultrasound (US) teams without patient care responsibilities. OBJECTIVES This study evaluates the effectiveness of POCUS in narrowing diagnostic uncertainty in dyspneic patients when performed by treating EPs vs. separate US teams. METHODS This multicenter, prospective noninferiority cohort study investigated the effect of a POCUS performing team in patient encounters for dyspnea. Before-and-after surveys assessing medical decision-making were administered to attending physicians. Primary outcome was change in most likely diagnosis after POCUS. This was assessed for noninferiority between encounters where the primary or US team performed POCUS. Secondary outcomes included change in differential diagnosis, confidence in diagnosis, interventions considered, and image quality. RESULTS There were 156 patient encounters analyzed. In the primary team group, most likely diagnosis changed in 40% (95% confidence interval 28-52%) of encounters vs. 32% (95% confidence interval 22-41%) in the US team group. This was noninferior using an a priori specified margin of 20% (p < .0001). Post-POCUS differential decreased by a mean 1.8 diagnoses and was equivalent within a margin of 0.5 diagnoses between performing teams (p = 0.034). Other outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSION POCUS performed by primary teams was noninferior to POCUS performed by US teams for changing the most likely diagnosis, and equivalent when considering mean reduction in number of diagnoses.

Typical populations at risk include hematologic cancer patients on chemotherapy, bone marrow and solid organ transplant patients, and patients on immunosuppressive medications. Invasive lung disease due to molds is challenging to definitively diagnose based on clinical features and imaging findings alone, as these methods are nonspecific. Etiologic laboratory testing is limited to insensitive culture techniques, non-specific and not readily available PCR, and tissue biopsies, which are often difficult to obtain and impact on the clinical fragility of patients. Microbiologic/mycologic analysis has limited sensitivity and may not be sufficiently timely to be actionable. Due to the inadequacy of current diagnostics, clinicians should consider a combination of diagnostic modalities to prevent morbidity in patients with mold pneumonia. Diagnosis of IMIs requires improvement, and the availability of noninvasive methods such as fungal biomarkers, microbial cell-free DNA sequencing, and metabolomics-breath testing could represent a new era of timely diagnosis and early treatment of mold pneumonia.","output":"Diagnosis of Pneumonia Due to Invasive Molds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the many types of malicious codes, ransomware poses a major threat. Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker's RSA private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware.

Drug-based inference methods for drug repositioning apply some unique features of drugs for new indication prediction. Complementary information is provided by these different features. It is therefore necessary to integrate these features for more accurate in silico drug repositioning. RESULTS: In this study, we collect 3 different types of drug features (i.e., chemical, genomic and pharmacological spaces) from public databases. Similarities between drugs are separately calculated based on each of the features. We further develop a fusion method to combine the 3 similarity measurements. We test the inference abilities of the 4 similarity datasets in drug repositioning under the guilt-by-association principle. Leave-one-out cross-validations show the integrated similarity measurement IntegratedSim receives the best prediction performance, with the highest AUC value of 0.8451 and the highest AUPR value of 0.2201. Case studies demonstrate IntegratedSim produces the largest numbers of confirmed predictions in most cases. Moreover, we compare our integration method with 3 other similarity-fusion methods using the datasets in our study. Cross-validation results suggest our method improves the prediction accuracy in terms of AUC and AUPR values. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the 3 drug features used in our manuscript are valuable information for drug repositioning. The comparative results indicate that integration of the 3 drug features would improve drug-disease association prediction.

METHODS The direct costs for patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy during the learning curve (group A) and after the attainment of proficiency by two colorectal surgeons performing the procedure (group B) between 2001 and 2007 were compared. The learning curve was defined as the first 40 laparoscopic colectomy cases for each surgeon. The distribution of cases for the surgeons ensured that cost-related differences were not influenced by lead time bias of cases performed during the learning curve. RESULTS The study involved 80 group A and 74 group B patients. Groups A and B were similar in terms of age (P = 0.7), gender (P = 0.5), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (P = 0.5), body mass index (P = 0.3), diagnosis (P = 0.8), previous abdominal surgery (P = 0.07), and comorbidity (P = 0.4). The two groups also were similar with regard to performance of anastomosis (P = 0.2) or resection (P = 0.6), conversion to open surgery (P = 0.7), postoperative morbidity (P = 0.6), readmission (P = 0.1), reoperation rate (P = 0.6), and hospital length of stay (P = 0.6). The operation time was significantly longer for group A (P = 0.01). The total direct costs (P = 0.7) and the operating room (P = 0.6), nursing (P = 0.7), pharmacy (P = 0.9), radiology (P = 1), and professional (P = 0.051) costs were however similar between the two groups.

We review the referral and listing criteria for some common pulmonary diseases and also cite the updated literature surrounding the absolute and relative contraindications keeping in mind that they are a constantly moving target. Frailty and psychosocial barriers are difficult to assess with the current assessment tools but continue to impact posttransplant outcomes. Finally, we discuss the limited data on transplantation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID19 as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridge to transplantation.

To date, however, no published studies have assessed the effect of testosterone therapy on COVID-19 outcomes in older men. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether testosterone therapy reduced disease progression in older men diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nested within a national cohort of older (aged 50 years) male patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and July 1, 2021 from the Optum electronic health record COVID-19 database, two matched case-control studies of COVID-19 outcomes were conducted. Cases-defined, respectively, as persons who (a) were hospitalized 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis (n = 33,380), and (b) were admitted to the intensive care unit or received mechanical ventilation during their COVID-19 hospitalization (n = 10,273)-were matched 1:1 with controls based on demographic and clinical factors. EXPOSURES: Testosterone therapy was defined based on receipt of prescription at 60, 90, or 120 days before COVID-19 diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and intensive care unit admission/mechanical ventilation during COVID-19 hospitalization. RESULTS: The use of testosterone therapy was not associated with decreased odds of hospitalization (60 days: OR = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70-1.20; 90 days: OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.68-1.13; 120 days: OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.72-1.32) or intensive care unit admission/mechanical ventilation (60 days: OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.37-1.23; 90 days: OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.36-0.11; 120 days: OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.29-1.19).

The medicalization (diagnosis, therapy and follow up) of the lack of fertility is frequently a challenge in term of personal and couples involvement. In particular, while the Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) has allowed many infertile couples to achieve pregnancy, the therapeutic process faced by the couple bears a strong psychological stress that can affect the couple's quality of life, relationship and sexuality. Despite infertility affects both female and male sexual health, only recently the interest in the effects of ART on the couple's sexuality has grown, especially for women. METHODS: A literature research on the sexual dysfunction in fertility care and particularly in ART setting was performed. RESULTS: Literature largely found that intimacy and sexuality appear specifically impaired by intrusiveness of treatments and medical prescriptions. Moreover, there is a close relationship between emotional, psychological and sexual aspects, which can be integrated in the new concept of Inferto-Sex Syndrome (ISS) that can impair the ART treatment outcomes. Evidence demonstrates that the assessment of sexual function is necessary in couples undergoing diagnosis of infertility and ART. CONCLUSION: A close relationship between infertility and sexuality, both in the female and male partners, was detected. ART treatments may heavily impact on the couple's psychosexual health. A couple-centred program for the integrated management of psychological and sexual dysfunction should be considered in the context of ART programs.","output":"The Inferto-Sex Syndrome (ISS): sexual dysfunction in fertility care setting and assisted reproduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The interaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates cell invasion.

Although definitive management involves tube exchange, if direct visualization is possible temporizing measures can often be considered. Unplanned extubation confers variable and context-specific risks depending on patient anatomy and physiological status. Because risk factors for unplanned extubation are well established, bundled interventions can be employed for mitigation. Tracheostomy tube dislodgement accounts for a substantial proportion of death and disability related to airway management in critical care settings.

We aimed to investigate the association between antihypertensive agent exposure and in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study on patients hospitalized between February 1 and May 15, 2020. All patients had been followed up for at least 30 days. RESULTS: Of the 8078 hospitalized patients for Covid-19, 3686 (45.6%) had hypertension and were included in the study. In this population, the median age was 75.4 (IQR, 21.5) years and 57.1% were male. Overall in-hospital 30-day mortality was 23.1%. The main antihypertensive pharmacological classes used were calcium channel blockers (CCB) (n=1624, 44.1%), beta-blockers (n=1389, 37.7%), ARB (n=1154, 31.3%), and ACEi (n=998, 27.1%). The risk of mortality was lower in CCB (aOR, 0.83 [0.70-0.99]) and beta-blockers (aOR, 0.80 [0.67-0.95]) users and non-significant in ARB (aOR, 0.88 [0.72-1.06]) and ACEi (aOR, 0.83 [0.68-1.02]) users, compared to non-users. These results remain consistent for patients receiving CCB, beta-blocker, or ARB as monotherapies. CONCLUSION: This large multicenter retrospective of Covid-19 patients with hypertension found a reduced mortality among CCB and beta-blockers users, suggesting a putative protective effect. Our findings did not show any association between the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and the risk of in-hospital death.

The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients receiving an allogenic blood transfusion of packed red blood cells from the day of surgery until hospital discharge (or until D30 if patient is still hospitalised). Enrolment started on March 2017 in 11 French hospitals. The study was stopped between July 2017 and August 2018 (because of investigation of serious AEs with IIM in Spain) and slowed down since March 2020 (COVID-19 crisis).

We collected demographic data, medical and treatment history, comorbidities, symptoms, date of onset, and severity of Covid-19 infection, neurological and psychiatric symptoms, neurological and psychiatric examination data and, when available, results from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, brain magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging, 18-fluorodesoxyglucose-position emission computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT)), electroencephalography (EEG) and electroneuromyography (ENMG). Results: 245 patients were included in the analysis. One-hundred fourteen patients (47%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 10 (4%) died. The most frequently reported neuropsychiatric symptoms were motor deficit (41%), cognitive disturbance (35%), impaired consciousness (26%), psychiatric disturbance (24%), headache (20%) and behavioral disturbance (18%). The most frequent syndromes diagnosed were encephalopathy (43%), critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (26%), isolated psychiatric disturbance (18%), and cerebrovascular disorders (16%). No patients showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in their CSF. Encephalopathy was associated with greater age and higher risk of death. Critical illness neuromyopathy was associated with an extended stay in the ICU.

METHODS: We analysed data, including open-text responses, from an online survey conducted in JuneCJuly 2020 with a convenience sample of 2005 16C24-year-olds living in Scotland. RESULTS: Among those who used condoms and contraception, one quarter reported that COVID-19 mitigation measures had made a difference to their access or use. Open-text responses revealed a landscape of disrupted prevention, including changes to sexual risk-taking and preventive practices, unwanted contraceptive pathways, unmet need for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, and switches from freely provided to commercially sold condoms and contraception. Pandemic-related barriers to accessing free condoms and contraception included: (1) uncertainty about the legitimacy of accessing SRH care and self-censorship of need; (2) confusion about differences between SRH care and advice received from healthcare professionals during the pandemic compared with routine practice; and (3) exacerbation of existing access barriers, alongside reduced social support and resources to navigate SRH care. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging barriers to STI and pregnancy prevention within the context of COVID-19 have the potential to undermine positive SRH practices, and widen inequalities, among young people.

It is documented that the virus can be transmitted to newborn babies from their mothers. We consider a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of the Zika virus infectious disease that spreads in, both humans and vectors, through horizontal and vertical transmission. The total populations of both humans and mosquitoes are assumed to be constant. Our models consist of a system of eight differential equations describing the human and vector populations during the different stages of the disease. We have included the hospitalization/isolation class in our model to see the effect of the controlling strategy. We determine the expression for the basic reproductive number R(0) in terms of horizontal as well as vertical disease transmission rates. An in-depth stability analysis of the model is performed, and it is consequently shown, that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number R(0) < 1. It is also shown that when R(0) > 1, there exists a unique endemic equilibrium. We showed that the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable when it exists. We were able to prove this result in a reduced model. Furthermore, we conducted an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to recognize the impact of crucial model parameters on R(0). The uncertainty analysis yields an estimated value of the basic reproductive number R(0) = 1.54. Assuming infection prevalence in the population under constant control, optimal control theory is used to devise an optimal hospitalization/isolation control strategy for the model.

However, it is unclear how C. elegans responds to prenol. By utilizing natural variation and genetic neuron ablation to investigate the response of C. elegans to prenol, we found that the AWC neurons are involved in the detection of prenol and that several genes (including dcap-1, dcap-2, and clec-39) influence response to this odorant. Furthermore, we identified that the response to prenol is mediated by the canonically proposed pathway required for other AWC-sensed attractants. However, upon testing genetically diverse isolates, we found that the response of some strains to prenol differed from their response to isoamyl alcohol (IAA), suggesting that the pathways mediating response to these two odorants may be genetically distinct. Further, evaluations leveraging natural variation and genome wide association revealed specific genes that influence nematode behavior and provide a foundation for future studies to better understand the role of prenol in nematode behavioral ecology.","output":"Signaling by AWC Olfactory Neurons Is Necessary for Caenorhabditis elegans' Response to Prenol, an Odor Associated with Nematode-Infected Insects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe two established STEM camps that went virtual following the outbreak of COVID-19 during the summer of 2020.

AIM: We compared the role of mobility during the first and second COVID-19 wave in Switzerland by studying the link between daily travel distances and the effective reproduction number (R(t) ) of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We used aggregated mobile phone data from a representative panel survey of the Swiss population to measure human mobility. We estimated the effects of reductions in daily travel distance on R(t) via a regression model. We compared mobility effects between the first (2 MarchC7 April 2020) and second wave (1 OctoberC10 December 2020). RESULTS: Daily travel distances decreased by 73% in the first and by 44% in the second wave (relative to February 2020). For a 1% reduction in average daily travel distance, R(t) was estimated to decline by 0.73% (95% credible interval (CrI): 0.34C1.03) in the first wave and by 1.04% (95% CrI: 0.66C1.42) in the second wave.

Effective market segmentation improves the communication and efficacy of health advice. Travel frequency is an important basis for health-related consumer segmentation, as it is closely related to risk of greater exposure to infectious diseases. Theoretically grounded studies of tourist biosecurity behavior and travel frequency have largely been neglected, although insights into practices and attitudes are especially relevant for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) health responses. Therefore, this research constructed and tested a conceptual model applying Value-Attitude-Behavior theory to US travelers to see whether the frequency of international travel affected tourist COVID-19 related biosecurity behavior. US respondents were drawn from a panel using a quota sampling technique according to the age and gender of American outbound tourists. An online survey was administered in September 2020. The responses (n = 395) of those who traveled internationally within five years were analyzed utilizing partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with multi-group analysis. Travel frequency significantly affects biosecurity behavior. High travel frequency (&gt;=8 trips) has the strongest effect of value on biosecurity attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and biosecurity social norms, leading to biosecurity behaviors. Biosecurity behaviors pertaining to medium travel frequency (4-7 trips) are significantly influenced by personal norms.

Immunosuppression reduction and interferon treatment may result in antibody-mediated rejection. COVID-19, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and cyclosporine may play a combined role in the development of posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome. In conclusion, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, antibody-mediated rejection, and posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome may represent a continuum of 3 thrombotic microangiopathy conditions fostered by interplay between the COVID-19 infection and the treatment modalities for COVID-19 management in this patient.","output":"Thrombotic Microangiopathy, Antibody-Mediated Rejection, and Posterior Reversible Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome in a Liver Transplant Recipient: Interplay Between COVID-19 and Its Treatment Modalities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 is the disease produced by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, which is introduced into the host's cell thanks to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Once there, it uses the cell's machinery to multiply itself. In this process, it generates an immune response that stimulates the lymphocytes to produce cytokines and reactive oxygen species that begin to deteriorate the endothelial cell. Complement activation, through the complement attack complex and C5a, contributes to this endothelial damage. The different mediators further promote the expression of adhesion molecules on the endothelial surface, which encourages all blood cells to adhere to the endothelial surface to form small conglomerates, called clots, which obstruct the lumen of the small blood vessels. Furthermore, the mediators of clot lysis are inhibited. All this promotes a prothrombotic environment within the pulmonary capillaries that is reflected in the elevation of D-dimer. The only solution for this cascade of events seems to be the implementation of an effective anticoagulation protocol that early counteracts the changes induced by thrombi in the pulmonary circulation and reflected in the functioning of the right ventricle.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019-induced hypercoagulability and its clinical implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have been increasingly used in smart city applications, such as location-based and proximity-based services, to enable Internet of Things to interact with people in vicinity or enhance context-awareness.

This report describes the geographic distribution of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and related deaths reported by each U.S. state, each territory and freely associated state,* DC, and NYC during February 12-April 7, 2020, and estimates cumulative incidence for each jurisdiction. In addition, it projects the jurisdiction-level trajectory of this pandemic by estimating case doubling times on April 7 and changes in cumulative incidence during the most recent 7-day period (March 31-April 7). As of April 7, 2020, a total of 395,926 cases of COVID-19, including 12,757 related deaths, were reported in the United States. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence varied substantially by jurisdiction, ranging from 20.6 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 915.3 in NYC. On April 7, national case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, although this ranged from 5.5 to 8.0 days in the 10 jurisdictions reporting the most cases. Absolute change in cumulative incidence during March 31-April 7 also varied widely, ranging from an increase of 8.3 cases per 100,000 in Minnesota to 418.0 in NYC. Geographic differences in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, cumulative incidence, and changes in incidence likely reflect a combination of jurisdiction-specific epidemiologic and population-level factors, including 1) the timing of COVID-19 introductions; 2) population density; 3) age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions among COVID-19 patients (1-3); 4) the timing and extent of community mitigation measures; 5) diagnostic testing capacity; and 6) public health reporting practices.

We inspected five amounts of each of whole-blood, buccal swabs, and tail-hair follicles in nine camels, both qualitatively via gel electrophoresis and quantitatively using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. We also tested the effects of long term-storage on the quality and quantity of DNA, and measured the rate of degradation, by analyzing three buccal swab samples and 30 tail-hair follicles over a period of nine months. Good quality DNA, in the form of visible large size DNA bands, was extracted from all three sources, for all five amounts. The five volumes of whole-blood samples (20C100l) provided ~0.4C3.6 g, the five quantities of buccal swabs (1C5) produced ~0.1C12 g, while the five amounts of tail-hair follicles (10C50) resulted in ~0.7C25 g. No differences in the rate of degradation of buccal swab and tail-hair follicle DNA were detected, but there was clearly greater deterioration in the quality of DNA extracted from buccal swabs when compared to tail-hair follicles. We recommend using tail-hair samples for camel DNA biobanking, because it resulted in both an adequate quality and quantity of DNA, along with its ease of collection, transportation, and storage.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine this hypothesis using a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: We conducted a two-sample MR study using GWAS summary statistics data of the UK Biobank. We applied genetically predicted serum albumin as a primary exposure measure and serum total protein as a secondary exposure measure. The outcome measure was the Rockwood frailty index (FI) based on 49 deficits from 356,432 individuals (53.3% of them were women, with a mean  SD age of 56.7  8.0 y. The association between serum protein measures and FI was mainly analyzed by use of the inverse variance weighted method. RESULTS: A genetically predicted serum albumin concentration was not statistically significantly associated with FI in the full sample. However, in women, we observed a preventive association between genetically predicted serum albumin and FI ( = ?0.172 per g/L; 95% CI: ?0.336, ?0.007; P = 0.041). In the full sample, genetically predicted serum total protein was inversely associated with FI (: ?0.153 per g/L; 95% CI: ?0.251, ?0.056; P = 0.002). In both women and men, higher serum total protein was significantly inversely associated with FI; regression coefficients were ?0.148 per g/L (95% CI: ?0.287, ?0.009; P = 0.037) for women, ?0.154 per g/L (95% CI: ?0.290, ?0.018; P = 0.027) for men.

Data on changes in the physical and chemical properties of each of them were collected in order to evaluate the possibilities of material (mechanical) recycling. A thermobalance was used to look for differences in the thermal decomposition of the plastics during this time. In addition, the mechanical properties of each plastic were studied. Results showed that both thermal and mechanical properties were affected, causing a weakening of the material which became less elastic and more rigid. Furthermore, SEM and AFM images were obtained: they showed cracks, flakes and granular oxidation as well as a loss of homogeneity on the surface of the samples. These changes make mechanical recycling unfeasible, since the quality of the recycled material is insufficient to ensure a high virgin material substitution rate.","output":"Recyclability of four types of plastics exposed to UV irradiation in a marine environment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The six Gulf monarchies are major stakeholders in the global energy system.

System analytics (N = 129) and survey data (N = 42) were collected from students alongside qualitative data from semi-structured interviews (N = 8). We found that students value lecture capture highly, but do not access it extensively during the teaching period. The availability of transcripts and closed captions did not impact the amount of capture use or performance on MCQ tests, but did result in more positive perceptions of capture, including increased likelihood of recommending it to others. The use of email reminders referring students to specific segments of capture and reminding them of the functionality had no impact on any measure, although qualitative data suggested that the content of reminders may be used in revision rather than during the teaching period, which fell outside the period we investigated.

STUDY DESIGN: It is a questionnaire\\\\based study. METHODS: A web\\\\based questionnaire was prepared, and 400 parents from four districts of Punjab, India, namely, Ludhiana, Sahibzada Ajit Singh (SAS) Nagar, Sangrur and Ferozepur, were telephonically interviewed. Further, the information collected from the interviews was statistically analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed that 73.15% and 51.25% of the children were having signs of increased irritation and anger, respectively; 18.7% and 17.6% of the parents also mentioned the symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively, among their children, which were also augmented by the changes in their diet, sleep, weight and more usage of the electronic equipment.

In this study, we aim to identify factors associated with headache in COVID-19 and headache characteristics. METHODS This case-control study includes COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pneumonia during March 2020. Controls comprise COVID-19 patients without headache and cases, COVID-19 patients with headache. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical records. Headache characteristics were evaluated by semi-structured telephonic interview after discharge. RESULTS Of a total of 379 COVID-19 patients, 48 (13%) developed headache. Among these, 30 (62%) were men and the median age was 57.9 (47-73) years. Headache was associated with younger age, less comorbidities and reduced mortality, as well as with low levels of C-Reactive Protein, mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oropharyngeal symptoms. A logistic multiple regression model revealed that headache was directly associated with D-dimer and creatinine levels, the use of high flow nasal cannula and arthromyalgia, while urea levels, beta-lactamic treatment and hypertension were negatively associated with headache. COVID-19-associated headache characteristics were available in 23/48 (48%) patients. Headache was the onset symptom in 8/20 (40%), of mild or moderate intensity in 17/20 (85%) patients, with oppressive characteristics in 17/18 (94%) and holocranial 8/19 (42%) or temporal 7/19 (37%) localization.

This review will outline technological responses to this need and the analytical considerations required for their translation to routine use. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic solutions directly detect the virus or measure host-derived surrogate markers of infection. With pressure upon supply chains for the 'traditional' molecular approaches, a wide variety of analytical tools spanning the molecular, serology, imaging and chemistry space are being developed, including high throughput solutions and simplified near-patient formats. SUMMARY: The unique genetic nature of SARS-CoV-2 means high analytical specificity is achievable by most diagnostic formats. However, clinical sensitivity assessment is complicated by wide discrepancies in analytical range and challenges associated with standardising these differences. When coupled with the acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported precise metrics of test performance must be questioned. The response to SARS-CoV-2 has delivered considerable diagnostic innovation, but for a technology to be maximised, it must be demonstrably reproducible and fit for purpose. If novel diagnostic solutions for SARS-CoV-2 are to succeed, equally innovative mechanisms are needed to ensure widespread clinical and surveillance application, enabling agreed standards and metrics to ensure comparability.","output":"COVID-19 new diagnostics development: novel detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 infection and considerations for their translation to routine use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented obstacles for new investigators to traverse.

METHODS: The current study is conducted in a high volume tertiary obstetrics center burdened by COVID-19 pandemics, in Turkey. In this cohort study, perinatal outcomes and complete blood count indices performed at the time of admission of 39 pregnancies (Study group) complicated by COVID-19 were compared with 69 uncomplicated pregnancies (Control group). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies with COVID-19 compared to data of healthy pregnancies, except the increased C-section rate (p=0.026). Monocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were significantly increased (p<0.0001, p=0.009, p=0.043, p<0.0001, respectively) whereas the MPV and plateletcrit were significantly decreased (p=0.001, p=0.008) in pregnants with COVID-19. ROC analysis revealed that the optimal cut-off value for MLR was 0.354 which indicated 96.7% specificity and 59.5% sensitivity in diagnosis of pregnant women with COVID-19. A strong positive correlation was found between the MLR and the presence of cough symptom (r=41.4, p=<0.0001).

RESULTS: Using influenza antiviral drug resistance mutations as an example by employing the utility of synthetic paired long oligonucleotides containing complementary sequences at their 3' ends and utilizing the formation of oligonucleotide dimers and DNA polymerization, we generated ~170bp dsDNA containing several known specific neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance mutations. These templates were further cloned and successfully applied as positive controls in downstream assays. CONCLUSION: This approach significantly improved the development of diagnosis of resistance mutations in terms of time, accuracy, efficiency and sensitivity, which are paramount to monitoring the emergence and spread of antiviral drug resistant influenza strains.

Beliefs and attitudes of clinicians have the potential to shape clinical research involving pregnant women. This study evaluates the current perspectives of Canadian physicians on the participation of pregnant women in COVID-19 clinical trials. Methods An anonymous 22-item online questionnaire was sent to Canadian physicians belonging to four Canadian professional associations. Physicians were surveyed regarding the inclusion of pregnant women in COVID-19 trials using a semi-quantitative approach with multiple choice and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were performed. Themes from free-text answers were extracted using a semi-inductive approach. Results 202 physicians agreed to participate, 168 of which completed the survey. The majority of respondents expressed support for including pregnant women in COVID-19 trials (119/165; 72%), especially those investigating therapies with a prior safety record in pregnancy (139/164; 85%). In addition, 66% (107/161) of physicians responded that including pregnant women in COVID-19 trials was urgent. The main barriers to including pregnant women in COVID-19 trials were perceived unwillingness of pregnant patients to take part in clinical trials, perceived unwillingness of treating teams to offer participation, burden of regulatory approval, and a general culture of exclusion of pregnant women from clinical trials.

The aim of this study was to understand the extent to which the pandemic has impacted the demand and usage of unrelated donors and cord blood units (CBUs) at Canadian Blood Services (CBS). MATERIALS AND METHODS Data regarding stem cell donor interest and product usage for unrelated allogeneic HCT were retrieved from the database at CBS using de-identified anonymous information. RESULTS Unrelated donor searches for Canadian patients remained unchanged by the pandemic, reflecting stable demand. The number of unrelated allogeneic transplants performed within Canada also remained stable, while the number of cord blood transplants increased, chiefly for paediatric patients. Requests for donor verification typing, a first signal of potential interest, increased from domestic centres during the first 6 months of the pandemic and decreased from international centres, before returning to baseline levels. The proportion of transplants for Canadian patients who used stem cell products procured from Canadian donors increased between 3 and 6 months after the start of the pandemic before returning to baseline and appears to be increasing again more than 1 year after the start of the pandemic. Use of CBUs for Canadian paediatric patients increased and remains elevated. CONCLUSION Demand for unrelated adult HCT donors has remained stable despite the evolving pandemic with a transient and recurring increased interest and usage of domestic adult donors. Use of CBUs for paediatric patients has increased and remains elevated. Registries and donor collection centres should maintain the capacity to expand services for domestic donor collection during pandemics to offset threats to international donor usage.","output":"Demand and usage of unrelated donor products for allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A Canadian Blood Services Stem Cell Registry analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can lead to massive inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract causing severe clinical symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 infects lungs after binding its spike proteins with alveolar angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it also triggers inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2 invades the gastrointestinal tract by interacting with Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) that induces the expression of ACE2. The influx of ACE2 facilitates cellular binding of more SARS-CoV-2 and causes massive gastrointestinal inflammation leading to diarrhea. Diarrhea prior to COVID-19 infection or COVID-19-induced diarrhea reportedly ends up in a poor prognosis for the patient. Flavonoids are part of traditional remedies for gastrointestinal disorders. Preclinical studies show that flavonoids can prevent infectious diarrhea. Recent studies show flavonoids can inhibit the multiplication of SARS-CoV-2. In combination with vitamin D, flavonoids possibly activate nuclear factor erythroid-derived-2-related factor 2 that downregulates ACE2 expression in cells.

Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging findings. RESULTS: Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index ( = ?0.657, P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65  13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and confirmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05).

An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered riskCbenefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided.

One-third of patients hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 develops macrovascular thrombotic complications, including venous thromboembolism, myocardial injury/infarction and stroke. Concurrently, the autopsy series indicate multiorgan damage pattern consistent with microvascular injury. PROPHYLAXIS, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT: COVID-19 associated coagulopathy has distinct features, including markedly elevated D-dimers concentration with nearly normal activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and platelet count. The diagnosis may be challenging due to overlapping features between pulmonary embolism and severe COVID-19 disease, such as dyspnoea, high concentration of D-dimers, right ventricle with dysfunction or enlargement, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both macro- and microvascular complications are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Therefore, early recognition of coagulation abnormalities among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are critical measures to identify patients with poor prognosis, guide antithrombotic prophylaxis or treatment, and improve patients' clinical outcomes. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICIANS: Most of the guidelines and consensus documents published on behalf of professional societies focused on thrombosis and hemostasis advocate the use of anticoagulants in all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as 2-6 weeks post hospital discharge in the absence of contraindications. However, since there is no guidance for deciding the intensity and duration of anticoagulation, the decision-making process should be made in individual-case basis. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we review the mechanistic relationships between inflammation and thrombosis, discuss the macrovascular and microvascular complications and summarize the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of thromboembolism in patients affected by COVID-19.","output":"Thrombotic Complications in Patients with COVID-19: Pathophysiological Mechanisms, Diagnosis, and Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Clinical and analytical data on patients suffering from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) indicate that endothelial damage plays a key role in the pathophysiology of the disease and is responsible for the pulmonary complications and the thrombotic microangiopathy affecting multiple organs, which contribute directly to mortality (Ackerman et al. N Engl J Med 2020). Detection of biomarkers of endothelial injury in circulating blood may provide critical diagnostic and prognostic information on the disease course (Goshua et al. Lancet Haematology 2020). Endothelial injury is also a cornerstone of pathobiology in other septic and potentially life-threatening inflammatory syndromes. Objectives: To identify circulating markers of endothelial damage in COVID-19 patients, and compare their levels with those observed in other septic syndromes. Methods: Plasma samples from non-critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (positive nasopharyngeal swab and confirmatory radiological chest imaging) requiring admission (n=42) were collected during the first 36h of hospitalization. Endothelial damage was evaluated by measuring in plasma: i) markers of endothelial function and activation (sVCAM-1, VWF, ADAMTS-13 activity, Protein C and 2-antiplasmin as a marker of fibrinolysis); ii) heparan sulfate (HS) levels, as indicators of endothelial glycocalyx degradation and loss of endothelial barrier function; and iii) C5b9 deposits on endothelial cells in culture, and soluble C5b9 (sC5b9) levels, to measure complement activation. Circulating dsDNA was analyzed as an indicator of the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). ELISA tests were used for sVCAM-1, Protein C, HS, and sC5b9 levels. ADAMTS-13 activity was evaluated by FRETS. VWF, Protein C, and 2-antiplasmin were measured at the Atellica COAG 360 (Siemens Healthineers). C5b9 deposits were assessed by immunofluorescence and dsDNA levels by Quant-iT PicoGreen assay kit. Results were compared with those obtained in healthy donors (controls, n=45), and patients with non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NI-SIRS, n=8) and septic shock (SS, n=8). Results: Levels of sVCAM-1 were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients vs. controls, NI-SIRS and SS (15912 vs. 794, 578 and 8010 ng/mL, respectively, p<0.005) (MeanSDM). VWF was elevated in COVID-19 patients vs. controls (24026 vs. 965%, p<0.001), with similar values in NI-SIRS (27140%), and significantly reduced vs. SS (47643%, p<0.001). HS levels in COVID-19 patients were twice those detected in controls (1669174 vs. 83936 ng/mL, p=0.001), but they did not differ from those in NI-SIRS (1372368 ng/mL), and were significantly lower than in SS (3677880 ng/mL, p<0.001 vs COVID-19). Regarding complement activation, deposits of C5b9 on endothelial cells were significantly increased vs. controls (2-fold, p<0.01), with no notable differences vs. NI-SIRS (31-fold) and significantly lower than in SS (82-fold, p<0.001). Remarkably, sC5b9 levels were much more elevated in COVID-19 patients (1064120 vs. 20411 ng/mL, p<0.001), and no significant differences were observed vs. NI-SIRS (902160 ng/mL) or SS (958180 ng/mL). Also of note, presence of NETs was significantly elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 patients vs. controls (161.3 vs. 20.3 ng/ml, p<0.001), but similar to NI-SIRS (195 ng/mL) and clearly inferior to SS (336 ng/mL, p<0.001) (Figure). Importantly and in contrast, ADAMTS-13 activity, Protein C, and 2-antiplasmin values were within the normal range in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Our data clearly demonstrate the presence of endothelial stress products in the circulating blood of non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. These biomarkers of endothelial injury are suggestive indicators of different aspects of the disease: specifically, release of acute phase reactants, degradation of the endothelial cell glycocalyx, and activation of the complement system. Furthermore, this profile of biomarkers in COVID-19 appears specific, with a differential behavior in comparison with septic shock, in which endothelial damage is also known to be critical. Additional studies are needed to validate these biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools of the endothelial complications in COVID-19 patients, both in early disease and later, as well as supporting specific forms of therapeutic intervention.

Additionally explored was whether these interventions made it more motivating and easier for consumers to select healthier foods and whether potential effects were moderated by consumer health interest. METHODS: Hypotheses were tested with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a simulated online supermarket. Dutch participants (n = 550) chose their preferred product out of six product options for four different categories (breakfast cereals, crackers, pizza, and muesli bars). Participants were randomly allocated to one of eight groups based on the interventions in a 2 (Nutri-Score: present, not present) X 2 (swap offer: present, not present) X 2 (norm message: present, not present) between subject design.

In this cross-sectional study, HCWs from three public and two private hospitals, selected randomly as a pilot, were included. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, hospital role, and usage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Iran FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples. The seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for test performance. Among the 2,065 participants, 1,825 (88.4%) and 240 (11.6%) HCWs were recruited from public and private hospitals, respectively. A total of 340 HCWs were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG or IgM antibodies, and 17.9% of seropositive individuals were asymptomatic. The overall test performance-adjusted seroprevalence estimate among HCWs was 22.6 (95% CI: 20.2C25.1), and PPE usage was significantly higher among HCWs of public vs. private hospitals (66.5 vs. 20.0%). This study found that seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs was higher in private hospitals (37.0%; 95% CI: 28.6C46.2) than public hospitals (20.7%; 95% CI: 18.2C23.3), and also highest among assistant nurses and nurses, and lowest among janitor or superintendent categories. The PPE usage was especially suboptimal among HCWs in private hospitals. Continued effort in access to adequate PPE and regular screening of hospital staff for detecting asymptomatic personnel, especially during the upcoming wave of infection, are warranted.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Among Health Care Workers in Major Private and Public Hospitals With COVID-19 Patient's Referral in Tehran, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has stimulated the interest in the proposal of novel epidemiological models to predict the course of the epidemic so as to help planning effective control strategies. In particular, in order to properly interpret the available data, it has become clear that one must go beyond most classic epidemiological models and consider models that, like the recently proposed SIDARTHE, offer a richer description of the stages of infection. The problem of learning the parameters of these models is of crucial importance especially when assuming that they are time-variant, which further enriches their effectiveness. In this paper we propose a general approach for learning time-variant parameters of dynamic compartmental models from epidemic data. We formulate the problem in terms of a functional risk that depends on the learning variables through the solutions of a dynamic system. The resulting variational problem is then solved by using a gradient flow on a suitable, regularized functional. We forecast the epidemic evolution in Italy and France. Results indicate that the model provides reliable and challenging predictions over all available data as well as the fundamental role of the chosen strategy on the time-variant parameters.","output":"An Optimal Control Approach to Learning in SIDARTHE Epidemic model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the analytical performance of five commercial RT-PCR kits (Genekey, Daan, BioGerm, Liferiver, and Yaneng) commonly used in China, since such comparison data are lacking. METHODS: A total of 20 COVID-19 confirmed patients and 30 negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed by five kits. The detection ability of five RT-PCR kits was evaluated with 5 concentration gradients diluted by a single positive sample. The limit of detection was evaluated by N gene fragment solid standard. Two positive clinical specimens were used to evaluate the repeatability and imprecision. Finally, we used six human coronaviruses plasmid and four respiratory pathogens plasmid to check for cross-reactivity. RESULTS: The positive detection rate was 100% for Genekey, Daan, and BioGerm,and 90% for Liferiver and Yaneng in 20 clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection. The coincidence rate of five kits in 10 negative samples was 100%. The detection rate of target genes for Daan, BioGerm, Liferiver, and Yaneng was 100% from Level 1 to Level 3. In Level 4, only Daan detection rate was 100%. In Level 5, five kits presented poor positive rate. The limit of detection declared by each manufacturer was verified. The repeatability for target genes was less than 5% and so did the total imprecision. There is no cross-reactivity of five kits with six human coronaviruses and four respiratory pathogens for ORF1ab and N gene.

Furthermore, several researchers are working to optimize ecologically friendly procedures for creating metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. The primary goal is to decrease the adverse effects of synthetic processes, their accompanying chemicals, and the resulting complexes. Utilizing various biomaterials for nanoparticle preparation is a beneficial approach in green nanotechnology. Furthermore, using the biological qualities of nature through a variety of activities is an excellent way to achieve this goal. Algae, plants, bacteria, and fungus have been employed to make energy-efficient, low-cost, and nontoxic metallic nanoparticles in the last few decades. Despite the environmental advantages of using green chemistry-based biological synthesis over traditional methods as discussed in this article, there are some unresolved issues such as particle size and shape consistency, reproducibility of the synthesis process, and understanding of the mechanisms involved in producing metallic nanoparticles via biological entities. Consequently, there is a need for further research to analyze and comprehend the real biological synthesis-dependent processes. This is currently an untapped hot research topic that required more investment to properly leverage the green manufacturing of metallic nanoparticles through living entities.

However, most of the available literature describes their antibacterial properties, while knowledge of their antiviral activity is rather scarce. Since the outset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an increasing body of research has suggested their antiviral potential and highlighted the need for further research in this area. In this study, we investigated the virucidal properties of a commercial TiO2-coated photocatalytic glass against a model human coronavirus. Our findings demonstrate that the TiO2-coated glass consistently inactivates coronaviruses upon contact under daylight illumination, in a time-dependent manner. A 99% drop in virus titer was achieved after 3.9 h. The electron micrographs of virus-covered TiO2-glass showed a reduced number of virions compared to control glass. Morphological alterations of TiO2-exposed viruses included deformation, disruption of the viral envelope, and virion ghosts, endorsing the application of this material in the construction of protective elements to mitigate the transmission of viruses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing direct visual evidence of human coronaviruses being damaged and morphologically altered following exposure to this photocatalyst. IMPORTANCE Surface contamination is an important contributor to SARS-CoV-2 spread. The use of personal protective elements and physical barriers (i.e., masks, gloves, and indoor glass separators) increases safety and has proven invaluable in preventing contagion. Redesigning these barriers so that the virus cannot remain infectious on them could make a difference in COVID-19 epidemiology. The introduction of additives with virucidal activity could potentiate the protective effects of these barriers to serve not only as physical containment but also as virus killers, reducing surface contamination after hand touch or aerosol deposition. We performed in-depth analysis of the kinetics of photocatalysis-triggered coronavirus inactivation on building glass coated with TiO2. This is the first report showing direct visual evidence (electron microscopy) of coronaviruses being morphologically damaged following exposure to this photocatalyst, demonstrating the high potential of this material to be incorporated into daily-life high-touch surfaces, giving them an added value in decelerating the virus spread.","output":"Virucidal Properties of Photocatalytic Coating on Glass against a Model Human Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study is to present and discuss how data visualization can be incorporated into teaching approaches by business faculty in introductory business statistics to strengthen business students' practical skills.

Saliva is an attractive option as an alternative for nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), since saliva can be self-collected, is non-invasive, and sample quality is not dependent on the expertise of the collector. OBJECTIVE: To compare SARS CoV-2 positivity on paired NPS and saliva samples. STUDY DESIGN: NPS and paired saliva samples were prospectively collected from symptomatic outpatients suspected of having COVID-19 and were tested by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: In total, 35/124 (26.6 %) samples were RT-PCR positive, with 33/35 positive by NPS (sensitivitya?=a?94.3 % (95 % CI 81.4%-99.0%)) and 30/35 by pure saliva (sensitivitya?=a?85.7 % (95 % CI 70.6%-93.7%)), for an overall agreement of 117/124 (94.4 %). The median cycle threshold value was significantly lower for NPS than for saliva (pa?=a?0.0331). A third or more of pure saliva samples from symptomatic patients were thick, stringy, and difficult to pipet. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time RT-PCR of pure saliva had an overall sensitivity for SARS CoV-2 RNA detection of 85.7 % when compared to simultaneously collected NPS.

The object of this study is to examine the influence of socio-demographic and health-related factors on the avoidance of healthcare utilization during the global outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020. Data were collected through an online survey four weeks after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed the first case in South Korea; 1000 subjects were included in the analysis. The logit model for regression was used to analyze the associations between sociodemographic and health-related factors regarding the avoidance of healthcare utilization. Among the participants, 73.2% avoided healthcare utilization, and there was no significant difference in the prevalence of healthcare avoidance between groups with (72.0%) and without (74.9%) an underlying disease. Sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, income level, and residential area) were related to healthcare avoidance. Among the investigated influencing factors, residential areas highly affected by COVID-19 (i.e., Daegu/Gyeoungbuk region) had the most significant effect on healthcare avoidance. This study found a high prevalence of healthcare avoidance among the general population who under-utilized healthcare resources during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the results reveal that not all societal groups share the burden of healthcare avoidance equally, with it disproportionately affecting those with certain sociodemographic characteristics.

We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making. METHODS and FINDINGS This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included. 47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%). Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%), while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%). In addition, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase was increased significantly in 28 patients (82.35%), as well as -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in 25 patients (73.53%). Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82.36%). The typical feature of ground-glass opacity for adults was rare in paediatric patients (2.94%).

AIMS To evaluate the association between mental disorders and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes following COVID-19. METHOD We performed a cohort study using the Korean COVID-19 patient database based on national health insurance data. Each person with a mental or behavioural disorder (diagnosed during the 6 months prior to their first SARS-CoV-2 test) was matched by age, gender and Charlson Comorbidity Index with up to four people without mental disorders. SARS-CoV-2-positivity risk and the risk of death or severe events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome) post-infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Among 230 565 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, 33 653 (14.6%) had mental disorders; 928/33 653 (2.76%) tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and 56/928 (6.03%) died. In multivariable analysis using the matched cohort, there was no association between mental disorders and SARS-CoV-2-positivity risk (odds ratio OR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.87-1.04); however, a higher risk was associated with schizophrenia-related disorders (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.14-1.99).

SnS2 nanoparticle is encapsulated in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanobox (SnS2 @C). The carbon nanoboxes accommodate the volume change and aggregation of SnS2 during cycling, and form 3D continuous conductive carbon matrix by close contact. The well-designed structure benefits greatly in conductivity and structural stability of the material. As expected, SnS2 @C exhibits considerable capacity, superior cycling stability, and excellent rate capability in both SIBs and PIBs. Additionally, in situ Raman technology is unprecedentedly conducted to investigate the phase evolution of polysulfides. This work provides an avenue for facilely constructing stable and high-capacity metal dichalcogenide based anodes materials with optimized structure engineering. The proposed in-depth electrochemical measurements coupled with in situ and ex situ characterizations will provide fundamental understandings for the storage mechanism of metal dichalcogenides.","output":"Structural Engineering of SnS2 Encapsulated in Carbon Nanoboxes for High-Performance Sodium/Potassium-Ion Batteries Anodes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School closure was the only main control measure that Japan took into action from late February to late March in 2020.

Unfortunately, no treatment or vaccine currently exists for COVID-19, although several clinical trials are on-going to find a definite solution to this pandemic. Prevention through public health measures remain the best strategy recommended till date. This prevention involves physical distancing and compulsory confinement at home in several European countries, in the UK and USA. Unfortunately, home confinement decreed in most high-income countries like France has been dangerous for women, victims of psychological, physical and sexual violence from their intimate partner. Violence between intimate partners has become an unintended consequence of the stay-at-home policy against COVID-19. Since the promulgation of a home confinement decreed in many high resource settings (USA, UK, Europe, Canada, Australia, etc), the rate of violence between intimate partners has increased tremendously resulting to the worst scenario, womens death in some of these countries.

To further characterize the CEA gene family, we have determined the genomic structures of CGM9 and CGM11, analyzed the promoter regions of all eleven PSGs, studied the CGM15-PSG13 intergenic region and the evolutionary relationships beween the CEA family genes. CGM9, a typical CEA subgroup member, was a pseudogene with the exon structure [5'UTR-L-L/N-TM-Cyt-3'UTR]. CGM11 contained a mixture of exons derived from CEA and PSG subgroup genes. The formula of the CGM11 pseudogene was [5'UTR-L-L/N-C-3'UTR]. Thus both genes lacked the IgC2-like domains typically found in CEA subfamily members. The upstream promoter regions of all eleven PSGs were characterized. All PSG promoters lacked the classical TATA and CCAAT elements, but had putative PEA3 box(es), CACCC box(es), a RARE box, and poly (dG-dT) repeats of different lengths. Five PSGs also had an SP1 site. The complete 10-kb intergenic region between CGM15 and PSG13 was sequenced. Clusters of different types of repetitive sequences were seen. The time of divergence of the CEA and PSG subfamilies was estimated to be 107.7 +/- 17.1 million years, or at about the time of human-rodent divergence.

To facilitate planning of mental health services, empirical data on mental health problems and service utilization of populations affected by the epidemic are urgently needed. This study investigated the prevalence of mental health problems of residents within and outside Wuhan, China, as well as their patterns of mental health service utilization. Methods From January 27 to February 2, 2020, an online cross-sectional survey recruited residents from 4 subpopulations: Wuhan residents (n=2,617), migrants from Wuhan (those who left Wuhan before lockdown, n=930), other Hubei residents (n=633), and residents of other provinces of China (\\"other residents\\", n=3,561). Participants' mental health problems and patterns of utilization of mental health services in recent days were assessed with standardized assessments. Results Among the 4 groups, Wuhan residents had the highest rate of any type of mental health problem (i.e., psychological distress: 41.9%), followed by migrants from Wuhan (34.2%), other Hubei residents (24.8%), and other residents (21.1%). Rates of perceived mental health needs and utilization of mental health services during recent days were 10.2% and 1.9% for Wuhan residents, 8.4% and 1.8% for migrants from Wuhan, 6.2% and 1.1% for other Hubei residents, and 6.4% and 1.0% for other residents, respectively. Overall, 63.0% mental health service users received services via internet and telephone, and 83.1% participants with perceived mental health needs ascribed their lack of help-seeking to barriers to accessibility and availability.

Immune and non-immune cells produce the IL-37 precursor upon pro-inflammatory stimuli. Intracellularly, caspase-1 cleaves and activates IL-37, and its mature form binds to Smad3; this complex translocates into the nucleus where it suppresses cytokine production, consequently reducing inflammation. Extracellularly, IL-37 forms a complex with IL-18R and IL-1R8 (formerly TIR8 or SIGIRR) that transduces anti-inflammatory signals by the suppression of NF-B and MAPK and the activation of Mer-PTEN-DOK pathways. During inflammation, IL-37 suppresses the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokine in favor to the expression of the anti-inflammatory ones by the regulation of macrophage polarization, lipid metabolism, inflammasome function, TSLP synthesis and miRNAs function. Moreover, IL-37 not only regulates the innate and acquired immunity, but also improves aging-associated immunosenescence. Furthermore, IL-37 exerts an inhibitory effect on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, and progression. Finally, IL-37 may have a potential ability to reduce excessive inflammation since it is aberrantly expressed in patients with inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer, thus, it may be used as a marker for different types of diseases. Therefore, this review provides an updated view of the role of IL-37 in human health and disease, and discusses the potential of IL-37 as a therapeutic target and biomarker in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.","output":"Current Understanding of IL-37 in Human Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the challenges of meaningful health care digitization. The need for rapid yet validated decision-making requires robust data infrastructure. Organizations with a focus on learning health care (LHC) systems tend to adapt better to rapidly evolving data needs. Few studies have demonstrated a successful implementation of data digitization principles in an LHC context across health care systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We share our experience and provide a framework for assembling and organizing multidisciplinary resources, structuring and regulating research needs, and developing a single source of truth (SSoT) for COVID-19 research by applying fundamental principles of health care digitization, in the context of LHC systems across a complex health care organization. METHODS: Houston Methodist (HM) comprises eight tertiary care hospitals and an expansive primary care network across Greater Houston, Texas. During the early phase of the pandemic, institutional leadership envisioned the need to streamline COVID-19 research and established the retrospective research task force (RRTF). We describe an account of the structure, functioning, and productivity of the RRTF. We further elucidate the technical and structural details of a comprehensive data repositorythe HM COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). We particularly highlight how CURATOR conforms to standard health care digitization principles in the LHC context. RESULTS: The HM COVID-19 RRTF comprises expertise in epidemiology, health systems, clinical domains, data sciences, information technology, and research regulation. The RRTF initially convened in March 2020 to prioritize and streamline COVID-19 observational research; to date, it has reviewed over 60 protocols and made recommendations to the institutional review board (IRB). The RRTF also established the charter for CURATOR, which in itself was IRB-approved in April 2020. CURATOR is a relational structured query language database that is directly populated with data from electronic health records, via largely automated extract, transform, and load procedures. The CURATOR design enables longitudinal tracking of COVID-19 cases and controls before and after COVID-19 testing. CURATOR has been set up following the SSoT principle and is harmonized across other COVID-19 data sources. CURATOR eliminates data silos by leveraging unique and disparate big data sources for COVID-19 research and provides a platform to capitalize on institutional investment in cloud computing. It currently hosts deeply phenotyped sociodemographic, clinical, and outcomes data of approximately 200,000 individuals tested for COVID-19. It supports more than 30 IRB-approved protocols across several clinical domains and has generated numerous publications from its core and associated data sources. CONCLUSIONS: A data-driven decision-making strategy is paramount to the success of health care organizations. Investment in cross-disciplinary expertise, health care technology, and leadership commitment are key ingredients to foster an LHC system. Such systems can mitigate the effects of ongoing and future health care catastrophes by providing timely and validated decision support.","output":"Rapid Response to Drive COVID-19 Research in a Learning Health Care System: Rationale and Design of the Houston Methodist COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought immense challenges on the health system including HIV care service.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Traumatic injury can be a source of unexpected financial burden for households. However, the effect of increasing participation in higher cost-sharing private health insurance plans remains unknown. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort observational study, using the Clinformatics Data Mart Database, a nationwide single-payer administrative claims database to identify US adults who required emergency department services or hospital admission for single traumatic injury from 2008 to 2018. A two-part model using a logistic regression and a generalized linear model with gamma distribution and log link was used to evaluate 12-month out-of-pocket costs after traumatic injury. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure after injury. RESULTS Of 426,945 included patients, 53% were male, 71% were white, and median age was 42 years. Patients faced monthly OOPC of $660 at the time of their injury. High deductible plan enrollment was associated with an increase of $1,703 in 12-month OOPC after trauma, compared to those covered by traditional health plans. In addition to HDHP enrollment, worsening injury severity and longer hospital stays were also associated with increased 12-month OOPC after trauma. Non-white minorities paid less 12-month OOPC after trauma compared to non-Hispanic white patients, but also used fewer services. Overall, the incidence of CHE was 5%; however high-deductible health plan enrollees faced a 13% chance of CHE.

Methods: We identified hypertensive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service from inception to May 15, 2020. The primary outcome was the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and death from COVID-19. The individual components were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Results: Of 1,374 hypertensive patients with COVID-19, 1,076 (78.3%) and 298 (21.7%) were users and never-users of RAAS inhibitors, respectively. The RAAS inhibitor users were not associated with the risk of the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 1.10). The risk of ICU admission was significantly lower in the users than the never-users (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.84). The RAAS inhibitors were beneficial only in ICU admissions that did not require IMV (aOR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.58). The risk of death from COVID-19 was comparable between the groups (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.85). We could not evaluate the risks of CRRT and ECMO owing to the small number of events. Conclusion: RAAS inhibitor use was not associated with the composite of severe outcomes in the hypertensive patients with COVID-19 but significantly lowered the risk of ICU admission, particularly in patients who did not require IMV.","output":"Use of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors and Severe COVID-19 Outcomes in Patients with Hypertension: A Nationwide Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The \\"coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\\" outbreak was first reported in December 2019 (China).

Moreover, the differences in experience between the nurse group and the inexperienced group do not affect the sensitivity, specificity, or classification times. The pressure-flow diagram significantly increases sensitivity and decreases the response time of early asynchrony detection performed by nurses. Moreover, the data suggest that operator experience does not affect the identification results.

The COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) Study aimed to contemporaneously report outcomes for patients undergoing vascular interventions worldwide during the pandemic. METHODS: COVER is an international multi-centre observational cohort study of outcomes following vascular interventions during the pandemic. The primary outcome was to capture procedural information on all open and endovascular interventions undertaken. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and changes in management resulting from the pandemic. RESULTS: 1103 patients from 57 institutions in 19 countries were enrolled. Mean age was 66.913.9 (756% male). The rate of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection was 40%. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 11.0%. Aortic interventions had a mortality of 152% (23/151), amputations 121% (28/232), carotid interventions 107% (11/103) and lower limb revascularisation 98% (51/521). Increased risk of in-hospital mortality was noted for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory tract infection, Caucasian ethnicity and those undergoing urgent/immediate surgery.

Lianhua Qingwen is believed to possess the ability to treat or significantly improve the symptoms of COVID-19. These claims make it important to systematically evaluate the effects of using Lianhua Qingwen with Western medicine to treat COVID-19. Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy, employing Lianhua Qingwen with Western medicine, to treat COVID-19, using a meta-analysis approach. Search strategy China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, VIP Database, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies evaluating the effect of Lianhua Qingwen-Western medicine combination therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. Inclusion criteria (1) Research object: hospitalized patients meeting the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 were included. (2) Intervention measures: patients in the treatment group received Lianhua Qingwen treatment combined with Western medicine, while the control group received either Western medicine or Chinese medicine treatment. (3) Research type: randomized controlled trials and retrospective study were included. Data extraction and analysis Two researchers extracted the first author, the proportion of males and females, age, body temperature, course of treatment, rate of disappearance of main symptoms, duration of fever, adverse reactions, and total effectiveness from the literature. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as the effect value for count data, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI were used as the effect value for measurement data. Results Six articles met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 856 COVID-19 patients. The meta-analysis showed that Lianhua Qingwen combination therapy achieved higher rates of fever reduction (OR = 3.43, 95% CI [1.78, 6.59], P = 0.0002), cough reduction (OR = 3.39, 95% CI [1.85, 6.23], P < 0.0001), recovery from shortness of breath (OR = 10.62, 95% CI [3.71, 30.40], P < 0.0001) and recovery from fatigue (OR = 2.82, 95% CI [1.44, 5.53], P = 0.003), higher total effectiveness rate (OR = 2.51, 95% CI [1.73, 3.64], P < 0.00001), and shorter time to recovery from fever (MD = C1.00, 95% CI [C1.04, 0.96], P < 0.00001), and did not increase the adverse reaction rate (OR = 0.65, 95% CI [0.42, 1.01], P = 0.06), compared to the single medication control. Conclusion The Lianhua Qingwen and Western medicine combination therapy is highly effective for COVID-19 patients and has good clinical safety. As only a small number of studies and patients were included in this review, more high-quality, multicenter, large-sample-size, randomized, double-blind, controlled trials are still needed for verification.","output":"Meta-analysis on the effect of combining lianhua qingwen with western medicine to treat coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a grave threat to public health and the global economy.

A nanotubular morphology was observed for the ST, as proved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM); a subsequent heat-treatment at 400 C allowed a complete transformation of sodium tri- to hexa-titanates and an increase in bandgap. The obtained ST were impregnated with Ag+ and Zn+ cations, ST-Ag and ST-Zn, respectively, to tune the materials' bandgap. XPS analysis of the ST-Ag materials showed evidence of metallic Ag, pointing to the formation of silver nanoparticles, whereas for ST-Zn oxide phases were mainly spotted.

As SARS-CoV is thought to infect the alveolar epithelial cell of the lung,in the present study, a type II alveolar epithelial cell clone, T7, was used to analyze the mechanism of CTL against SARS CoV membrane antigens. Mice vaccinated with SARS CoV (N) DNA or (M) DNA using pcDNA 3.1 (+) plasmid vector showed T-cell immune responses (CTL induction and proliferation) against type II alveolar epithelial cells (T7) transfected with SARS (N) or (M) DNA, respectively. To determine whether these DNA vaccines could induce T-cell immune responses in humans as well as in mice, SCID-PBL/hu mice were immunized with these DNA vaccines. PBL from healthy human volunteers were administered i.p. into IL-2 receptor gamma-chain-disrupted NOD-SCID mice [IL-2R(-/-) NOD-SCID]. SCID-PBL/hu mice thus constructed can be used to analyze the human immune response in vivo. The SCID-PBL/hu mice were immunized with SARS (N) DNA or (M) DNA and analyzed for a human T-cell immune response.

While it is established that patients with COVID-19 who are undergoing surgery have a significantly higher risk of experiencing postoperative complications and mortality, it is not well-known at what time after testing positive the risk of postoperative complications or mortality returns to normal. METHODS: PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and professional society websites were systematically reviewed on March 7(th), 2022 to identify studies and guidelines on the optimal timeframe to reschedule patients for elective surgery after preoperatively testing positive for COVID-19. Outcomes included postoperative complications such as mortality, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies and professional society guidelines met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 should be rescheduled 4-8 weeks after testing positive (as long as they do not develop symptoms in the interim), patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 should be rescheduled 6-8 weeks after testing positive (with complete resolution of symptoms), and patients with severe/critical COVID-19 should be rescheduled at a minimum of 12 weeks after hospital discharge (with complete resolution of symptoms). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Given the negative association between preoperative COVID-19 and postoperative complications, patients should have elective arthroplasty surgery rescheduled at differing timeframes based on their symptoms.

The doseCresponse model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen\\\\binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to the development of mechanistic doseCresponse models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.","output":"Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus doseCresponse models as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution is a serious threat to our health and has become one of the major causes of many diseases including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer.

The aim of this study was to describe the role of gender on clinical features and 28-day mortality in Covid-19 patients. METHODS: Observational study of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Bergamo, Italy, during the first three weeks of the outbreak. Medical records, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings upon admission and treatment have been collected. Primary outcome was 28-day mortality since hospitalization. RESULTS: 431 consecutive adult patients were admitted. Female patients were 119 (27.6%) with a mean age of 67.0  14.5 years (vs 67.8  12.5 for males, p = 0.54). Previous history of myocardial infarction, vasculopathy and former smoking habits were more common for males. At the time of admission PaO2/FiO2 was similar between men and women (228 [IQR, 134-273] vs 238 mmHg [150-281], p = 0.28). Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) assistance was needed in the first 24 h more frequently in male patients (25.7% vs 13.0%; p = 0.006). Overall 28-day mortality was 26.1% in women and 38.1% in men (p = 0.018). Gender did not result an independent predictor of death once the parameters related to disease severity at presentation were included in the multivariable analysis (p = 0.898). Accordingly, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in female and male patients requiring CPAP or non-invasive ventilation in the first 24 h did not find a significant difference (p = 0.687). CONCLUSION: Hospitalized women are less likely to die from Covid-19; however, once severe disease occurs, the risk of dying is similar to men.

Here, we establish a clinically applicable strategy for early identification of IFN-AAB-positive patients for potential subsequent clinical interventions. MethodsWe analysed sera of 430 COVID-19 patients with severe and critical disease from four hospitals for presence of IFN-AABs by ELISA. Binding specificity and neutralizing activity were evaluated via competition assay and virus-infection-based neutralization assay. We defined clinical parameters associated with IFN-AAB positivity. In a subgroup of critically ill patients, we analyzed effects of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) on the levels of IFN-AABs, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clinical outcome. ResultsThe prevalence of neutralizing AABs to IFN- and IFN-{omega} in COVID-19 patients was 4.2% (18/430), while being undetectable in an uninfected control cohort. Neutralizing IFN-AABs were detectable exclusively in critically affected, predominantly male (83%) patients (7.6% IFN- and 4.6% IFN-{omega} in 207 patients with critical COVID-19). IFN-AABs were present early post-symptom onset and at the peak of disease. Fever and oxygen requirement at hospital admission co-presented with neutralizing IFN-AAB positivity. IFN-AABs were associated with higher mortality (92.3% versus 19.1 % in patients without IFN-AABs). TPE reduced levels of IFN-AABs in three of five patients and may increase survival of IFN-AAB-positive patients compared to those not undergoing TPE. ConclusionIFN-AABs may serve as early biomarker for development of severe COVID-19. We propose to implement routine screening of hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to our algorithm for rapid identification of patients with IFN-AABs who most likely benefit from specific therapies.","output":"Early and rapid identification of COVID-19 patients with neutralizing type I-interferon auto-antibodies by an easily implementable algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical decision-making has, across the history of the NHS, made a transitional journey from a model characterised by paternalism to one which places emphasis on partnership and patient autonomy.

Admission Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) and Lung Ultrasound (LUS) can be of great help in clinical decision making, especially during the current pandemic and the consequent overcrowding of the Emergency Department (ED). The aim of the study was to demonstrate the capability of alveolar-to-arterial oxygen difference (AaDO(2)) in predicting the need for subsequent oxygen support and survival in patients with COVID-19 infection, especially in the presence of baseline normal PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (P/F) values. Methods: A cohort of 223 swab-confirmed COVID-19 patients underwent clinical evaluation, blood tests, ABG and LUS in the ED. LUS score was derived from 12 ultrasound lung windows. AaDO(2) was derived as AaDO(2) = ((FiO(2)) (Atmospheric pressure ? H(2)O pressure) ? (PaCO(2)/R)) ? PaO(2). Endpoints were subsequent oxygen support need and survival. Results: A close relationship between AaDO(2) and P/F and between AaDO(2) and LUS score was observed (R(2) = 0.88 and R(2) = 0.67, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). In the subgroup of patients with P/F between 300 and 400, 94.7% (n = 107) had high AaDO(2) values, and 51.4% (n = 55) received oxygen support, with 2 ICU admissions and 10 deaths. According to ROC analysis, AaDO(2) > 39.4 had 83.6% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity (AUC 0.936; p < 0.001) in predicting subsequent oxygen support, whereas a LUS score > 6 showed 89.7% sensitivity and 75.0% specificity (AUC 0.896; p < 0.001). KaplanCMeier curves showed different mortality in the AaDO(2) subgroups (p = 0.0025).

Different geographical areas of the Northern Hemisphere in the United States and in Europe were selected in order to provide a wide range among the different parameters. The death rates were gathered from an available dataset. As a further control, we also included latitude, as a proxy for temperature. Methods: Utilizing a publicly available dataset, we retrieved data for the months of March and April 2020 for 25 areas in Europe and in the US. We computed the monthly number of deaths/1M people of confirmed COVID-19 cases and calculated the average monthly high temperatures and population density for all these areas. We determined the correlation between number of deaths/1M people and the average monthly high temperatures, the latitude and the population density. Results: We divided our analysis in two parts: analysis of the correlation among the different variables in the month of March and subsequent analysis in the month of April. The differences were then evaluated. In the month of March there was no statistical correlation between average monthly high temperatures of the considered geographical areas and number of deaths/1M people. However, a statistically significant inverse correlation became significant in the month of April between average monthly high temperatures (p=0.0043) and latitude (p=0.0253) with number of deaths/1M people. We also observed a statistically significant correlation between population density and number of deaths/1M people both in the month of March (p=0.0297) and in the month of April (p=0.0116), when three areas extremely populated (NYC, Los Angeles and Washington DC) were included in the calculation. Once these three areas were removed, the correlation was not statistically significant (p=0.1695 in the month of March, and p=0.7076 in the month of April). Conclusions: The number of COVID-19-related deaths/1M people was essentially the same during the month of March for all the geographical areas considered, indicating essentially that the infection was circulating quite uniformly except for Lombardy, Italy, where it started earlier. Lockdown measures were implemented between the end of March and beginning of April, except for Italy which started March 9 th . We observed a strong, statistically significant inverse correlation between average monthly high temperatures with the number of deaths/1M people. We confirmed the data by analyzing the correlation with the latitude, which can be considered a proxy for high temperature.

This has proved disruptive to global socio-economic activities. One of the challenges that has been faced in this regard is the increased coastal flooding of cities. This study examined the trends and impacts of coastal flooding in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Making use of archival climate data and primary data from key informants and field observations, it emerged that there is a statistically significant increase in the frequency of flooding and consequent human and economic losses from such in the coastal cities of the province. Flooding in urban areas of the Western Cape is a factor of human and natural factors ranging from extreme rainfall, usually caused by persistent cut off-lows, midlatitude cyclones, cold fronts and intense storms. Such floods become compounded by poor drainage caused by vegetative overgrowth on waterways and land pollution that can be traced to poor drainage maintenance. Clogging of waterways and drainage systems enhances the risk of flooding. Increased urbanisation, overpopulation in some areas and non-adherence to environmental laws results in both the affluent and poor settling on vulnerable ecosystems. These include coastal areas, estuaries, and waterways, and this worsens the risk of flooding.

Sophisticated, remote monitoring technologies now exist that support at-home care. Advances in the research of smart homes for health monitoring have shown these technologies are capable of recognizing and predicting health changes in near-real time. However, few nurses are familiar enough with this technology to use smart homes for optimizing patient care or expanding their reach into the home between healthcare touch points. Objective : The objective of this work is to explore a partnership between nurses and smart homes for automated remote monitoring and assessing of patient health. A series of health event cases is presented to demonstrate how this partnership may be harnessed to effectively detect and report on clinically relevant health events that can be automatically detected by smart homes. Participants : 25 participants with multiple chronic health conditions Methods : Ambient sensors were installed in the homes of 25 participants with multiple chronic health conditions. Motion, light, temperature, and door usage data were continuously collected from participants homes. Descriptions of health events and participants associated behaviors were captured via weekly nursing telehealth visits with study participants and used to analyze sensor data representing health events. Two cases of participants with congestive heart failure exacerbations, one case of urinary tract infection, two cases of bowel inflammation flares, and four cases of participants with sleep interruption were explored. Results : For each case, clinically relevant health events aligned with changes from baseline in behavior data patterns derived from sensors installed in the participant's home.

Methods: A multicenter cohort study was conducted of 3,473 adult hospitalized patients with reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) positive SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to four New York City hospitals between March 10 through May 20, 2020. Exclusion criteria were: death or discharge within 24h, comfort-care status, clinical trial enrollment, treatment with an IL-6 inhibitor or remdesivir. Patients who received Zn+ionophore were compared to patients who did not using multivariable time-dependent cox proportional hazards models for time to in-hospital death adjusting for confounders including age, sex, race, BMI, diabetes, week of admission, hospital location, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, intubation, acute renal failure, neurological events, treatment with corticosteroids, azithromycin or lopinavir/ritonavir and the propensity score of receiving Zn+ionophore. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a propensity score-matched cohort of patients who did or did not receive Zn+ionophore matched by age, sex and ventilator status. Results: Among 3,473 patients (median age 64, 1947 [56%] male, 522 [15%] ventilated, 545[16%] died), 1,006 (29%) received Zn+ionophore. Zn+ionophore was associated with a 24% reduced risk of in-hospital mortality (12% of those who received Zn+ionophore died versus 17% who did not; adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.96, P=0.023). More patients who received Zn+ionophore were discharged home (72% Zn+ionophore vs 67% no Zn+ionophore, P=0.003) Neither Zn nor the ionophore alone were associated with decreased mortality rates.

Complete understanding of COVID-19, the multi-faceted disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, requires suitable small animal models, as does the development and evaluation of vaccines and antivirals2. Because age-dependent differences of COVID-19 were identified in humans3, we compared the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and aged Syrian hamsters. We show that virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract was independent of the age of the animals. However, older hamsters exhibited more pronounced and consistent weight loss. In situ hybridization in the lungs identified viral RNA in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, and macrophages. Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, with young hamsters launching earlier and stronger immune cell influx than aged hamsters. The latter developed conspicuous alveolar and perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. In contrast, we observed rapid lung recovery at day 14 after infection only in young hamsters.

Patients continued to exhibit cardiac arrhythmias after hospital discharge of a type and frequency similar to that seen during hospitalization. These findings suggest that the risk of arrhythmia associated with COVID infection remains elevated throughout the hospital course as well as following hospital discharge.","output":"Arrhythmia patterns during and after hospitalization for COVID-19 infection detected via patch-based mobile cardiac telemetry()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To report long-term outcomes of patients treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for early stage, peripherally located non-small cell lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively between September 2009 and May 2019. Electronic medical records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, treatment details and outcomes. All patients were treated according to local protocol based on the national UK SABR Consortium guidelines. Risk-adapted treatment schedules were used depending on the size and the location of the tumour (54 Gy in three fractions, 55 Gy in five fractions, 60 Gy in eight fractions or 50 Gy in 10 fractions). Overall survival outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In total, 412 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 76 years (range 48-93 years). Histological confirmation was obtained in 233 cases (56.6%). The median overall survival for all patients was 42.3 months (95% confidence interval 37.3-47.3 months), with 3- and 5-year overall survival of 52.8% and 37.3%, respectively. For biopsy-proven patients (56.6%), 3- and 5-year overall survival was 57.3% and 40.1%, respectively. With respect to overall survival, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed no significant difference in survival by technique (volume-modulated arc therapy versus conformal; three-dimensional computed tomography versus four-dimensional computed tomography), tumour location, smoking status at first contact, pre-treatment tumour stage or pre-treatment standardised uptake value. Survival was poorer for patients who received the 50 Gy in 10 fractions schedule. Treatment was very well tolerated with very low rates of grade 3-4 toxicity (1%). CONCLUSIONS: SABR for peripherally located, medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer can be safely and effectively implemented in a non-academic institution with appropriate equipment and training. Overall survival outcomes and toxicity rates are comparable with internationally published studies. Patients treated with 50 Gy in 10 fractions had a poorer survival outcome.","output":"Long-term Overall Survival Outcomes in Patients with Early Stage, Peripherally Located, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in a Non-academic Cancer Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Mouse models provide powerful tools to investigate disease mechanisms and are widely used in inflammatory bowel disease research. However, it is common for reports of mouse model studies to lack potentially important information about the microbial status of the mice and the method used to evaluate disease expression for statistical analysis. For example, it is common practice to state that the mice were housed under specific pathogen\\\\free conditions but provide no further information regarding the presence or absence of organisms such as Helicobacter spp. that are known or likely to affect disease expression, thus omitting information potentially important to the expected phenotype of the mice and their responses to experimental manipulation. We therefore encourage authors to use such terms as conventional and specific pathogen\\\\free precisely, to state the agents from which the mice are represented to be free, and to provide a brief description of the health monitoring protocol. Descriptions of histopathologic methods used to evaluate colitis in mouse models also often do not include sufficient detail to allow readers to understand and evaluate the methods; in addition, the lesions commonly are shown in photomicrographs that are too small and of too low resolution to be interpreted. Inasmuch as such methods are often the major or only source of data upon which conclusions regarding genotype or experimental treatment effects are based, the method employed should be fully described, and photomicrographs should be of adequate size and resolution to allow independent assessment.

Measurement . The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) developed an expedited amendment process for research shifting to remote data collection. For the Cohort 3, 14-month data collection period, we adapted our protocol to allow data collection via telephone and e-mail. We were unable to collect certain measures that required face-to face contact. Results . For measures that could be collected remotely, 14-month retention was similar for Cohort 3 and earlier cohorts: data were collected for 86.9% of cohort 3 (remote) and 87.9% of cohorts 1 and2 (face to face), p = .84. Conclusions . In order to preserve the integrity of our clinical trial and ensure the safety of our participants and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to carefully and efficiently adapt our data collection procedures.

We review the literature on several areas that have been affected including surgical selection, inpatient care, and physician well-being. These areas affecting inpatient paradigms include surgical priority, physical or social distancing, file sharing for online clinical communications, and physician wellness. During this crisis, it is important that orthopaedic departments place an emphasis on personnel safety and slowing the spread of the virus so that the department can still maintain vital functions. Physical distancing and emerging technologies such as inpatient telemedicine and online file sharing applications can enable orthopaedic programs to still function while attempting to protect medical staff and patients from the novel coronavirus spread. This literature review sought to provide evidence-based guidance to orthopaedic departments during an unprecedented time.

The Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) Organ Center is tasked with allocating arguably the most difficult-to-place kidneys, and we hypothesized an accelerated placement pathway would increase utilization of kidneys placed by the Organ Center. The Kidney Accelerated Placement (KAP) project, implemented by the Organ Center from 7/18/2019 - 7/15/2020, aimed to offer kidneys with a high kidney donor profile index to programs that had a history of accepting such organs. We compared OPTN kidney match run, donor, and transplant recipient data during the project period and one year prior. There was no statistically significant change in the percentage of KAP-eligible donors accepted during the project period (16.4%) compared to the prior year (17.5%). Conversion from acceptance to transplant was higher under KAP (72.7% vs. 71.2%), though not significant.

Based on updated field investigation and in-depth interviews between 2008 and 2012, the study argues that the Greater PRD has undergone dramatic restructuring of regional governance since mid 2000s, reflected by rescaling attempts initiated by Guangdong provincial government and bottom-up resistance from local residents in Hong Kong. The interaction of the rescaling dynamics has engendered the contested geopolitics of the cross-boundary governance as the regional integration intensified. Notably, the complexity of cross-boundary governance has been heightened by emerging conflicts, resulted from the increasing number of mainlanders as individual visitors to Hong Kong since the implementation of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), the first bilateral free trade agreement between Hong Kong and China effective from 2004.

Dietary intake must be sufficient to meet these micronutrient requirements. Mineral deficiency does not seem to be the result of a physically active life or of athletic training but is more likely to arise from disturbances in the quality and quantity of ingested food. The lack of some minerals in the body appears to be symbolic of the modern era reflecting either the excessive intake of empty calories or a negative energy balance from drastic weight-loss diets. Several animal studies provide convincing evidence for an association between dietary micronutrient availability and microbial composition in the gut. However, the influence of human gut microbiota on the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of trace elements in human food has rarely been studied. Bacteria play a role by effecting mineral bioavailability and bioaccessibility, which are further increased through the fermentation of cereals and the soaking and germination of crops. Moreover, probiotics have a positive effect on iron, calcium, selenium, and zinc in relation to gut microbiome composition and metabolism. The current literature reveals the beneficial effects of bacteria on mineral bioaccessibility and bioavailability in supporting both the human gut microbiome and overall health.

DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, Cochrane, PsycINFO, PsychExtra, Web of Science and Scopus were searched for any paper from 2019 onwards that focused on the mental health impact of COVID-19 on imprisoned people and prison staff. A grey literature search focused on international and government sources and professional bodies representing healthcare, public health and prison staff was also performed. We also performed hand searching of the reference lists of included studies. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF STUDIES: All papers, regardless of study design, were included if they examined the mental health of imprisoned people or prison staff specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Imprisoned people could be of any age and from any countries. All languages were included. Two independent reviewers quality assessed appropriate papers. RESULTS: Of 647 articles found, 83 were eligible for inclusion, the majority (58%) of which were opinion pieces. The articles focused on the challenges to prisoner mental health. Fear of COVID-19, the impact of isolation, discontinuation of prison visits and reduced mental health services were all likely to have an adverse effect on the mental well-being of imprisoned people. The limited research and poor quality of articles included mean that the findings are not conclusive. However, they suggest a significant adverse impact on the mental health and well-being of those who live and work in prisons.

TAD is a promising concept for axillary restaging in node-positive breast cancer patients with pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). We aimed to evaluate TAD feasibility in this context. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in biopsy-confirmed cN1 patients. The removal of the clipped node (CN) was guided by intraoperative ultrasound. SNB used indocyanine green and patent blue V dye. If the CN or sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) had any metastatic foci, or the TAD procedure was unsuccessful, the patient underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included. TAD and SNB identification rates were 97.3%. Every retrieved CN was also a SLN. At the individual level, SNB identification rate was 89.2% with indocyanine green and 85.5% with patent blue V dye. The CN identification rate was 81.1%, being higher when the CN was localized on the intraoperative ultrasound (84.4% vs 60.0%). Nodal pCR was achieved by 54.1% of our patients and was more frequent in HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors (p = 0.039). Nineteen patients were spared from ALND. CONCLUSION: TAD with intraoperative ultrasound-guided excision of the CN and SNB with indocyanine green and patent blue V dye is a feasible concept to identify patients without axillary residual disease after NAT, that can be spared from ALND, although the need for marking the biopsied node should be further investigated.","output":"Initial experience with targeted axillary dissection after neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] In this study, we report the fabrication of aluminum oxide-coated glass (ACG) slides for the preparation of glycan microarrays.

Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Womens Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (>14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those 80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW >14.5% vs 14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.","output":"Association of Red Blood Cell Distribution Width With Mortality Risk in Hospitalized Adults With SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early 2020, the world has faced an unprecedented pandemic caused by the novel COVID-19 virus. In this study, we characterize the impact of the lockdown associated with the pandemic on air quality in six major cities across the state of Florida, namely: Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Gainesville, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami. Hourly measurements of PM2.5, ozone, NO2, SO2, and CO were provided by the US EPA at thirty sites operated by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection during mid-February to mid-April from 2015 through 2020. To analyze the effect of the pandemic, atmospheric pollutant concentrations in 2020 were compared to historic data at these cities during the same period from 2015 to 2019. Reductions in NO2 and CO levels were observed across the state in most cities and were attributed to restrictions in mobility and the decrease in vehicle usage amid the lockdown. Likewise, decreases in O3 concentrations were observed and were related to the prevailing NOx-limited regime during this time period. Changes in concentrations of SO2 exhibited spatial variations, concentrations decreased in northern cities, however an increase was observed in central and southern cities, likely due to increased power generation at facilities primarily in the central and southern regions of the state. PM2.5 levels varied temporally during the study and were positively correlated with SO2 concentrations during the lockdown. In March, reductions in PM2.5 levels were observed, however elevations in PM2.5 concentrations in April were attributed to long-range transport of pollutants rather than local emissions. This study provides further insight into the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on anthropogenic sources from vehicular emissions and power generation in Florida.

The aim of this study is to assess the effect of concomitant HHR on postoperative GERD symptoms in our patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of patients who underwent LSG with or without HHR between 2011and 2014 was performed. Pre- and postoperative GERD symptoms were assessed at different time intervals until a maximum of 2 years after the surgery. RESULTS The study included 165 patients; 76 (46%) underwent LSG with concomitant HHR (group A) while the rest underwent only LSG (group B). Baseline GERD complaints were more prevalent in group A (61.8 vs 41.6%, p = 0.04), in which 44 patients (57.9%) had evidence of hiatal hernia on preoperative EGD. In the remaining 32 patients, it was diagnosed intraoperatively. GERD symptoms did not significantly differ between the two groups after years 1 and 2. GERD remission was observed in 21.3% of the 76 patients who underwent concomitant HHR (group A) and in 29.7% of those who did not (group B) while new-onset GERD symptoms were reported in 12 patients (41.4%) in group A and in 24 patients (46.2%) in group B.

Abnormal coagulation profiles were reported to be associated with poor outcomes. In this study, we assessed the prognostic values of antithrombin (AT) activity levels and the impact of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) treatment on outcome. Materials and Methods: Conventional coagulation parameters as well as AT activity levels and outcomes of 104 consecutive critically ill acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with AT activity below 75% were treated with FFP. Maximum AT activity levels achieved in those patients were recorded. Results: AT activity levels at admission were significantly lower in nonsurvivors than survivors (73% vs. 81%). The cutoff level for admission AT activity was 79% and 58% was the lowest AT for survival. The outcome in those patients who had AT activity levels above 75% after FFP treatment was better than that of the nonresponding group. As well as AT, admission values of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were coagulation and inflammatory parameters among the mortality risk factors. Conclusion: AT activity could be used as a prognostic marker for survival and organ failure in COVID-19-associated ARDS patients.

However, drugs used for single dose treatments must possess important characteristics, namely, long half-life, effective concentration in tissues over a long period, and low toxicity. In tropical medicine, such drugs are an important advance in the treatment of malaria (mefloquine and halofantrine), schistosomiasis (praziquantel and metrifonate), filariasis (ivermectin), and genitourinary tract and intestinal infections. Intestinal infections are one of the most frequent problems in tropical medicine. While a large number of cases of diarrhoea are of viral (rotavirus) or bacterial (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) origin, necessitating only oral rehydration, some are of parasitological origin (Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, Strongyloides, Trichuris, Schistosoma) and can be cured by a single dose treatment (tinidazole, secnidazole, ivermectin, albendazole, praziquantel). Secnidazole is the nitroimidazole with the longest half-life and is, therefore, used in single dose treatments for Giardia, acute intestinal amoebiasis and E. histolytica cyst carriers. Single dose treatments of most intestinal parasites will be a major advance in the management of tropical infectious diarrhoea.

As health systems have become more experienced in dealing with the pandemic, and as the proportion of the population vaccinated rises, it is of interest to determine whether the prevalence of AIS hospitalization and outcomes from hospitalization have returned to normal.Patients and methods:In this observational, retrospective cohort study, we compared the prevalence and outcomes of AIS during the first four waves of the pandemic to corresponding pre-pandemic periods in 2019 using administrative data collected from a nationwide network of 76 hospitals that manages 7% of all in-hospital cases in Germany.Results:We included 25,821 AIS cases in the study period (2020/2021) and used 26,295 AIS cases as controls (2019). Compared to pre-pandemic numbers, mean daily AIS admissions decreased only during wave 1 (from 39.6 to 34.1;p?<?0.01) and wave 2 (from 39.9 to 38.3;p?=?0.03) and returned to normal levels during waves 3 and 4. AIS case fatality increased in wave 1 only (from 6.0% to 7.6%;p?=?0.03). We observed a consistent decrease in the prevalences of arterial hypertension, diabetes, and obesity among AIS cases throughout the pandemic and no changes in rates of systemic thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, or decompressive craniectomy. The rate of transfer to stroke units increased only during waves 2 (by 4.6%;p?<?0.01) and 3 (by 3.0%;p?<?0.01). The proportion of patients with coinciding SARS-CoV-2 and AIS was low, peaking at 3.4% in wave 2 and subsequently decreasing to 0.4% in wave 4.Conclusion:In Germany, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have had a larger effect on nationwide in-hospital AIS care during the early pandemic stages, in which AIS case numbers decreased and case fatality rose.

However, the simulations can be computationally expensive, and few validation and sensitivity studies have been reported. The objectives of this study are to validate LES of wind-driven cross-ventilation and to quantify the sensitivity of the solution to the grid resolution and the inflow boundary conditions. We perform LES for an isolated building with two openings, using three different grid resolutions and two different inflow conditions with varying turbulence intensities. Predictions of the ventilation rate are compared to a reference wind-tunnel experiment available from literature, and we also quantify the age of air and ventilation efficiency. The results show that a sufficiently fine grid resolution is needed to provide accurate predictions of the detailed flow pattern and the age of air, while the inflow condition is found to affect the standard deviation of the instantaneous ventilation rate. However, for the cross-ventilation case modeled in this paper, the prediction of the mean ventilation flow rate is very robust, showing negligible sensitivity to the grid resolution or the inflow characteristics.","output":"Large-eddy simulations of wind-driven cross ventilation, Part1: validation and sensitivity study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spread widely in the world, causing a huge threat to people's living environment.

Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a challenge to the worlds mental health and health care systems. Considering that traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our populations mental health. Many people in the United States now use social media platforms such as Twitter to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field to understand personal well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to answer three research questions: (1) What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19? (2) To what extent did social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? and (3) Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n=354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool. RESULTS: LDA topics generated in the early months of the data set corresponded to major COVID-19Cspecific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted toward US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis scores of user timelines were initially high and stable but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased use rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media use on mental health, social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term for many individuals. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental health care structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.","output":"Social Media Insights Into US Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Analysis of Twitter Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In India, 15 nutrition interventions are delivered and financed through the National Health Mission (NHM). Programmatic know\\\\how, however, on tracking nutrition budgets in health sector plans is limited. Following the four phases of the budget cycleplanning, allocations, disbursements and expenditure, this paper presents a new method developed by the authors to track nutrition budgets within health sector plans. Using the example of the Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) or Anemia Free India strategy, it reports preliminary findings on the application of the first two phases of the method, that is, to track and act for improved planning and allocations, covering 12 states. The paper lists out the budget heads, cost norms and developed tools to plan adequately. Supportive action was undertaken through sharing trends and trainings for AMB's budgeting to create opportunities for improvements. It was observed that the AMB budget increased over 3 years despite the COVID situation. It increased from INR 6184 million in FY 2019C2020 to INR 6293 million, a 2% increase in FY 2020C2021, and to INR 7433 million, an 18% increase in FY 2021C2022. The difference in allocations and planned budgets were low (16%, 4% and 11%, respectively) while the difference in required budgets and planned budgets were significant but reduced consistently (41%, 31% and 22%, respectively).

To assess the ability of vaccinated COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP-V) collected before November 2021 to seroneutralize Omicron, we compared neutralizing antibody (nAb) titres of 63 samples against Omicron and earlier B.1 (D614G) strains. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Relationship between anti-Omicron titres and IgG anti-S1 levels (binding arbitrary unit: BAU/ml) was studied. Although correlated, anti-Omicron titres were significantly lower than anti-B.1 titres (median = 80 [10-1280] vs. 1280 [160-10,240], p < 0.0001). Omicron nAb titres and IgG anti-S1 levels were correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.67). Anti-S1 IgG threshold at 7000 BAU/ml may allow to discard CCP-V without anti-Omicron activity (nAb titre <40). Conversely, only those with highest titres (160) had systematically anti-S1 IgG levels >7000 BAU/ml. CONCLUSION: A fraction of CCP-V collected before November 2021 retains anti-Omicron seroneutralizing activity that may be selected by quantitative anti-IgG assays, but such assays do not easily allow the identification of 'high-titre' CCP-V.

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on prison staff and prisoners in England and Wales is unknown. Testing for COVID-19 both asymptomatic and symptomatic, as well as for antibodies, to date, has been minimal. The purpose of this paper is to explore the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisons poses philosophical and ethical questions around trust, efficacy and ethicacy. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This paper is both descriptive, providing an overview of the widespread testing of COVID-19 in prisoners in England and Wales, and conceptual in that it discusses and argues the issues associated with large-scale testing. This paper provides a discussion, using comparative studies, of the issues associated with large-scale testing of prisoners across the prison estate in England and Wales (120 prisons). The issues identified in this paper are contextualised through the lens of COVID-19, but they are equally transferrable to epidemiological studies of any pandemic. Given the prevalence of COVID-19 globally and the lack of information about its spread in prisons, at the time of writing this paper, there is a programme of asymptomatic testing of prisoners. However, there remains a paucity of data on the spread of COVID-19 in prisons because of the progress with the ongoing testing programme. FINDINGS: The authors argue that the widespread testing of prisoners requires careful consideration of the details regarding who is included in testing, how consent is gained and how tests are administered. This paper outlines and argues the importance of considering the complex nuance of power relationships within the prison system, among prisoner officers, medical staff and prisoners and the detrimental consequences. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The widespread testing of COVID-19 presents ethical and practical challenges. Careful planning is required when considering the ethics of who should be included in COVID-19 testing, how consent will be gained, who and how tests will be administered and very practical challenges around the recording and assigning of COVID-19 test kits inside the prison. The current system for the general population requires scanning of barcodes and registration using a mobile number; these facilities are not permitted inside a prison. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper looks at the issues associated with mass testing of prisoners for COVID-19. According to the authors' knowledge, there has not been any research that looks at the issues of testing either in the UK or internationally. The literature available details countries' responses to the pandemic rather and scientific papers on the development of vaccines. Therefore, this paper is an original review of some of the practicalities that need to be addressed to ensure that testing can be as successful as possible.","output":"Trust, efficacy and ethicacy when testing prisoners for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeAssessing the impact of hygiene factors on faculty motivation and satisfaction in online teaching will advance the literature. It will especially demystify that both factors (hygiene factors and motivator) can cause job satisfaction in online education. The purpose of this paper is to firstly determine the level of faculty motivation and satisfaction in online teaching. Secondly, this study analyses the extent to which hygiene factors affect motivation and faculty satisfaction with online teaching.Design/methodology/approachThe population of this study consists of university faculty in Indonesia and Malaysia. The sample is randomly chosen in 50 higher education institutions in Indonesia and Malaysia. The sample size is 206. The participants completed a survey, including perceived student engagement, institutional support, motivation, faculty satisfaction and demographical questions. To test the model, PLS-SEM was used using SmartPLS3 software. The hygiene factors construct was operationalized as a second-order construct consisting of first-order construct: student engagement and institutional support.FindingsThere were no statistically significant differences concerning institutional support and motivation by country of residence. However, there were significant differences in student engagement and faculty satisfaction by country residence. Concerning satisfaction and motivation, the most satisfied and motivated was the faculty member in Indonesia. Hygiene factors were found as the antecedent to faculty motivation and faculty motivation multiplying hygiene factors' effect on job satisfaction. The results showed that student engagement has the highest impact on faculty satisfaction, followed by motivation. Work motivation mediates the relationship between hygiene factors and faculty satisfaction.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has limitations;firstly, causal inferences are not warranted as the data is cross-sectional. However, a future direction is to analyse the causal relationship between the hygiene factors, and motivation factors on faculty satisfaction using a formative first-order construct through a longitudinal study. Secondly, the results generalizability is another limitation of this study because the sample comprised only Indonesia and Malaysia faculty across 51 higher education institution in big cities in the island of Java in Indonesia and Malaysia peninsular only;however, the factors determined in this study represent the job-related aspects taken from the literature and the researchers experiences;other parts influence faculty satisfaction with online teaching. Therefore, identifying other elements is a future path.Practical implicationsWhen managers aim at increasing faculty satisfaction, the priority should be given to improve the performance of indicators with the highest effect but a relatively low in performance. All of this implies that higher education institution first needs to find ways to increase motivation by rewarding faculty in many forms, and improve the quality of instruction. Secondly, implementing policies and make some decisions that require an investment such as providing a learning management system.Social implicationsIndonesia and Malaysia higher education institutions may ameliorate faculty satisfaction with online teaching in several ways. Firstly, before the online course begins, higher education institutions should attempt to have faculty believe teaching online is worthwhile and understand the institution itself also believes it is significant. Administer training for faculty, especially regarding increasing connections with and between students, gives faculty the time needed to design an online course and provide faculty with a course management system with multiple capabilities. Secondly, during the online course, higher education institutions should support technical issues and try to have faculty believe they have an accommodating work schedule and independence with the online course.Originality/valueThis research firstly contributes to the iterature by establishing the relationship between hygiene factors and motivation, and hygiene factors and satisfaction, which did not exist according to the two-factor theory in the past. Secondly, the authors provide evidence of motivation constructs as a mediating variable.

Highly sensitive and selective evaluation of the H2O2 concentration is key to customizing the sufficient disinfection process and avoiding disinfection overuse. Amperometric electrochemical detection is an effective means but poses challenges originated from the precarious state of H2O2. Here, an atomic Co-N-x-C site anchored neuronal-like carbon modified amperometric sensor (denoted as the CoSA-N/C@rGO sensor) is designed, which exhibits a broad detection range (from 250 nM to 50 mM), superior sensitivity (743.3 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), the best among carbon-based amperometric sensors), strong selectivity (no response to interferents), powerful reliability (only 2.86% decay for one week) and fast response (just 5 s) for residual H2O2 detection. We validated the accuracy and practicability of the CoSA-N/C@rGO sensor in the actual H2O2 disinfection process of personal protective equipment. Further characterization verifies that the electrocatalytic activity and selective reduction of H2O2 is determined by the atomically dispersed Co-N-x-C sites and the high oxygen content of CoSA-N/C@rGO, where the response time and reliability of H2O2 detection is determined by the neuronal-like structure with high nitrogen content. Our findings pave the way for developing a sensor with superior sensitivity, selectivity and stability, rendering promising applications such as medical care and environmental treatment.","output":"Detecting residual chemical disinfectant using an atomic Co-N-x-C anchored neuronal-like carbon catalyst modified amperometric sensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highly pathogenic respiratory viruses such as 1918 influenza (HIN1) and coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) induce significant lung injury with diffuse alveolar damage, capillary leak, and extensive cell death resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Direct effects of the virus, as well as host immune response such as proinflammatory cytokine production, contribute to programmed cell death or apoptosis. Alveolar lung epithelial type II (AT2) cells play a major role in the clearance of respiratory viruses, secretion of surfactant proteins and antimicrobial substances into the bronchoalveolar fluid as well as repair of lung injury. Gene expression in AT2 cells is regulated in a tissue and cell-specific manner and in a temporal fashion. The availability of tissue and cell-specific RNA datasets in Human Protein Atlas led to the identification of localized expression patterns of BCL-2 family members such as BCL2 related protein A1 (BCL2A1) in AT2 cells and immune cells of the lung. BCL2A1 expression was regulated by multiple stimuli including Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, interferons (IFNs), inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited by the steroid dexamethasone. In this study, regulation of BCL2A1 gene expression in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses and type I interferon signaling was investigated. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly induced BCL2A1 expression in human lung epithelial cells within 24 hours that required the expression of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). BCL2A1 mRNA induction by SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with the induced expression of IFN- and IFN-regulated transcription factor mRNA. BCL2A1 was induced by IFN- treatment or by infection with influenza virus lacking the non-structural protein1(NS1) in NHBE cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics revealed that a subset of BCL-2 family members involved in the control of apoptosis and transcription such as BCL2A1, BCL2L14, BCL3, and BCL6 were regulated in the lung epithelial cells by coronaviruses and in the lung tissue samples of COVID-19 patients.

Here, we identified protein kinase R (PKR) as an innate immune sensor for proteotoxic stress. PKR activation was observed in cellular models of decreased proteasome function and in multiple cell types from patients with proteasome-associated autoinflammatory disease (PRAAS). Furthermore, genetic deletion or small-molecule inhibition of PKR in vitro ameliorated inflammation driven by proteasome deficiency. In vivo, proteasome inhibitor-induced inflammatory gene transcription was blunted in PKR-deficient mice compared with littermate controls. PKR also acted as a rheostat for proteotoxic stress by triggering phosphorylation of eIF2, which can prevent the translation of new proteins to restore homeostasis. Although traditionally known as a sensor of RNA, under conditions of proteasome dysfunction, PKR sensed the cytoplasmic accumulation of a known interactor, interleukin-24 (IL-24). When misfolded IL-24 egress into the cytosol was blocked by inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, PKR activation and subsequent inflammatory signaling were blunted. Cytokines such as IL-24 are normally secreted from cells; therefore, cytoplasmic accumulation of IL-24 represents an internal danger-associated molecular pattern. Thus, we have identified a mechanism by which proteotoxic stress is detected, causing inflammation observed in the disease PRAAS.","output":"Protein kinase R is an innate immune sensor of proteotoxic stress via accumulation of cytoplasmic IL-24"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: While many seroprevalence studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been performed, few are demographically representative. This investigation focused on defining the nature and frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a representative, cross-sectional sample of communities in Louisiana, USA. METHODS: A sample of 4778 adults from New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana were given a survey of symptoms and co-morbidities, nasopharyngeal swab to test for active infection (PCR), and blood draw to test for past infection (IgG). Odds ratios, cluster analysis, quantification of virus and antibody, and linear modelling were used to understand whether certain symptoms were associated with a positive test, how symptoms grouped together, whether virus or antibody varied by symptom status, and whether being symptomatic was different across the age span. RESULTS: Reported anosmia/ageusia was strongly associated with a positive test; 40.6% (93/229) tested positive versus 4.8% (218/4549) positivity in those who did not report anosmia/ageusia (OR 13.6, 95% CI 10.1-18.3). Of the people who tested positive, 47.3% (147/311) were completely asymptomatic. Symptom presentation clustered into three groups; low/no symptoms (0.4  0.9, mean  SD), highly symptomatic (7.5  1.9) or moderately symptomatic (4.0  1.5). Quantity of virus was lower in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic group (cycle number 23.3  8.3 versus 17.3  9.0; p < 0.001). Modelling the probability of symptoms showed changes with age; the highest probability of reporting symptoms was 64.6% (95% CI 50.4-76.5) at age 29 years, which decreased to a probability of 49.3% (95% CI 36.6-62.0) at age 60 years and only 25.1% (95% CI 5.0-68.1) at age 80 years. CONCLUSION: Anosmia/ageusia can be used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection from other illnesses, and, given the high ratio of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing should include those without symptoms. Regular testing in congregant settings of those over age 60 years may help mitigate asymptomatic spread.","output":"The importance of anosmia, ageusia and age in community presentation of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Louisiana, USA; a cross-sectional prevalence study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Beijing, China, is summarized.

The relationship between the two principles and the Prophetic traditions can thus be made clear. The research employs the analytical qualitative method using library-based research, examination of both primary sources of Islamic legislation (the Quran and the Sunna) and secondary sources (classical and modern literature of Muslim scholars). The research finds that there are a number of Prophetic traditions that mention medical immunization and quarantine.

Health care personnel (HCP), first responders, and other essential and frontline workers (OEWs) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection because of frequent close contact with others. OBJECTIVE: The Arizona Healthcare, Emergency Response, and Other Essential Workers Study (AZ HEROES) aims to examine the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness among adults with high occupational exposure risk. Study objectives include estimating the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers by symptom presentation and demographic factors, determining independent effects of occupational and community exposures on incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, establishing molecular and immunologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers, describing the duration and patterns of real-time reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) positivity, and examining postvaccine immunologic response. METHODS: Eligible participants include Arizona residents aged 18 to 85 years who work at least 20 hours per week in an occupation involving regular direct contact (ie, within 3 feet) with others. Recruitment goals are stratified by demographic characteristics (50% aged 40 years or older, 50% women, and 50% Hispanic or American Indian), by occupation (40% HCP, 30% first responders, and 30% OEWs), and by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (with up to 50% seropositive at baseline). Information on sociodemographics, health and medical history, vaccination status, exposures to individuals with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, use of personal protective equipment, and perceived risks are collected at enrollment and updated through quarterly surveys. Every week, participants complete active surveillance for COVID-like illness (CLI) and self-collect nasal swabs. Additional self-collected nasal swab and saliva specimens are collected in the event of CLI onset. Respiratory specimens are sent to Marshfield Laboratories and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR assay. CLI symptoms and impact on work and productivity are followed through illness resolution. Serum specimens are collected every 3 months and additional sera are collected following incident rRT-PCR positivity and after each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections will be calculated by person-weeks at risk and compared by occupation and demographic characteristics as well as by seropositivity status and infection and vaccination history. RESULTS: The AZ HEROES study was funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Enrollment began on July 27, 2020; as of May 1, 2021, a total of 3165 participants have been enrolled in the study. Enrollment is expected to continue through December 1, 2021, with data collection continuing through at least April 2022, contingent upon funding. CONCLUSIONS: AZ HEROES is unique in aiming to recruit a diverse sample of essential workers and to prospectively follow strata of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative and seropositive adults. Survey results combined with active surveillance data on exposure, CLI, weekly molecular diagnostic testing, and periodic serology will be used to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, assess the intensity and durability of immune responses to natural infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and contribute to the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.

This issue may be of particular concern to those affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a California state-representative online survey conducted in the two weeks following the state stay-at-home order, enacted March 19, 2020 (unweighted N = 2081). We conducted a series of multivariate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the associations between a) time since stay-at-home order and b) partner and sexual violence exposure ever with our outcomes of interest: depression and/or anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks. Covariates included demographics and social support. FINDINGS: Nearly one in five (19?7%) respondents reported moderate or severe mental health symptoms in the past two weeks; 15?5% had a history of IPV and 10?1% had a history of sexual violence. In models adjusting for gender, partner and sexual violence history, and other demographics, time was significantly associated with greater mental health symptom severity, as were IPV and sexual violence. When we additionally adjusted for current social support, effects of time were lost and effects related to violence were slightly attenuated. INTERPRETATION: Time under shutdown is associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety symptoms, and may be worse for those with a history of IPV. However, those with greater social support appear to have better capacity to withstand the mental health impacts of the pandemic. Social support programs, inclusive of those available virtually, may offer an important opportunity to help address increased mental health concerns we are seeing under the pandemic.

However, the transmission of hepatitis B in the 1970s and of hepatitis C and HIV in the 1980s through plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates had catastrophic consequences for hemophilia patients. Thus, due to regulatory concerns about the inherent potential for transmission of infectious agents as well as the heterogeneity and lack of reliability of the serum supply, a trend has emerged to eliminate the use of plasma-derived additives in the production and formulation of recombinant protein therapeutics. This practice began with products used in the treatment of hemophilia and is progressively expanding throughout the entire industry.

These conditions include: the economic conditions, the infrastructure, the political and legal system, the business environment, and the socio-cultural environment. For a foreign investor, the motive for exporting capital abroad is the search for benefits that can be derived from the business activity conducted there, including easier entry into new markets. Purpose of the article: The main aim of the paper is to distinguish groups of voivodeships (NUTS 2 level) that are relatively homogeneous in terms of investment attractiveness, which is conducive to the inflow of foreign capital and the implementation of investment projects involving foreign capital. Methods: Distinguishing groups of voivodeships similar to each other in terms of the level of investment attractiveness is made by applying hierarchical cluster analysis. The dendrogram illustrates the hierarchical structure of clusters of similar objects according to the analysed set of variables. The quality of the clustering result is also assessed by determining the silhouette index. Comparative and descriptive analysis of CSO statistics are additional methods used that have contributed to the achievement of the aim of the paper. The research period covers the years 2000-2018. Findings & value added: The investment attractiveness of a voivodeship is closely related to the level of its economic development. Therefore, the following voivodeships are listed at the top of the investment attractiveness rankings: Mazowieckie, Dolnoslaskie, Slaskie, Malopolskie, and Pomorskie. The conducted study has confirmed that the creation of special economic zones and the development of regional smart specialisations contribute to the inflow of foreign capital. It is worth noting that the assessment of investment attractiveness is relative.

Materials and methods: This cross-sectional mixed methods study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown in AprilCMay 2020. Undocumented and recently regularized migrants taking part in an ongoing cohort study were asked to respond to an online questionnaire. A subsample was selected to undergo semi-directed phone interviews. Results: Overall, 117 of the 379 (30.9%) cohort study participants responded to the questionnaire. Seventeen interviews were conducted. Migrants faced cumulative and rapidly progressive difficulties in essential life domains. As a consequence, they showed high prevalence of exposure to COVID-19, poor mental health along with frequent avoidance of health care. Moreover, the loss of working hours and the related income overlapped with frequent food and housing insecurity. Around one participant in four had experienced hunger. Despite these unmet needs, half of the participants had not sought external assistance for reasons that differ by legal status. Both groups felt that seeking assistance might represent a threat for the renewal or a future application for a residency permit. While documented migrants were less severely affected in some domains by having accumulated more reserves previously, they also frequently renounced to sources of support. Conclusions: The cumulated difficulties faced by migrants in this period of crisis and their limited search for assistance highlight the need to implement trust-building strategies to bridge the access gap to sources of support along with policies protecting them against the rapid loss of income, the risk of losing their residency permit and the exposure to multi-fold insecurities.","output":"The Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Lockdown on the Health and Living Conditions of Undocumented Migrants and Migrants Undergoing Legal Status Regularization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the global outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, \\"cytokine storm\\" conditions are regarded as the fatal step resulting in most mortality.

The main focus is on the acute care of people suffering from COVID-19. One way to maintain these essential health services in the field of dermatology and at the same time to contribute to a reduction of the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 by social distancing could be offered by telemedical services [1]. Telemedicine (e-health) is the use of telecommunication technologies for the exchange of medical information for diagnosis, consultation, therapy and teaching. Dermatology is particularly suitable for telemedical diagnosis and consultation due to its image-based orientation in diagnostics. Two technologies are predominantly used in dermatological telemedicine (teledermatology): Store- -and-Forward (SAF) technology, in which clinical images and additional information are evaluated spatially dispersed with a time delay (asynchronous procedure), and video conferencing, in which dermatological image-based diagnosis and consultation take place synchronously [1]. A teledermatological consultation can be carried out directly for patients, but also in an intra-medical dialogue for physicians of other disciplines (teleconsultation). Besides pure medical aspects, teledermatological practices entail a number of specific legal problems that are especially crucial and relevant in times of the COVID-19 outbreak [2]. Such issues as data privacy, confidentiality and patients' autonomy during teledermatological consultations are of a crucial importance both on the EU and US legislation [2, 3]. One might outline the problems of a general under development of the legal basis concerning teledermatological treatment and a lack of a special regulation of the topic at the EU level [2, 3]. Dermatologists in hospitals and practices were able to compensate at least partially for the restrictions of personal dermatological care of patients with skin diseases under the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic by an extension of teledermatological services (video consultation, SAF teledermatology). Findings from the use of teledermatology during the pandemic should be used to further improve the use of teledermatology, for which the structural framework conditions in the health care system must be created. The use of teledermatological instruments during the COVID-19 pandemic has pointed out the need to develop and concretize the legal basis in the mentioned field.","output":"Teledermatology during the COVID-19 pandemic-medical and legal aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To adapt the ICU Mobility Scale (IMS) to the area of intensive care units (ICU) in Spain and to evaluate the metric properties of the Spanish version of the IMS (IMS-Es). METHOD: Descriptive metric study developed in two phases. Phase 1, adaptation to Spanish of the IMS by a team of nurses and physiotherapists (translation, pilot, backtranslation and agreement). Phase 2, analysis of metric properties (convergent, divergent and predictive validity, interobserver reliability, sensitivity and minimum important difference) of the IMS-Es. Patient characteristics (Barthel, Charlson, BMI, sex), sedation/agitation level (RASS), ICU and hospital stays, survival, quality of life (SF-12), muscle weakness (MRC-SS) and mobility (IMS-Es) were recorded in the patients of the MOviPre national multicentre study. RESULTS: After obtaining the IMS-Es, it was implemented in 645 patients from 80 Spanish ICUs between April and June 2017. Convergent validity: moderate correlation between IMS-Es and MRC-SS (r=.389; P<.001) and significant comparison between groups with and without ICU-acquired weakness (P<.001). Divergent validity: no correlation between IMS-Es and BMI [r (95%CI): -.112 (-.232 to .011)], weight [r (95%CI): -.098 (-.219 to .026)], Charlson [r (95%CI): -.122 (-.242 to .001)] and Barthel [r(95%CI): -.037 (-.160 to .087)] and no differences between sexes (P=.587) or BMI categories (P=.412).

They may be related to the techniques used to divide the tissue. We designed a randomized clinical trial to compare the cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) and an endoscopic stapler device applied in routine clinical hepatic surgical practice. METHODS All consecutive patients admitted for elective hepatic resective surgery--at least bisegmentectomy of the liver--were assessed for enrollment in the study. A total of 100 patients were subsequently randomized. There was a good balance between the study groups concerning issues that may be of relevance for the perioperative and postoperative courses. The primary objective of the study was to achieve an approximately 25 % reduction in perioperative blood loss and postoperative bile leakage. Secondary outcome variables were operating time, general postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay, and direct medical costs. RESULTS The amount of perioperative or postoperative blood loss did not differ significantly between the two groups. We observed a trend toward shorter transection and operating time for patients in whom staplers were used, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The postoperative courses were close to identical in the respective study arms with no difference in bile leakage rates or in the total morbidity profiles. The direct medical costs were nonsignificantly lower in the group where staplers were used for liver transection. CONCLUSIONS The results show that the use of endoscopic vascular staplers in liver surgery is feasible and safe. It offers an attractive alternative for division of the liver parenchyma during routine hepatic surgery, being comparable to the use of CUSA without adding extra costs.","output":"Transection of the liver parenchyma with an ultrasound dissector or a stapler device: results of a randomized clinical study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to explore the effects of propofol anesthesia system based on block chain on brain tissue and brain function protection, 88 patients undergoing craniocerebral trauma surgery are selected for prospective study.

The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. METHODS: During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). CONCLUSION: Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health.

Chest X-ray is currently accepted to be one of the reliable means for such a detection purpose. However, most of the available methods utilize large training data, and there is a need for improvement in the detection accuracy due to the limited boundary segment of the acquired images for symptom identifications. In this study, a robust and efficient method based on transfer learning techniques is proposed to identify normal and COVID-19 patients by employing small training data. Transfer learning builds accurate models in a timesaving way. First, data augmentation was performed to help the network for memorization of image details. Next, five state-of-the-art transfer learning models, AlexNet, MobileNetv2, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and Xception, with three optimizers, Adam, SGDM, and RMSProp, were implemented at various learning rates, 1e-4, 2e-4, 3e-4, and 4e-4, to reduce the probability of overfitting. All the experiments were performed on publicly available datasets with several analytical measurements attained after execution with a 10-fold cross-validation method. The results suggest that MobileNetv2 with Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 3e-4 provides an average accuracy, recall, precision, and F-score of 97%, 96.5%, 97.5%, and 97%, respectively, which are higher than those of all other combinations.

The previous outbreak, which was due to the B.1.411 virus (Sri Lankan lineage) resulted in a significantly fewer number of cases and deaths compared to the current outbreak caused by B.1.1.7. Therefore, we sought to explore if the differences in the transmission rates and higher mortality rates with the introduction of B.1.1.7 is due to an increased expression of sub-genomic RNA, which is an essential step in the virus life cycle. Methods & Materials Sputum or nasopharyngeal samples of 472 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the analysis. Samples with the cycle threshold <30, were sequenced using 247 amplicons targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome (MN908947v3). Library preparation was done using AmpliSeq prep kit and sequenced either on illumina iSeq100 or Nextseq550 platforms. Basecalling and demultiplexing were done using the default bcl2fastq (v2.20) pipeline. Raw index-trimmed fastqs were analyzed for sub-genomic RNA using Periscope (https://github.com/sheffield-bioinformatics-core/periscope). Raw reads were aligned and checked for the leader sequence at the start of each open reading frame (ORF). The sgRNA detected reads were counted, classified into ORFs and normalized using the genomic RNA counts at each position. Groups were compared with an unpaired Wilcoxon test using R\\\\rstatix package. Figures were generated in R\\\\ggpubr. Results Out of the remaining 434 datasets after the quality control step, 164 were of B.1.1.7 lineage while 237 were B.1.4.11. Means of the normalized sgRNA counts between B.1.411 and B.1.1.7 viruses were significantly different in six ORFs. Viruses of the B.1.411 lineage expressed significantly higher sgRNA for Spike protein (p = 0.014), ORF3a (p = 0. 0001), Membrane protein (p = 3.62E-10), ORF8 (p = 1.81E-05), and ORF7a (p = 0.0004) than those in B.1.1.7 samples. Contrastingly, Nucleocapsid (N) protein had significantly higher sgRNA expression in B.1.1.7 samples (p=0.0001). Conclusion Our results suggest that increased expression of sgRNA for a particular virus lineage does not necessarily associate with higher transmissibility as higher expression of sgRNA of B.1.1.7 compared to the B.1.411 lineage virus was only seen for the N protein.","output":"Sub-genomic RNA Expression in SARS-CoV-2 B.1.411 and B.1.1.7 Infections in Sri Lanka"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019, a number of medications have been used to treat the infection and the related Coronavirus disease C 19 (COVID-19).

Presented herein is the initial comparison of LESS donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN) and standard laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN). OBJECTIVE To determine whether LESS-DN provides any measurable benefit over LLDN during the perioperative period and subsequent convalescence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between November 2007 and November 2008, 18 consecutive patients underwent LESS-DN (17 left DN, 1 right DN). A contemporary matched-pair cohort of 17 patients undergoing standard LLDN was selected for retrospective comparison. INTERVENTIONS LESS-DN was performed through an intraumbilical novel multichannel port. The kidney was extracted through a slightly extended umbilical incision. MEASUREMENTS All data were prospectively accrued in an institutional review board-approved database. Convalescence data included visual analog pain scores and questionnaires containing patient-reported time to recovery end points. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS One right-sided donor was converted to standard laparoscopy and excluded from analysis. Baseline demographics, operating time, blood loss, and hospital stay were comparable between groups. Compared to LLDN, patients undergoing LESS-DN had similar in-hospital analgesic requirements and mean visual analog scores at discharge. After discharge, patient-reported convalescence was faster in the LESS-DN group, including days on oral pain medication (20 vs 6; p=0.01), days off work (46 vs 18; p=0.0009), and days to 100% physical recovery (83 vs 29; p=0.03). Mean warm ischemia time was longer in the LESS-DN group (3 vs 6.1 min; p<0.0001); however, allograft function was immediate and comparable between groups. One allograft in the LESS-DN group thrombosed postoperatively. Regardless of laparoscopic approach, patients' global satisfaction with kidney donation and willingness to recommend their procedure to others were favorable and equivalent between groups. CONCLUSIONS This retrospective matched-pair comparison between LESS-DN and LLDN suggests that the single-port approach may be associated with quicker convalescence.

A subgroup analysis of patients with ABW/IBW > 120% was conducted to compare in-hospital mortality between patients with ABW/IBW 121-149%, ABW/IBW 150-199%, and ABW/IBW  200%. RESULTS: A total of 445 patients were included of which 71% were in the ABW/IBW > 120% group. Patients in the ABW/IBW  120% group had higher median age (71 [IQR 64-80.5] vs 60 [IQR 50-70] years) compared to those in the ABW/IBW > 120% group. Fewer African Americans and females were in the ABW/IBW  120% than in the ABW/IBW > 120% group (65% vs 86% and 35% vs 64%, respectively). There was no difference in the rate of in-hospital mortality between patients in the ABW/IBW  120% and ABW/IBW > 120% group (26% vs 20%, p=0.174). Average LOS was 10.5 days (SD 9.2) for patients in the ABW/IBW  120% and 9.3 days (SD 9.5) for those in the ABW/IBW > 120% group (p=0.227). Among those in the ABW/IBW > 120% group, in-hospital mortality was 14%, 23%, and 22% in patients with ABW/IBW 121-149%, ABW/IBW 150-199%, and ABW/IBW  200%, respectively (p=0.192). CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality and LOS were not significantly higher among COVID-19 patients with excess weight, defined by ABW/IBW > 120%, when compared to those with ABW/IBW  120%. Further research is needed to compare COVID-19 outcomes when BMI and ABW/IBW are used to define excess weight. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"298.

The vaccine candidate elicited strong antigenicity in dogs in respect of specific SGE and Leishmania humoral immune response. The major saliva proteins recognized by serum from immunized dogs exhibited molecular weights of 35 and 45 kDa, and were related to the resistance pattern against Leishmania infection. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed increased circulating CD21(+) B-cells and CD5(+) T-cells, reflected by higher counts of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. The observed interaction between potential antigen-presenting cells (evaluated as CD14(+) monocytes) and lymphocyte activation status indicated a relationship between innate and adaptive immune responses. The higher frequency in L. chagasi antigen-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, and their positive association with intense cell proliferation, in addition to the progressively higher production of serum nitric oxide levels, showed a profile compatible with anti-CVL vaccine potential. Further studies on immunological response after challenge with L. chagasi may provide important information that will lead to a better understanding on vaccine trial and efficacy.","output":"A killed Leishmania vaccine with sand fly saliva extract and saponin adjuvant displays immunogenicity in dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter explores the Bosnian war and the post-war political conflicts to set the scene for Bosnian victims struggle for redress that forms the rest of the book. It introduces three post-war phases that frame Bosnian politics and victims struggle. The first phase from 1995 to 1999 was defined by emergency post-war stabilization when victims started forming their associations and organizing first advocacy campaigns under the wider umbrella of truth and justice. In the second phase that lasted until approximately 2006 centralization efforts and external state-building dominated local politics. This was also a period when victims sought out international and domestic allies to press for dramatic changes in their redress. In the last phase that followed, a two steps forward, three steps back pattern of progress could be observed, accompanied by flawed Europeanization and re-nationalization of politics. Victims struggle grew into polarizing movements and inter-group animosities. A key goal became the pursuit of a formal status, i.e. a legal recognition of a victim group as eligible for material and in-kind support. Just like politics, victims struggle started to be dominated by nationalism and hierarchies of suffering.

It is important to examine impact of the lockdown on the elderly and their caregivers, useful coping strategies and requirements for support going forwards. Method As part of an ongoing community engagement initiative with older adults, an online survey was conducted in 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic investigating mental health and wellbeing of older adults. Participants who shared details were contacted one year later to understand impact of the second COIVD wave on their wellbeing and coping. An in-depth telephonic interview was conducted and General Health Questionnaire 5 item were used for data collection. Audio consent was taken prior to interviews which were recorded and transcribed for thematic analysis. Result Out of 58 participants who shared contact details, 16 % (N=9) agreed to participate in the interview. about 40 % refused mentioning they were unwell/ too busy/or agreed to speak at a later date. One female and 8 males participated in the interview between the ages of 36 to 83 years. All participants held post graduate/ professional degrees. 33 % (N=3) participants obtained a GHQ score of 2 and above on the five item General Health Questionnaire indicating presence of depressive features. As compared to the first lockdown, older adults found the second lockdown more stressful due to deaths of close friends and family members. Increased fears about family members with comorbidities contracting the virus, difficulties managing emotional wellbeing, and challenges helping younger family members manage their routines and follow basic COVID protocols were key concerns. Coping strategies found useful were remaining active and engaged at home, attending online mental wellness sessions, practicing yoga/ meditation and spending time with friends/family. Older adults highlighted a need for more emotional support through creation of social media networks and online platforms. Conclusion Preliminary findings from this study emphasize a need for leveraging technology to support emotional wellbeing of older adults during lockdown and COVID restrictions.","output":"Concerns of older adults during second COVID wave in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In Spring 2020 many academic institutions transitioned to remote learning in response to the developing COVID-19 pandemic. These changes affected skills-based training, as schools of pharmacy were forced to transition traditionally in-person assessments to a remote setting. The purpose of this article is to describe the experience of pharmacy skills lab coordinators when transitioning summative skills-based assessments (SSBA). Methods: A web-based survey instrument administered through QualtricsXM was sent to all institutions in the Big Ten Academic Alliance-Performance Based Assessment Collaborative. Only one member from each institution completed the survey on behalf of the institution. The survey consisted of four sections: changes made to skills evaluated; changes made to the delivery of those evaluations; challenges to and strategies used by the skills lab program when switching to remote learning; and recommendations for incorporating remote learning within future SSBAs. Survey respondents were invited to participate in an optional unstructured interview regarding survey answers. Results: Nine of ten invited institutions responded to the survey. Of the nine respondents, three participated in the post-survey interview. Overall, 79.5% (93/117) of skills planned to be assessed were assessed with or without modification, with 8.5% (93/117) of skills canceled and 10.3% (12/117) of skills assessments postponed. The most common challenges mentioned were the lack of preparation time, inability to assess certain skills virtually, and student barriers. The most common recommendations made were to prioritize lab components and incorporate flexibility in planning and scheduling. Discussion: The results indicate that most skills were still assessed during the Spring 2020 semester. Though the transition to remote learning was challenging and unique for each institution, common strategies and recommendations identified here provide opportunities for academics to analyze and prioritize learning objectives and to rethink how to develop and deliver SSBAs as remote assessments.","output":"Changes to summative skills-based assessments within the Big Ten Academic Alliance Performance-Based Assessment Collaborative (BTAA-PBAC) due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many respiratory infections around the world have been caused by coronaviruses. COVID-19 is one of the most serious coronaviruses due to its rapid spread between people and the lowest survival rate. There is a high need for computer-assisted diagnostics (CAD) in the area of artificial intelligence to help doctors and radiologists identify COVID-19 patients in cloud systems. Machine learning (ML) has been used to examine chest X-ray frames. In this paper, a new transfer learning-based optimized extreme deep learning paradigm is proposed to identify the chest X-ray picture into three classes, a pneumonia patient, a COVID-19 patient, or a normal person. First, three different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (resnet18, resnet25, densenet201) are employed for deep feature extraction. Second, each feature vector is passed through the binary Butterfly optimization algorithm (bBOA) to reduce the redundant features and extract the most representative ones, and enhance the performance of the CNN models. These selective features are then passed to an improved Extreme learning machine (ELM) using a BOA to classify the chest X-ray images. The proposed paradigm achieves a 99.48% accuracy in detecting covid-19 cases. ? 2021 Tech Science Press.

Therefore, the development and application of nano-/micro-motors based on metalCorganic frameworks with nanozyme activity (abbreviated as: MOF-NZs) in biomedical activities have received much interest recently. Therefore, after investigating the catalytic properties and applications of MOF-NZs in the treatment of cancer, this study intends to point out their key role in the production of biocompatible nano-/micro-motors. Since reducing the toxicity of MOF-NZ nano-/micro-motors can pave the way for medical activities, this article examines the methods of making biocompatible nanomotors to address the benefits and drawbacks of the required propellants. In the following, an analysis of the amplified directional motion of MOF-NZ nano-/micro-motors under physiological conditions is presented, which can improve the motor behaviors in the propulsion function, conductivity, targeting, drug release, and possible elimination. Meanwhile, by explaining the use of MOF-NZ nano-/micro-motors in the treatment of cancer through the possible synergy of nanomotors with different therapies, it was revealed that MOF-NZ nano-/micro-motors can be effective in the treatment of cancer. Ultimately, by analyzing the potential challenges of MOF-NZ nano-/micro-motors in the treatment of cancers, we hope to encourage researchers to develop MOF-NZs-based nanomotors, in addition to opening up new ideas to address ongoing problems.

COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus not been previously identified in humans. METHODS: Two key factors, case incidence and case morbidity, were analysed for England. When taken together they give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, %age >16, at fulltime work/education, %age over 60, %BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD2019, location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as %self-confident in their own long-term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. RESULTS: The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation but it currently shows that Urban, %Working, and age >60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative healthcare impact was wide with 80% of practices falling at 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included we found that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health/social care resources across the world. This model provides a way of predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria, thereby providing a method for targeting limited care resources to optimise national/regional/local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"COVID-19: Generate and apply local modelled transmission and morbidity effects to provide an estimate of the variation in overall relative healthcare resource impact at general practice granularity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic commenced widespread usage of face masks.

It causes severe respiratory syndromes which is one of the leading causes of death. Evidence shows that the novel SARS-CoV-2 has close similarities with other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. So, SARS-CoV-2 might use the similar mechanisms of these viruses to attack the host cells. The severity of COVID-19 is associated with various factors, one of the major reasons is immune dysregulation or immune suppression. Immunity plays a significant role in maintaining the body in a healthy condition. In order to induce a timely immune response against the invaded pathogens, both innate and adaptive immunity must be in an active state. During the viral infection, there will be an excessive generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm and also, the antiviral agents in the body gets inhibited or inactivated through viral mechanisms. Thus, this might be the reason for the transition from mild symptoms to more severe medical conditions which leads to an immediate need for the invention of a new medicine.This review aims to show the host-viral interaction along with immune response, antiviral mechanism and effectiveness of oral low dose cytokines against the virus as a therapeutic approach.","output":"Biochemical and immunological aspects of COVID-19 infection and therapeutical intervention of oral low dose cytokine therapy: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak represents a global health emergency, and dialysis patients are a high-risk population. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in hemodialysis facilities require specific protocols to be planned and promptly executed for the management of suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19 with respect to prevention, protection, screening, and isolation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in our Hemodialysis Unit, we adopted individual protection measures accompanied by measures to minimize contacts among hemodialysis patients with suspicious symptoms as well as other patients and medical staff. We provided our patients detailed instructions to be followed in the event of their having symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection or having contacts with SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. Ultimately, four possible scenarios and care paths were developed and implemented in collaboration with the Infectious Diseases and Emergency Units at the Padua University Hospital. RESULTS: The application of this strategy has resulted in the nearly 200 patients treated in our hemodialysis facilities while there were only 2 cases of COVID-19 (1% incidence rate) with no deaths.

We applied the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines by searching for articles published between January 2010 and December 2020. In addition, we used the respondent-driven sampling method and conducted a telephone survey from October 2019 to February 2020 among representatives from national public health institutes from all African countries. We combined the findings and used a hierarchical clustering method to group the tools based on their functionalities (attributes). RESULTS: We identified 30 tools from 1914 publications and 45 responses from 52% (28/54) of African countries. Approximately 13% of the tools (4/30; Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System, Go.Data, CommCare, and District Health Information Software 2) covered 93% (14/15) of the identified attributes. Of the 30 tools, 17 (59%) tools managed health event data, 20 (67%) managed case-based data, and 28 (97%) offered a dashboard.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study on 241 CHF patients recruited from King Fahd Hospital of the University, Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia (January 2005-December 2016). Their serum sodium and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline, along with 2-D echocardiographic assessments of left ventricular mass and ejection fraction. The primary endpoint was the association between hyponatremia and all-cause mortality (ACM) after a follow-up period of 24 months. Results: Mean age of patients was 60.61  12.63 (SD) years; 65.1% were males, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) was present in 71%. Baseline serum sodium was 138.00 (136, 140) (median and interquartile range). Hyponatremia (<135 meq/L) was present in 14.1%. After follow-up, 46 deaths had occurred. Multivariate Cox-proportional hazard model showed that type 2 DM, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (III-IV vs I-II), age, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were significant and independent predictors of ACM, with HR 3.03 (95% CI; 1.13, 8.16) (P=0.028), HR 2.31 (95% CI; 1.11, 4.82) (P=0.026), HR 1.06 (95% CI; 1.03, 1.09) (P<0.001), and HR 1.01 (95% CI; 1.00, 1.02) (P=0.039), respectively.

However, the overall reduction for the entire patient cohort in that trial was much more modest, indicating highly variable effects of corticosteroid usage among COVID-19 patients. While steroid treatment is known to have both clinical efficacy and detrimental adverse-effects, defining a clinic parameter that could guide the beneficial corticosteroid usage for treating COVID-19 remains an elusive, urgent, and critical unmet need in COVID-19 therapy. Here, we undertook a multicentered retrospective study on a cohort of 12,862 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 21 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, including 3,254 received corticosteroid treatment and 9,608 received usual care without corticosteroid. We uncovered that the clinical benefits of corticosteroid use were closely associated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) measured at admission. Among participants with NLR > 6.12 at admission, corticosteroid treatment was significantly associated with a lower risk of 60-day all-cause mortality of COVID-19 based on both Cox model with time-varying exposure and Marginal Structural Model. However, in patients with NLR  6.12 at admission, corticosteroid treatment was no longer associated with reduced risk of all-cause death, but rather with increased risks of severe adverse effects, particularly in hyperglycemia and infection. In diabetic patients with COVID-19, corticosteroid treatment was associated with increased glycemia, but not with a higher risk of 60-day mortality. Therefore, our study has uncovered NLR as a clinical indicator to stratify COVID-19 patients in their response to corticosteroid therapy.

VE was estimated from May 1, 2021 for incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (weekly life-table hazard rates through September 3) and hospitalizations (monthly incidence rates through August 31). Results: 155,092 COVID-19 cases and 14,862 hospitalizations occurred. Estimated VE for cases declined contemporaneously across age, products, and time-cohorts, from high levels beginning May 1 (1.8% Delta variant prevalence), to a nadir around July 10 (85.3% Delta), with limited changes thereafter (>95% Delta). Decreases were greatest for Pfizer-BioNTech (-24.6%, -19.1%, -14.1% for 18-49, 50-64 years, and []65 years, respectively), and similar for Moderna (-18.0%, -11.6%, -9.0%, respectively) and Janssen (-19.2%, -10.8, -10.9%, respectively). VE for hospitalization for adults 18-64 years was >86% across cohorts, without time trend. Among persons []65 years, VE declined from May to August for Pfizer-BioNTech (95.0% to 89.2%) and Moderna (97.2% to 94.1%). VE was lower for Janssen, without trend, ranging 85.5%-82.8%. Conclusions: Declines in VE for cases may have been primarily driven by factors other than waning. VE for hospitalizations remained high, with modest declines limited to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna recipients []65 years, supporting targeted booster dosing recommendations.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness by Product and Timing in New York State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic symptom of peripheral artery disease, with first line treatment being supervised exercise therapy (SET). Despite this, SET is frequently underutilised, and adherence is often poor. An alternative option are home-based exercise programmes (HBEP). Although HBEPs are well tolerated, to the authors knowledge, no research has assessed their safety. The aim of this review was to assess the safety of HBEPs in people living with IC. We performed an electronic search of the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases. The main parameter of interest was complication rate, calculated as the number of related adverse events per patient-hours. Subanalysis was undertaken to determine differences in safety for studies that did and did not include pre-exercise cardiac screening, and for studies with exercise at low, moderate, and high levels of claudication pain. Our search strategy identified 8693 results, of which 27 studies were included for full review. Studies included 1642 participants completing 147,810 patient-hours of home-based exercise. Four related adverse events were reported, three of which were cardiac in origin, giving an all-cause complication rate of one event per 36,953 patient-hours. Three of these events occurred following exercise to high levels of claudication pain, and one occurred with pain-free exercise. One event occured in a study without cardiac screening. Based on the low number of related adverse events, HBEPs appear to be a safe method of exercise prescription for people with IC. Our results strengthen the rationale for providing alternative exercise options for this population.

Targeting virusChost interactome provides a more effective strategy for antivirus drug discovery compared with targeting virus proteins. In this study, we developed a network-based infrastructure to prioritize promising drug candidates from natural products and approved drugs via targeting host proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We firstly measured the network distances between drug targets and COVID-19 disease module utilizing the network proximity approach, and identified 229 approved drugs as well as 432 natural products had significant associations with SARS-CoV-2. After searching for previous literature evidence, we found that 60.7% (139/229) of approved drugs and 39.6% (171/432) of natural products were confirmed with antivirus or anti-inflammation. We further integrated our network-based predictions and validated anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of some compounds. Four drug candidates, including hesperidin, isorhapontigenin, salmeterol, and gallocatechin-7-gallate, have exhibited activity on SARS-COV-2 virus-infected Vero cells. Finally, we showcased the mechanism of actions of isorhapontigenin and salmeterol via network analysis.

The study took place in Ekaterinburg (Russian Federation). Methods A total of 157 HCWs from three different clinics (56, 60 and 41 HCWs, respectively) who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic period (May to August 2020) constituted the cohort. All of the three chosen clinics had followed COVID-19 screening, triage and other recommendations for safe practice. In addition to using personal protective equipment and other common barrier methods to lower virus transmission, these clinics were equipped with different types of aspirating systems that included V6000 used in dry mode, V6000 used in semi-dry mode and VS900, respectively. All HCWs underwent serological testing once a week to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 using SARS-CoV-2-IgG-EIA-BEST and SARS-CoV-2-IgM-EIA-BEST enzyme immunoassay kits (Vector-Best). Results An overall prevalence of seropositivity was observed to be 11.5% (19/157 HCWs) over a five-month follow-up. The prevalence of infection was not found to be associated with sex or the role of the member in the dental team (dentist/dental assistant). Significantly higher infection rates (p <0.001) were observed among HCWs working in the clinic equipped with the VS900 aspirating vacuum pump without HEPA filters, while the lowest infection rate was found among HCWs working in the clinic using the V6000 aspirating system in dry mode. Conclusions HCWs working in the clinic equipped with an aspirating system which has HEPA filters and released the air into an external environment (V6000) exhibited significantly lower seroprevalence rates compared to HCWs in the clinic using an aspirating system without HEPA filters which released air within the dental operatory away from the operation site (VS900).","output":"Do aspirating systems have a role in preventing COVID-19 transmission among dental healthcare workers?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shipyard welders are often exposed to welding metal fumes.

To this end, we adopted a hybrid methodology based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and a Likert scale survey. The first method allows to us rank the e-commerce performance of different European countries, while the second one looks at the problems and barriers that characterize online shopping. The results of the study show that European countries have different sensitivities to the issue of cyber-security, and among them it is possible to identify three groups with different levels of attention to the critical issues of e-commerce. The Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark belong to the group of countries most responsive to e-commerce.

The incidence of other significant hospital-acquired bacterial infections (OHAI) was compared to previous years. Results: 58 HA-COVID-19 (7.1%) cases were identified. As compared to community-acquired cases, significant differences were observed in age (p=0.018), ethnicity (p<0.001) and comorbidity burden (p<0.001) but not in 30d mortality. CTNS negative predictive value was 60.3%. DRP was associated with greater mortality (p=0.034) and 34.5% HA-COVID-19 cases could be traced to delayed diagnosis in CA-COVID-19. Incidence of HA-COVID-19 correlated positively with DRP (R=0.7108) and staff sickness absence (R=0.7815). OHAI rates were similar to previous 2 years. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and isolation of COVID-19 would help reduce transmission. A single CTNS has limited value in segregating patients into positive and negative pathways.","output":"Incidence and outcomes of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections: significance of delayed diagnosis and correlation with staff absence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic sclerosis is a connective tissue disease with cutaneous involvement.

Vaccination is one of the most important and efficient ways to protect against the COVID-19 virus. In a review of the literature on parents decisions to vaccinate their children, we found that widespread vaccination was hampered by vaccine hesitancy, especially for children who play an important role in the coronavirus transmission in both family and school. To analyze parent vaccination decision-making for children, our review of the literature on parent attitudes to vaccinating children, identified the objective and subjective influencing factors in their vaccination decision. We found that the median rate of parents vaccinating their children against COVID-19 was 59.3% (IQR 48.60~73.90%). The factors influencing parents attitudes towards child vaccination were heterogeneous, reflecting country-specific factors, but also displaying some similar trends across countries, such as the education level of parents. The leading reason in the child vaccination decision was to protect children, family and others; and the fear of side effects and safety was the most important reason in not vaccinating children. Our study informs government and health officials about appropriate vaccination policies and measures to improve the vaccination rate of children and makes specific recommendations on enhancing child vaccinate rates.","output":"Parents Decisions to Vaccinate Children against COVID-19: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has progressed, increasing attention has focused on establishing natural and vaccine-induced immunity against this coronavirus and the disease, COVID-19, that it causes.

The selected FinTechs are M-PESA in Kenya, Nubank in Brazil, GCASH in the Philippines, and Easypaisa in Pakistan, which revolutionized the financial sector in their respective countries. However, a comparative study of their impact on financial inclusion in their respective country has not been conducted yet;therefore, the lessons obtained are helpful for the Peruvian situation due to their practical implications and because they raise possible areas for further and deeper research. The approach of this study considered a qualitative and quantitative method (to find a Pearson correlation between the percentage of the population of Country (A) that are users of FinTech (a) and the six selected demand-side indicators per country retrieved from the Global Findex Database) analysis to understand the results obtained. The results obtained indicate that M-PESA and GCASH, companies specialized in providing basic mobile money transactions such as remittances and withdrawals, did not impact the provision of other financial services such as savings or credit cards. In Easypaisas case, this company positively impacts the studied indicators, probably due to its original partnership with a microfinance institution. Regarding Nubank, despite its remarkable growth in the last years, the company does not affect financial inclusion in Brazil yet.

COVID-19 patients may display a cytokine release syndrome, which causes severe lung inflammation, leading, in many instances, to death. OBJECTIVE: This paper is intended to explore the possibilities of controlling the COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation by using licensed drugs with anti-inflammatory effects. HYPOTHESIS: We have previously described that pentoxifylline alone, or in combination with oxypurinol, reduces the systemic inflammation caused by experimentally-induced pancreatitis in rats. Pentoxifylline is an inhibitor of TNF-&#945; production and oxypurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase. TNF-&#945;, in turn, activates other inflammatory genes such as Nos2, Icam or IL-6, which regulate migration and infiltration of neutrophils into the pulmonary interstitial tissue, causing injury to the lung parenchyma. In acute pancreatitis, the anti-inflammatory action of pentoxifylline seems to be mediated by the prevention of the rapid and presumably transient loss of PP2A activity. This may also occur in the hyperinflammatory -cytokine releasing phase- of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with pentoxifylline, alone or in combination with oxypurinol, would prevent the potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSION: Pentoxifylline and oxypurinol are licensed drugs used for diseases other than COVID-19 and, therefore, phase I clinical trials would not be necessary for the administration to SARS-CoV-2- infected people. It would be worth investigating their potential effects against the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Pentoxifylline and Oxypurinol: Potential Drugs to Prevent the \\"Cytokine Release (Storm) Syndrome\\" Caused by SARS-CoV-2?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A review introducing the \\"In Focus\\" series of the journal ACS Central Science and its inaugural article, \\"Research and Development on Therapeutic Agents and Vaccines for COVID-19 and Related Human Coronavirus Diseases\\" by C Liu et al (2020)","output":"Introducing \\"In Focus\\", Community Resources Accelerating Science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To the Editor, We read the original study by De Michele et al. titled \\"Post severe COVID-19 infection lung damages study.

We present a case of a patient with PACS manifested as pulmonary fibrosis, carbon dioxide retention and difficulty weaning from BIPAP that experienced dramatic improvement following treatment with Acetazolamide. CASE PRESENTATION: 66-year-old female presented for 7 days of worsening cough and shortness of breath. She was found to be hypoxic on presentation with COVID-19 test resulting positive and was admitted. Her hospital course was complicated by rapid increase in oxygen requirements with the initiation of BIPAP on hospital day 19. At this time, arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis with pH 7.41, CO2 77 and HCO3 of 43. She was continued on BIPAP for several days before being weaned to high flow nasal cannula. On hospital day 44 she was noted to be increasingly lethargic. ABG obtained at this time showed pH of 7.3, CO2 >110 and HCO3 of 68. She was placed back on BIPAP and serial ABGs were monitored. At about 12 hours after the initiation of BIPAP, she developed a post-hypercapnic alkalosis with ABG demonstrating pH 7.46, CO2 90 and HCO3 50. At this time, BIPAP was stopped and Acetazolamide was administered at 500mg IV daily for 2 days.The patient experienced significant improvement in her mental status and work of breathing. She was weaned to nasal cannula. An ABG obtained the day following the second acetazolamide dose showed improvement in both metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis with pH 7.42, CO2 62 and HCO3 34. DISCUSSION: The role of correcting metabolic alkalosis in hypercapnic respiratory failure has been described over the years. Trials conducted have utilized the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor Acetazolamide to promote renal bicarbonate excretion with goal statistical endpoints of early liberation from mechanical ventilation, reduced hospital stay or mortality but have generally failed to demonstrate statistically significant benefit.In the DIABOLO trial, mechanically ventilated COPD patients with metabolic alkalosis were assigned to either Acetazolamide infusion or placebo. The study concluded without statistically significant benefit in the primary outcome (duration of mechanical ventilation) or important secondary outcomes such as ICU mortality or ICU length of stay. However, the average serum bicarbonate level was only 27 between the two groups. This leads to the question if acetazolamide may have benefits in specific patients with a more severe alkalosis in the right clinical context as shown in this case study. CONCLUSIONS: Alkalosis may surpass compensation and perpetuate hypercapnic respiratory failure. This may be especially common ARDS patients managed with a fluid restricted approach. Administration of acetazolamide may benefit appropriately selected patients. REFERENCE #1: Nalbandian A, Sehgal K, Gupta A, et al. Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Nat Med.

A comorbidity score could help in clinical stratification of patients admitted to internal medicine units. Our aim was to assess a novel modified Elixhauser index (mEi) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for predicting in-hospital mortality (IHM) in internal medicine patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS This single-center retrospective study enrolled all consecutive patients discharged from internal medicine unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both the mEi and CCI were easily calculated from administrative data. Comorbidity scores were tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the respective area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS The total sample consisted of 151 individuals, and 30 (19.9%) died during their hospital stay. Deceased subjects were older (82.810.8 vs. 63.318.1 years; p<0.001) and had a higher burden of comorbidities: the mEi and CCI were 29.911 vs. 8.89.2 and 4.62.6 vs. 1.22 (p<0.001), respectively. Only the mEi was independently associated with IHM (OR 1.173), and ROC curves analysis showed that the AUCs were 0.863 and 0.918 for the CCI and for mEi, respectively.

Material and methods: The data was collected from covid19india.org to perform analysis based on age and gender distribution. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the relation between confirmed and recovered cases while SIR epidemic model was used to determine the course of the pandemic in the country and the changes that have occurred from the first to the second wave. Results and discussions: Results show infectivity rate to be higher in ages 20-50 while mortality is higher in 50-80 age group while 60-70% of the infected population are males. Each of the 9 states have their own salient feature curves of infection. It was seen that the confirmed and recovered cases are more correlated at present than previous wave. The curves for both waves show a polynomial distribution while the reproduction number data shows an almost U-shaped curve indicating decrease of infection spread in the middle phase when the first wave was on a decline before picking up again owing to the second wave. Interpretations and conclusion: The gender and age distribution shows that although lower age group is more infected, mortality is high for higher age groups, on the other hand males are more prone to the infection.

We examined the effectiveness of an education-only (EO) versus education plus sleeve compression/exercise intervention (lymphedema education and prevention [LEAP]) on lymphedema incidence and range of motion (ROM) in a group-randomized trial across 38 cooperative group sites. METHODS: The treating institution was randomly assigned to either EO or LEAP by a study statistician. All patients at a treating institution participated in the same intervention (EO or LEAP) to minimize contamination bias. Participants completed surveys, arm volume measurements, and self-reported ROM assessments before surgery and at 12 and 18 months after surgery. Lymphedema was defined as a &#8805;10% difference in limb volume at any time post-surgery up to 18 months after surgery or diagnosis by a health provider. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were used to compare lymphedema-free rates between groups, stratified by lymph node surgery type. Self-reported ROM differences were compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of 554 participants (56% LEAP) were included in the analyses. At 18 months, lymphedema-free rates were 58% (EO) versus 55% (LEAP) (P = .37). ROM for both arms was greater in LEAP versus EO at 12 months; by 18 months, most women reported full ROM, regardless of group. In LEAP, only one-third wore a sleeve &#8805;75% of the time; 50% performed lymphedema exercises at least weekly. CONCLUSION: Lymphedema incidence did not differ by intervention group at 18 months. Poor adherence in the LEAP group may have contributed. However, physical therapy may speed recovery of ROM.

In cheetahs, 2 alleles exist for a single guanine nucleotide deletion in the putative NF-B binding site. In this study, a novel genotyping assay was developed to screen for the alleles.

However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of the SAA1A(?97delG) allele between individuals confirmed AA amyloidosis positive versus AA amyloidosis negative at the time of necropsy (n = 48). Thus, even though there is evidence that having more copies of the SAA1A(?97delG) allele results in a potentially protective decrease in serum concentrations of SAA protein in captive cheetahs, genotype is not associated with this disease within the North American population.

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Sakarya University Education and Training Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, between April 1 and 30, 2020. METHODOLOGY The study included 55 patients who were admitted with diagnosis of COVID-19, and whose illnesses showed a critical course that leads to AKI. The variables were studied as per objective. RESULTS During the follow-up, 43 out of 55 patients (78.2%) died and 12 (21.8%) were discharged with recovery. The mortality was higher in patients at stage 3 (88.9% mortality) compared to stage 2 (53.8% mortality) (p=0.014). In the nonsurvivor group, RDW (red cell distribution width) and albumin levels were lower at admission; whereas, the LDH levels and CRP/albumin ratios were higher. On regression analysis, low albumin level (OR: 12.793, p = 0.010), high LDH level (OR: 8.454, p = 0.026), and presence of stage 3 AKI (OR: 10.268, p = 0.020) were found as independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, who developed AKI. CONCLUSION In critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who developed AKI, it was seen that the presence of low albumin, high LDH, and stage 3 AKI at the time of admission could be used as predictors of mortality.

During the West African outbreak (2013C2016), several patients were treated with different types of anti-viral therapies including monoclonal antibody-based cocktails that had the potential to neutralise Ebola virus (EBOV). However, at the time, the efficacy of these therapies was uncertain. Given the scale of the outbreak, several clinical phenotypes came to the forefront including the ability of the same virus to cause recrudescence in the same patientperhaps through persisting in immune privileged sites. Several key questions remained including establishing if monoclonal antibody therapy was effective in humans with severe EVD, whether virus escape mutants were selected during treatment, and what is the potential mechanism(s) of persistence. This was made possible through longitudinal samples taken from a UK patient with EVD. METHODS: Several different sample types, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, were collected and sequenced using Illumina-based RNAseq. Sequence reads were mapped both to EBOV and the human genome and differential gene expression analysis used to identify changes in the abundance of gene transcripts as infection progressed. Digital Cell Quantitation analysis was used to predict the immune phenotype in samples derived from blood. RESULTS: The findings were compared to equivalent data from West African patients. The study found that both virus and host markers were predictive of a fatal outcome. This suggested that the extensive supportive care, and most likely the application of the medical countermeasure ZMab (a monoclonal antibody cocktail), contributed to survival of the UK patient. The switch from progression to a fatal outcome to a survival outcome could be seen in both the viral and host markers. The UK patient also suffered a recrudescence infection 10 months after the initial infection. Analysis of the sequencing data indicated that the virus entered a period of reduced or minimal replication, rather than other potential mechanisms of persistencesuch as defective interfering genomes. CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that comprehensive supportive care and the application of medical countermeasures are worth pursuing despite an initial unfavourable prognosis.","output":"Analysis of an Ebola virus disease survivor whose host and viral markers were predictive of death indicates the effectiveness of medical countermeasures and supportive care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to recognize SARSCCoV-2 infection have focused on respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath Although it is also well known that SARSCCoV-2 infection can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, there are emerging reports of SARSCCoV-2 infection causing surgical pathology We present the first case report of SARSCCoV-2 infection directly causing acute appendicitis, first suspected due to highly atypical histological features and later confirmed as polymerase chain reaction positive appendicular tissue sample","output":"SARSCCoV-2 isolation from an appendix"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in development of quantum computing processors brought ample opportunities to test the performance of various quantum algorithms with practical implementations.

We implemented the algorithm on IBM quantum processors with two different topological layouts - a fully connected triangle processor and a partially connected line processor. It turns out that the incomplete connectivity of the line processor affects the performance only minimally. On the other hand, it turns out that the transpilation, i.e. compilation of the circuit into gates physically available to the quantum processor, crucially influences the result.

Overproduction of IFN underlies several, potentially fatal, hyperinflammatory or immune-mediated diseases. Several data from animal models and/or from translational research in patients point to a role of IFN in hyperinflammatory diseases, such as primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, various forms of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including macrophage activation syndrome, and cytokine release syndrome, all of which are often managed by rheumatologists or in consultation with rheumatologists. Given the effects of IFN on B cells and T follicular helper cells, a role for IFN in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis is emerging. To improve our understanding of the role of IFN in human disease, IFN-related biomarkers that are relevant for the management of hyperinflammatory diseases are progressively being identified and studied, especially because circulating levels of IFN do not always reflect its overproduction in tissue. These biomarkers include STAT1 (specifically the phosphorylated form), neopterin and the chemokine CXCL9.

OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we describe the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19-related pneumothorax. METHODS: Studies were identified through MEDLINE, Pubmed, and Google Scholar databases using keywords of \\"COVID-19,\\" \\"SARS-CoV-2,\\" \\"pneumothorax,\\" \\"pneumomediastinum,\\" and \\"barotrauma\\" from January 1st, 2020 to January 30th, 2021. RESULTS: Among the nine observational studies, the incidence of pneumothorax is low at 0.3% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, the incidence of pneumothorax increases to 12.8-23.8% in those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with a high mortality rate up to 100%. COVID-19-related pneumothorax tends to be unilateral and right-sided. Age, pre-existing lung diseases, and active smoking status are not shown to be risk factors. The time to pneumothorax diagnosis is around 9.0-19.6 days from admission and 5.4 days after IMV initiation. COVID-19-related pneumothoraces are associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased likelihood of ICU admission and death, especially among the elderly. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related pneumothorax likely signify greater disease severity. With the high variability of COVID-19-related pneumothorax incidence described, a well-designed study is required to better assess the significance of COVID-19-related pneumothorax.","output":"The incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of pneumothorax in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remarkable improvements have been made in blood safety since the onset of the HIV epidemic.

A growing number of studies have reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We performed a systematic review of GI symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as of the serum levels of biomarkers related to liver function and lesion in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. METHODS: We surveyed relevant articles published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese up to July, 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, and BVS databases. Moreover, we surveyed potentially important articles in journals such as the NEJM, JAMA, BMJ, Gut, and AJG. RESULTS: This systematic review included 43 studies, including 18,246 patients. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom, affecting 11.5% of the patients, followed by nausea and vomiting (6.3%) and abdominal pain (2.3%). With regard to clinical severity, 17.5% of the patients were classified as severely ill, whereas 9.8% of them were considered to have a non-severe disease. Some studies showed increased aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase levels in a portion of the 209 analyzed patients and two studies.

This strategy has been well demonstrated in the surveillance and control of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) epidemics. This study aims to leverage contact tracing data to investigate the degree of spread and the formation of transmission cascades composing of multiple clusters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An algorithm on mining relationships between clusters for network analysis is proposed with 3 steps: horizontal edge creation, vertical edge consolidation, and graph reduction. The constructed network was then analyzed with information diffusion metrics and exponential-family random graph modeling. With categorization of clusters by exposure setting, the metrics were compared among cascades to identify associations between exposure settings and their network positions within the cascade using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Experimental results illustrated that transmission cascades containing or seeded by daily activity clusters spread faster while those containing social activity clusters propagated farther. Cascades involving work or study environments consisted of more clusters, which had a higher transmission range and scale. Social activity clusters were more likely to be connected, whereas both residence and healthcare clusters did not preferentially link to clusters belonging to the same exposure setting.

METHODS: Forty-two adolescents (15.3  1.3 years) were recruited (21 with healthy-weight/21 with overweight). Using a smartphone-assisted wearable electromyographic device, the chewing features of each participant were assessed over one evening, including the evening meal, in their natural home setting. RESULTS: The mean (SD) for chewing pace was 1.53  0.22 Hz, chewing power 30.1%  4.8%, number of chewing episodes 63.1  36.7 and chewing time 11.0  7.7 minutes.

Results: We identified significant ADME gene variation in African populations using data from 458 high-coverage whole genome sequences, 412 of which are novel, and from previously available African sequences from the 1,000 Genomes Project. ADME variation was not uniform across African populations, particularly within high impact coding variation. Copy number variation was detected in 116 ADME genes, with equal ratios of duplications/deletions. We identified 930 potential high impact coding variants, of which most are discrete to a single African population cluster. Large frequency differences (i.e., >10%) were seen in common high impact variants between clusters. Several novel variants are predicted to have a significant impact on protein structure, but additional functional work is needed to confirm the outcome of these for PGx use. Most variants of known clinical outcome are rare in Africa compared to European populations, potentially reflecting a clinical PGx research bias to European populations. Discussion: The genetic diversity of ADME genes across sub-Saharan African populations is large. The Southern African population cluster is most distinct from that of far West Africa. PGx strategies based on European variants will be of limited use in African populations. Although established variants are important, PGx must take into account the full range of African variation.

To characterize the coughed viral aerosol, the sampler needs to sample at higher flow rate and possess high physical collection efficiency as well as high viral preservation. However, most current inertia-based high flow bioaerosol samplers are not suited for viral aerosol sampling since the viability will be lost doing the sampling process. Current condensation growth methods only have good physical collection efficiency and viral preservation at low flow rate (< 10 LPM). In this study, we developed a viral aerosol sampling system using a cooler and steam-jet aerosol collector (SJAC) for bioaerosol collection for the first time. The system is based on mixing condensation growth method and has high viral preservation at a higher flow rate (12.5 LPM). We control the inlet aerosol flow temperature and the SJAC mixing reservoir temperature to improve the physical collection efficiency and viability preservation of the viral aerosol. Results indicate that the physical collection efficiency is 70C99% for aerosol 30C100 nm when the aerosol flow and mixing reservoir temperature was 19 and 50 C, respectively. In addition, the system was 7 and 22 times more efficient for viability preservation of MS2 bacteriophage than the commonly used All Glass Impinger 30 (AGI-30) and BioSampler?, respectively. Finally, the system can be applied to sample at a lower concentration (10(5) PFU/m(3)), and results shows the system was 4.7 times more efficient for viability preservation than using AGI-30 alone. The developed viral collection system will improve our understanding of the characteristics of coughed aerosol and can be used for future evaluation of respiratory protective equipment and environmental sampling.","output":"Development of an efficient viral aerosol collector for higher sampling flow rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oncology is the frontline of drug development. The current pharmaceutical pipeline is disproportional focused on oncology, where about 1/3 of all phases of development is in this therapeutic area.

Neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, thus it is important to recognize and diagnose the disease entity and treat early. When neuropsychiatric symptoms are involved, typically there are many other systemic features to aid in the diagnosis of SLE. Many autoantibodies have been discovered and are used to help diagnose SLE. The antibody present in most cases of pediatric SLE, as well as in many other rheumatic diseases, is the nonspecific antinuclear antibody (ANA). The ANA is a commonly used screening tool by primary care physicians when evaluating a patient with a possible rheumatic disorder. However, a small subset of SLE patients, 1C5%, present with a negative ANA, and it is important to keep SLE on the differential diagnosis in specific instances when a thorough infectious, metabolic and neurological workup has been completed and proven to be inconclusive. CASE PRESENTATION: This case involves a Hispanic adolescent female with a negative ANA who presented with diffuse cerebral edema secondary to leukoencephalopathy due to SLE with central nervous system involvement. She was normotensive on presentation and relatively symptom free aside from headache. She had an extensive workup while inpatient involving metabolic, infectious disease, rheumatology, and neurology prior to obtaining the diagnosis of SLE. She was treated with cyclophosphamide and rituximab with appropriate disease response. CONCLUSIONS: A review of the literature revealed 12 cases with SLE presenting with or developing diffuse cerebral edema and/or leukoencephalopathy. Our patients case differs in that she was also ANA negative despite other autoantibody positivity. While she did have low complements and transient leukopenia, she did not present with other signs of organ involvement, which made the diagnosis of SLE with neuropsychiatric involvement quite challenging. We discuss the importance of keeping SLE on the differential diagnosis despite a negative ANA in complex cases after thorough workup has been unrevealing, and to consider initial screening with not only the ANA but also dsDNA and complements to avoid missed diagnoses.","output":"Leukoencephalopathy and cerebral edema as the presenting manifestations of SLE in an ANA-negative adolescent female: a case report and review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: Spain was at the epicenter of the pandemic. Health centers across Spanish territory were not able to respond to non-emergency enquiries, leaving community pharmacies as the first point of patient's contact. Aims: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental and physical health of community pharmacy teams across Spain. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was performed with community pharmacy professionals throughout Spain. A questionnaire designed by our collaborator from the United Kingdom was adapted to the Spanish population and launched between October 2020 and February 2021. Results: A total of 98 participants responded to the questionnaire. The survey showed an 80% increase in workload. The pandemic had negatively impacted the well-being of community pharmacy professionals. The survey indicated a national shortage of medicines and personal protective equipment across Spain, particularly during the first peak. To adapt to this pandora's box of COVID-19, 96% of the pharmacies changed their settings to improve patients and staff's safety. Most of these changes were self-financed by the pharmacy owner. The pharmacists kept up to date with information released from the pharmacists' college, General Pharmaceutical Council and the Spanish Society of Community Pharmacists. The Public domain purchased more (79%) immune booster supplements.

There are different techniques involved in the drug development process which include random screening, computational approach, molecular manipulation and serendipitous research. Among these methods, the computational approach is considered as an efficient strategy to accelerate and economize the drug discovery process. OBJECTIVE This approach is mainly applied in various phases of drug discovery process including target identification, target validation, lead identification and lead optimization. Due to increase in the availability of information regarding various biological targets of different disease states, computational approaches such as molecular docking, de novo design, molecular similarity calculation, virtual screening, pharmacophore-based modeling and pharmacophore mapping have been applied extensively. METHODS Various drug molecules can be designed by applying computational tools to explore the drug candidates for treatment of Coronavirus infection. The world health organization has announced the novel corona virus disease as COVID-19 and declared it as pandemic globally on 11 February 2020. So, it is thought of interest to scientific community to apply computational methods to design and optimize the pharmacological properties of various clinically available and FDA approved drugs such as remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir, oseltamivir, ritonavir, arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, carfilzomib, baraticinib, prulifloxacin, etc for effective treatment of COVID-19 infection.

This study was conducted to guide the Qatari national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. The study investigated the time course of the epidemic, forecasted healthcare needs, predicted the impact of social and physical distancing restrictions, and rationalized and justified easing of restrictions. Methods: An age-structured deterministic model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and disease progression throughout the population. Results: The enforced social and physical distancing interventions flattened the epidemic curve, reducing the peaks for incidence, prevalence, acute-care hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations by 87%, 86%, 76%, and 78%, respectively. The daily number of new infections was predicted to peak at 12,750 on May 23, and active-infection prevalence was predicted to peak at 3.2% on May 25. Daily acute-care and ICU-care hospital admissions and occupancy were forecast accurately and precisely. By October 15, 2020, the basic reproduction number R0 had varied between 1.07-2.78, and 50.8% of the population were estimated to have been infected (1.43 million infections). The proportion of actual infections diagnosed was estimated at 11.6%. Applying the concept of Rt tuning, gradual easing of restrictions was rationalized and justified to start on June 15, 2020, when Rt declined to 0.7, to buffer the increased interpersonal contact with easing of restrictions and to minimize the risk of a second wave. No second wave has materialized as of October 15, 2020, five months after the epidemic peak.

Gelatin-polysuccinat (GP) recently regained attention despite a still unclear risk profile and widely unknown effects on cerebral and peripheral microcirculation. This study investigates the effects of GP versus balanced electrolyte solution (BEL) with focus on cerebral regional oxygen saturation and peripheral microcirculation in a porcine haemorrhagic shock model. METHODS After Animal Care Committee approval haemorrhagic shock was induced by arterial blood withdrawal in 27 anaesthetized pigs. Consequently, the animals received rapid fluid resuscitation by either GP or BEL to replace the removed amount of blood, or remained untreated (n = 3  9). Over two hours cerebral regional oxygen saturation by near-infrared spectroscopy and peripheral buccal microcirculation by combined white-light spectrometry and laser-Doppler flowmetry were recorded. Secondary parameters included extended haemodynamics, spirometry, haematological and blood gas parameters. RESULTS Both fluid resuscitation regimes sufficiently stabilized the macro- and microcirculation in haemorrhagic shock with a more pronounced effect following GP infusion. GP administration led to a persisting, critical impairment of cerebral regional oxygen saturation through considerable haemodilution. Survival rates were 100% in both fluid resuscitation groups, but only 33% in the untreated control. CONCLUSION Equal amounts of GP and BEL sufficiently stabilize systemic circulation and microcirculatory perfusion. Forced fluid resuscitation by GP should be applied with caution to prevent haemodilution-induced impairment of cerebral oxygen delivery.","output":"Effect of gelatin-polysuccinat on cerebral oxygenation and microcirculation in a porcine haemorrhagic shock model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has recently led to worldwide research efforts to identify subjects at greater risk of developing more severe illness: overall obesity displayed a strong correlation with critical illness and major severity of COVID-19 manifestations.

Indeed, 57% of all new cancer cases around the world occur in low income countries exacerbated by lack of awareness, lack of preventive strategies, and increased life expectancies. Despite recent efforts devoted to cancer epidemiology, statistics on cancer rates in Africa are often dispersed across different registries. In this study our goal included identifying the most promising prevention and treatment approaches available in Africa. To do this, we collated and analyzed the incidence and fatality rates for the 10 most common and fatal cancers in 56 African countries grouped into 5 different regions (North, West, East, Central and South) over 16-years (2002C2018). We examined temporal and regional trends by investigating the most important risk factors associated to each cancer type. Data were analyzed by cancer type, African region, gender, measures of socioeconomic status and the availability of medical devices. RESULTS: We observed that Northern and Southern Africa were most similar in their cancer incidences and fatality rates compared to other African regions. The most prevalent cancers are breast, bladder and liver cancers in Northern Africa; prostate, lung and colorectal cancers in Southern Africa; and esophageal and cervical cancer in East Africa. In Southern Africa, fatality rates from prostate cancer and cervical cancer have increased. In addition, these three cancers are less fatal in Northern and Southern Africa compared to other regions, which correlates with the Human Development Index and the availability of medical devices. With the exception of thyroid cancer, all other cancers have higher incidences in males than females. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the African continent suffers from a shortage of medical equipment, research resources and epidemiological expertise. While recognizing that risk factors are interconnected, we focused on risk factors more or less specific to each cancer type. This helps identify specific preventive and therapeutic options in Africa. We see a need for implementing more accurate preventive strategies to tackle this disease as many cases are likely preventable. Opportunities exist for vaccination programs for cervical and liver cancer, genetic testing and use of new targeted therapies for breast and prostate cancer, and positive changes in lifestyle for lung, colorectal and bladder cancers.

The high volume of media coverage played an important role in calling for improved public health services for the older population. Nevertheless, problematic media representations of older people might evoke or amplify ageism during the pandemic. Therefore, drawing on empirical data collected from five mainstream Chinese media outlets between January 3 and May 3, 2020, this study examined how the media constructed the vulnerability of older adults and its underlying ageist thinking during the pandemic. The findings showed that the media had clear preferences in constructing older people as passive recipients while seeking resources from families, public institutions and governments at various levels to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the media adopted a biomedical-centred framework presenting older people as a homogenous group that was vulnerable to the pandemic. In addition, we found that the media representations of older adults intensified the dichotomised relationship between the young and the old, causing the younger generations to perceive older people as a 'threat' to public health. Moving beyond the Chinese case, this article appeals to the media to be socially responsible by avoiding the stereotyping of the older population and uniting the whole society to combat COVID-19.

Our concluding remarks stress the importance of administering off-label and investigational drugs in the setting of clinical trials, or at least in standardized scenarios, to generate as much scientific knowledge as achievable while engaging in the best efforts to treat patients and save lives.","output":"Medicines for the Treatment Of COVID-19: Awaiting the Evidence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe pandemic of coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) continues to afflict the lives and livelihoods of many as global demand for vaccine supply remains unmet. MethodsPhase 1 of this trial (N=42) assessed the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of ascending levels of one-dose ARCT-021, a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine against Covid-19. Phase 2 (N=64) tested two-doses of ARCT-021 given 28 days apart. Both young and older adults were enrolled. The primary safety outcomes were local and systemic solicited adverse events (AEs) reported immediately and up to 7 days post-inoculation and unsolicited events reported up to 56 days after inoculation. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were antibody and T cell responses to vaccination, respectively. ResultsARCT-021 was well tolerated up to one 7.5 g dose and two 5.0 g doses. Local solicited AEs, namely injection-site pain and tenderness, as well as systemic solicited AEs, such as fatigue, headache and myalgia, were more common in ARCT-021 than placebo recipients, and in younger than older adults. Seroconversion rate for anti-S IgG was 100% in all cohorts except for the 1 g one-dose in younger adults and the 7.5 g one-dose in older adults, which were each 80%. Neutralizing antibody titers increased with increasing dose although the responses following 5.0 g and 7.5 g ARCT-021 were similar. Anti-S IgG titers overlapped with those in Covid-19 convalescent plasma. ARCT-021 also elicited T-cell responses against the S glycoprotein. ConclusionTaken collectively, the favorable safety and immunogenicity profiles support further clinical development of ARCT-021.","output":"A phase 1/2 randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled ascending dose trial to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of ARCT-021 in healthy adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Platform trial designs are used increasingly in cancer clinical research and are considered an efficient model for evaluating multiple compounds within a single disease or disease subtype. However, these trial designs can be challenging to operationalise. The use of platform trials in oncology clinical research has increased considerably in recent years as advances in molecular biology enable molecularly defined stratification of patient populations and targeted therapy evaluation. Whereas multiple separate trials may be deemed infeasible, platform designs allow efficient, parallel evaluation of multiple targeted therapies in relatively small biologically defined patient sub-populations with the promise of increased molecular screening efficiency and reduced time for drug evaluation. Whilst the theoretical efficiencies are widely reported, the operational challenges associated with these designs (complexity, cost, regulatory, resource) are not always well understood. MAIN: In this commentary, we describe our practical experience of the implementation and delivery of the UK plasmaMATCH trial, a platform trial in advanced breast cancer, comprising an integrated screening component and multiple parallel downstream mutation-directed therapeutic cohorts. plasmaMATCH reported its primary results within 3 years of opening to recruitment. We reflect on the operational challenges encountered and share lessons learnt to inform the successful conduct of future trials. Key to the success of the plasmaMATCH trial was well co-ordinated stakeholder engagement by an experienced clinical trials unit with expert methodology and trial management expertise, a federated model of clinical leadership, a well-written protocol integrating screening and treatment components and including justification for the chosen structure and intentions for future adaptions, and an integrated funding model with streamlined contractual arrangements across multiple partners. Findings based on our practical experience include the importance of early engagement with the regulators and consideration of a flexible resource infrastructure to allow adequate resource allocation to support concurrent trial activities as adaptions are implemented in parallel to the continued management of patient safety and data quality of the ongoing trial cohorts. CONCLUSION: Platform trial designs allow the efficient reporting of multiple treatment cohorts. Operational challenges can be overcome through multidisciplinary engagement, streamlined contracting processes, rationalised protocol and database design and appropriate resourcing.","output":"Operational complexity versus design efficiency: challenges of implementing a phase IIa multiple parallel cohort targeted treatment platform trial in advanced breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Philippines pediatric national immunization program (NIP) included the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine manufactured by Pfizer (PCV13-PFE) since 2015. Uptake has been slow in particular regions, with coverage only reaching all regions in 2019. Given affordability challenges in the context of higher coverage, this study seeks to determine whether universal coverage across all regions of the Philippines with PCV13-PFE will provide good value for money compared with 10-valent PCV alternatives manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (PCV10-GSK) or Serum Institute of India (PCV10-SII). METHODS: A decision analytic model is adapted for this cost-effectiveness analysis in the Philippines. Clinical and economic input parameters are taken from published sources. Future disease is predicted using age-stratified and population-level observed serotype dynamics. Total cases of pneumococcal disease, deaths, direct and indirect healthcare costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained are discounted 7% annually and modeled for each PCV. Given clinical uncertainty, PCV10-SII outcomes are reported as ranges. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are calculated for PCV13-PFE versus lower-valent PCVs (PCV10-GSK or PCV10-SII) from a societal perspective over 10 years. RESULTS: Nationwide PCV13-PFE use over 10 years is estimated to avert 375,831 more cases, save 53,189 additional lives, and gain 153,349 QALYs compared with PCV10-GSK. This equates to cost-savings of PHP 12.27 billion after vaccine costs are accounted for. Similarly, PCV13-PFE is more effective and cost-saving compared with PCV10-SII. Switching programs to PCV10-SII would result in more cases of disease (313,797 C 666,889), more deaths (22,759 C 72,435), and lost QALYs (108,061 C 266,108), equating to a net economic loss (PHP 359.82 million C 14.41 billion). PCV13-PFE remains cost-effective in the presence of parameter uncertainty. CONCLUSION: PCV13-PFE would prevent exceedingly more cases and deaths compared with lower-valent PCVs. Additionally, the PCV13-PFE program is estimated to continue providing cost-savings, offering the best value for money to achieve universal PCV coverage in the Philippines.","output":"Cost-Effectiveness of the 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13) Versus Lower-Valent Alternatives in Filipino Infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the world. About 70% of cervical cancers are caused by the most oncogenic HPV genotypes of 16 and 18. Since available prophylactic vaccines do not induce immunity in those with established HPV infections, the development of therapeutic HPV vaccines using E6 and E7 oncogenes, or both as the target antigens remains essential. Also, knocking out the E6 and E7 oncogenes in host genome by genome-editing CRISPR/Cas system can result in tumor growth suppression. These methods have shown promising results in both preclinical and clinical trials and can be used for controlling the progression of HPV-related cervical diseases. This comprehensive review will detail the current treatment of HPV-related cervical precancerous and cancerous diseases. We also reviewed the future direction of treatment including different kinds of therapeutic methods and vaccines, genome-editing CRISPR/Cas system being studied in clinical trials. Although the progress in the development of therapeutic HPV vaccine has been slow, encouraging results from recent trials showed vaccine-induced regression in high-grade CIN lesions. CRISPR/Cas genome-editing system is also a promising strategy for HPV cancer therapy.

We can estimate when sustained disease transmission will end in a population by calculating the population-specific basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] , the expected number of secondary cases generated by an infected person in the absence of any interventions. The value of [Formula: see text] relates to a herd immunity threshold (HIT), which is given by [Formula: see text]. When the immune fraction of a population exceeds this threshold, sustained disease transmission becomes exponentially unlikely (barring mutations allowing SARS-CoV-2 to escape immunity). Here, we report state-level [Formula: see text] estimates obtained using Bayesian inference. Maximum a posteriori estimates range from 7.1 for New Jersey to 2.3 for Wyoming, indicating that disease transmission varies considerably across states and that reaching herd immunity will be more difficult in some states than others. [Formula: see text] estimates were obtained from compartmental models via the next-generation matrix approach after each model was parameterized using regional daily confirmed case reports of COVID-19 from 21 January 2020 to 21 June 2020. Our [Formula: see text] estimates characterize the infectiousness of ancestral strains, but they can be used to determine HITs for a distinct, currently dominant circulating strain, such as SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta (lineage B.1.617.2), if the relative infectiousness of the strain can be ascertained.

Additionally, whether kidney outcomes have evolved during the course of the pandemic is unknown. Methods: We used electronic records to identify COVID-19 patients with and without AKI admitted to 3 New York Hospitals between March 2 and August 25, 2020. Outcomes included AKI overall and according to admission week, AKI stage, the requirement for new renal replacement therapy (RRT), mortality and recovery of kidney function. Logistic regression was utilized to assess associations of patient characteristics and outcomes. Results: Out of 4732 admissions 1386 (29.3%) patients had AKI. Among those with AKI, 717 (51.7%) had Stage 1, 132 (9.5%) Stage 2, 537 (38.7%) stage 3, and 237 (17.1%) required RRT initiation. In March 536/1648 (32.5%) of patients developed AKI compared with 15/87 (17.2%) in August (P<0.001 for monthly trend) whereas RRT initiation was required in 6.9% and 0% of admission, in March and August respectively. Mortality was higher with than without AKI (51.6% vs 8.6%) and was 71.9% in individuals requiring RRT. However, most patients with AKI who survived hospitalization (77%) recovered to within 0.3 mg/dL of baseline creatinine. Among those surviving to discharge, 62% discontinued RRT. Conclusions: AKI impacts a high proportion of admitted COVID-19 patients and is associated with high mortality, particularly when RRT is required.

This review explores the evidence surrounding the importance of being born in the right unit, the advantages of in utero transfers compared to ex utero transfers, and how to accurately assess which women are at most risk of delivering early and the challenges of in utero transfers. Accurate identification of the women most at risk of preterm birth is key to prioritising who to transfer antenatally, but the administrative burden and pathway variation of in utero transfer in the UK are likely to compromise optimal clinical care. Women reported the impact that in utero transfers have on them, including the emotional and financial burdens of being transferred and the anxiety surrounding domestic and logistical concerns related to being away from home. The final section of the review explores new approaches to reforming the in utero transfer process, including learning from outside the UK and changing policy and guidelines. Examples of collaborative regional guidance include the recent Pan-London guidance on in utero transfers. Reforming the transfer process can also be aided through technology, such as utilising the CotFinder app. In utero transfer is an unavoidable aspect of maternity and neonatal care, and the burden will increase if preterm birth rates continue to rise in association with increased rates of multiple pregnancy, advancing maternal age, assisted reproductive technologies, and obstetric interventions. As funding and capacity pressures on health services increase because of the COVID-19 pandemic, better prioritisation and sustained multi-disciplinary commitment are essential to maximise better outcomes for babies born too soon.","output":"All the right moves: why in utero transfer is both important for the baby and difficult to achieve and new strategies for change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate systematically the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrial.gov, CNKI, Wanfang Data, China Biomedical Literature Service System, and China Clinical Trial Registry were searched for randomized controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccines published up to December 31, 2020. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool was used to assess the quality of studies. A qualitative analysis was performed on the results of clinical trials. RESULTS Thirteen randomized, blinded, controlled trials, which involved the safety and efficacy of 11 COVID-19 vaccines, were included. In 10 studies, the 28-day seroconversion rate of subjects exceeded 80%. In two 10 000-scale clinical trials, the vaccines were effective in 95% and 70.4% of the subjects, respectively. The seroconversion rate was lower than 60% in only one study. In six studies, the proportion of subjects who had an adverse reaction within 28 days after vaccination was lower than 30%. This proportion was 30%-50% in two studies and > 50% in the other two studies. Most of the adverse reactions were mild to moderate and resolved within 24 hours after vaccination. The most common local adverse reaction was pain or tenderness at the injection site, and the most common systemic adverse reaction was fatigue, fever, or bodily pain. The immune response and incidence of adverse reactions to the vaccines were positively correlated with the dose given to the subjects. The immune response to the vaccines was worse in the elderly than in the younger population. In 6 studies that compared single-dose and double-dose vaccination, 4 studies showed that double-dose vaccination produced a stronger immune response than single-dose vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Most of the COVID-19 vaccines appear to be effective and safe. Double-dose vaccination is recommended. However, more research is needed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the vaccines and the influence of dose, age, and production process on the protective efficacy.","output":"Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAntibody titration and the life span of the antibody against SARS-CoV-2 have been found to be determined by the clinical presentation as well.

Thus, this study is an attempt in assessing the anti-SARs-COV-2 antibody in health care workers. MethodsThis laboratory-based cross-sectional study was performed in Manmohan Memorial Medical College and Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu from November 2020 to January 2021. A total of 185 HCWs were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in the blood serum specimens. A structured questionnaire was administered to collect information from HCWs. Anti-SARS- CoV-2 antibody screening was performed using a lateral flow immunoassay. Data were analyzed according to standard statistical methods using SPSS version 20. ResultsA total of 185 HCWs were participated in the study, among which 41 (22.2%) of them tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Among the 41 individuals who tested positive, 37 of them tested positive for IgG only and 4 of them tested positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies. Presence of history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.001), presence of flu-like symptoms within the last 6 months (p<0.001), and presence of positive contact history (p=0.002) were statistically significant with antibody screening among HCWs.

However, tropospheric O(3) concentrations spiked over many urban regions. Moreover, reductions in SO(2) and NO(x) (atmospheric cooling agents) emissions unmask heating exerted by warming forcers. Basing governmental guidelines, we model daily emissions reductions in CO(2) and short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) during different lockdown periods using bottom-up regional emission inventory. The transport sector, with maximum level of closure, followed by power plants and industry reduced nearly ?50% to ?75% emissions of CO(2), primary PM(2.5), SO(2) and NO(x), while warming SLCFs (black carbon, CH(4), CO and non-methane VOCs) showed insignificant reduction from continuing activity in residential and agricultural sectors. Consequently, the analysis indicates that reduction in the emission ratio of NO(x) to NMVOC coincided spatially with observed increases in O(3), consistent with reduced uptake of O(3) from night-time NO(x) reactions. Also, similar reductions, occurring for longer timescales (say, a year), can potentially increase the annual warming rate over India from the positive regional temperature response, estimated using climate metric. Further, by linking ongoing policies to sectoral reductions during lockdown, this study shows that the relative pacing of implementation among policies is crucial to avoid counter-productive results. A key policy recommendation is introduction and improving efficacy of programs targeting reduction of NMVOC and warming SLCF emissions (shifts away from biomass cooking technologies, household electrification and curbing open burning of crop residues), must precede the strengthening of policies targeting NO(x) and SO(2) dominated sectors.","output":"COVID-19 lockdown closures of emissions sources in India: Lessons for air quality and climate policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The New Coronavirus Epidemic (2019-nCoV), discovered in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019, presents mainly with pulmonary pneumonia that is preceded by fever, cough and myalgia.

To lay the groundwork for ethical discussion, I explain the basics of beta thalassemia biochemistry and screening and the clinical picture of beta thalassemia major. I then elaborate on a specific example of the challenges of beta thalassemia major in Cyprus before moving on to the case of Vietnam and discuss the improbability of treatment for this disorder in Vietnam and therefore, the extensive suffering that it causes the Vietnamese people. This leads to my argument that a beta thalassemia screening in Vietnam would hold up the ethical principle of nonmaleficence and also preserves and enhances reproductive choice. I then propose that Vietnam's successful COVID-19 response can be used as a roadmap for beta thalassemia screening.","output":"The ethics of genetic screening for beta thalassemia in Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM The Covid-19 epidemic has severely strained health care systems across the globe. The impacts are multiple especially for patients cared for cancer. The Covid-19 epidemic has several impacts on the management of lung cancer patients. The aim of this work was to summarize the available epidemiological data on patients diagnosed with lung cancer infected with Covid-19 and describe the different strategies to improve the management of these patients by summarizing the recommendations in this area. PATIENTS AND METHODS The Teravolt cohort is an observational multicenter registry, including patients with non-small cell cancer, small cell cancer or mesothelioma but also epithelial tumors and a diagnosis of Covid-19. The Theravolt registry indicates an unexpectedly high mortality rate in patients with thoracic malignancies with COVID-19. RESULTS Between March 26 and April 12, 2020, 200 patients treated in 8 countries were included. They had a performance status (PS) of 0-1 in 72% of cases, were smokers or ex-smokers in 81% of cases, had non-small cell cancer (76% of cases), were under treatment in 74% of cases, and the majority were first-line cases (57%). The hospitalization rate was 76% and the mortality rate 33%; only 10% of patients with criteria for intensive care hospitalization were admitted to the intensive care. CONCLUSION Data presented in this registry suggest a high mortality in patients with thoracic cancer and Covid-19. Therofere, the importance to create a safe healthcare system during Covid-19 pandemic is underlined along with the need for essential effective clinical service delivery to patients with lung cancer.","output":"Lung Cancer, Covid-19 Infections and Chemotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding concerns for receiving COVID-19 vaccines is key to ensuring appropriately tailored health communications to increase vaccine uptake. However, limited data exists about vaccine concerns among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). METHODS: Data from the COVID-19 Effects on the Mental and Physical Health of AAPI Survey Study (COMPASS), a cross-sectional, national survey for AAPI adults in the U.S. were used (N=1,646). Descriptive statistics were used to assess sample characteristics including proportions of AAPI with various COVID-19 vaccine concerns, categorized as none, side-effects only, unsafe only, and multiple reasons, and differences in vaccine concerns by socio-demographics. Ordinary multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between a characteristic and having any vaccine concerns. RESULTS: Overall, 76% of the respondents reported having at 1 concerns about the vaccine. The most common concern was side effects (65%). Vietnamese Americans reported less concerns (vs. Chinese Americans). Those who were 30-39 and 40-49 years old (vs. <30), females (vs. males), and experienced mild negative impacts from COVID-19 on family income/employment (vs. no change) reported more concerns about the vaccine. Those who had less vaccine concerns were those who reported higher (vs. low) health status, 60 years old (vs. <30), and separated/divorced/widowed (vs. single). DISCUSSION: AAPI is a diverse population and this study revealed differences in vaccine concerns across AAPI groups. Findings revealed potential targets for patient education needs. Effective strategies to address various vaccine concerns across subgroups of AAPI will be crucial to ensure equity in vaccination uptake.","output":"Differences in COVID-19 Vaccine Concerns Among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: The COMPASS Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent emergence of SARS-Cov-2 has resulted in unprecedented spread of COVID-19 exhibiting wide variability in individuals symptoms. Despite rapid progress in characterizing the role of host genetics in SARS-Cov-2 infection, there is limited understanding of the role of host genetic variation and the molecular mechanisms including the knowledge of genes and pathways that contribute to COVID-19. Previous research to understand the mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19 outcomes have focused on lung- and brain-related pathologies. Here, we integrated a genome-wide association study of COVID-19 hospitalization (7,885 cases and 961,804 controls from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative) with mRNA expression, splicing, and protein levels (n = 18,502). We identified 27 genes related to inflammation and coagulation pathways whose genetically predicted expression was associated with COVID-19 hospitalization. These genes converge on cytokine-cytokine and the JAK-STAT signaling pathways. We functionally characterized the 27 genes using phenome- and laboratory-wide association scans in Vanderbilt Biobank (BioVU;n = 85,460) and identified coagulation-related clinical symptoms, immunologic, and blood-cell-related biomarkers. We replicated these findings in the African-American cohort here in BioVU and found concordant results.

METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 300 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy with breast reconstruction and PMRT at our institution from 2000 to 2017. Reconstruction types included autologous flaps (AR), single-stage-direct-to-implant and two-stages expander/implant (TE/I). The primary endpoint was the rate of reconstruction complications including infection, skin and fat necrosis. Subgroup analysis compared rates of capsular contracture, implant rupture, implant exposure and overall implant failure in single-stage-direct-to-implant to TE/I. The secondary endpoint was identifying the time interval between surgery with immediate implant-based reconstruction and PMRT associated with lower probability of implant failure. Logistic regression models, Kaplan-Meier estimates and Polynomial regression were used to assess endpoints. RESULTS The median follow-up was 43.5 months. 29.3%, 28.3% and 42.4% of the cohort had AR, TE/I and single-stage-direct-to-implant D, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence rate of complications was 14.0%, 29.7% and 19.4% for AR, TE/I and single-stage-direct-to-implant, respectively (Log rank p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed significant association between TE/I and higher risk of infection (OR 8.1, p = 0.009) compared to AR, while single-stage-direct-to-implant and AR were comparable (OR 3.2, p = 0.2). On subgroup analysis, TE/I was significantly associated with higher rates of implant failure. The mean wait time to deliver PMRT after immediate reconstruction with no adjuvant chemotherapy was 8.4 and 10.7 weeks in single-stage-direct-to-implant and TE/I, respectively (p < 0.005). Delivering PMRT after 8 weeks of surgery yielded 10% probability of reconstruction failure in single-stage-direct-to-implant versus 40% in TE/I. CONCLUSION In comparison to two stages reconstruction, single-stage-direct-to-implant following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has lower complications and offers timely delivery of PMRT.","output":"Optimal breast reconstruction type for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy followed by radiation therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in multiple waves of infection worldwide. The large variations in case fatality ratio among different geographical regions suggest that the human susceptibility against this virus varies substantially.

It was demonstrated that individuals with blood group O are at the lower risk of coronavirus infection. To establish the association of ABO blood group in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, we for the first time analysed SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies among 509 individuals, collected from three major districts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh region of India. Interestingly, we found neutralising antibodies in significantly higher percentage of people with blood group AB (0.36) followed by B (0.31), A (0.22) and lowest in people with blood group O (0.11). We further estimated that people with blood group AB are at comparatively higher risk of infection than other blood groups.

It is therefore important to identify both hazardous and protective individual factors during the pandemic. The current research exaplored the relationships between self-reported affective responding, perceived personal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and subjective well-being. An online survey (N = 471) conducted in Sweden between June and September, 2020, showed that higher levels of irritability, impulsivity, and the tendency to experience and express anger were generally associated with more severe personal consequences of the pandemic, particularly in areas related to family life, work/study, and finances. While more severe impacts of the pandemic in these areas of life were directly associated with lower subjective well-being, emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal appeared to moderate the extent to which consequences of the pandemic in other areas of life (i.e., social, free-time and physical activities) translated into decreased well-being. This suggests that cognitive reappraisal may serve to protect against some of the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Overall, the results indicate that the perceived consequences of the pandemic are multifaceted and that future research should examine these consequences using a multidimensional approach.","output":"Self-reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, affective responding, and subjective well-being - A Swedish survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a new non-parametric seasonal unit root testing framework that is robust to periodic non-stationary volatility in innovation variance by making an extension to the fractional seasonal variance ratio unit root tests of Ero?lu et al.

The setup allows for both periodic heteroskedasticity structure of Burridge and Taylar (J Econ 104(1):91C117, 2001) and non-stationary volatility structure of Cavaliere and Taylor (Econ Theory 24(1):43-71, 2008). We show that the limiting null distributions of the variance ratio tests depend on nuisance parameters derived from the underlying volatility process. Monte Carlo simulations show that the standard variance ratio tests can be substantially oversized in the presence of such effects. Consequently, we propose wild bootstrap implementations of the variance ratio tests. Wild bootstrap resampling schemes are shown to deliver asymptotically pivotal inference. The simulation evidence depicts that the proposed bootstrap tests perform well in practice and essentially correct the size problems observed in the standard fractional seasonal variance ratio tests, even under extreme patterns of heteroskedasticity.

We compared numbers and proportions of common and critical chief complaints and diagnoses, triage assessments, throughput, disposition, and selected hospital lengths of stay and out-of-hospital deaths. Results In the period of interest, emergency department visits decreased by nearly 50%. Total number of patients diagnosed with myocardial infarctions, stroke, appendicitis and cholecystitis decreased. The percentage of visits for mental health complaints increased. There was an increase in deaths, driven by out-of-hospital mortality. Conclusion Fewer patients presenting with acute and time-sensitive diagnoses suggests that patients are deferring care, this may be further supported by an increase in out of hospital mortality. Understanding which patients are deferring care and why will allow us to develop outreach strategies and ensure that those in need of rapid assessment and treatment will do so, preventing downstream morbidity and mortality.","output":"Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Emergency Department Presentations in an Integrated Health System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk perceptions and trusted sources of information may have influenced consumer food handling practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used a mixed-method qualitative-quantitative approach to assess consumer risk perception and trusted sources of food safety information during the pandemic. From April to August of 2020, five waves of online surveys (N = 3,584, with a minimum of 700 per month) were distributed to a U.S. consumer panel, which included only primary food preparers and grocery shoppers. The online focus groups recruited participants (N = 43) from the first wave of survey respondents and were conducted via Webex from May to July 2020. Topics covered in both studies focused on food safety risk perceptions and trusted sources of information during the pandemic. Trusted sources of information included government agencies, healthcare professionals, scientists, and social media. Throughout the longitudinal study, survey respondents and focus group participants perceived a higher risk of getting COVID-19 from people than from food. Survey respondents believed that handwashing could protect them more from COVID-19 than from foodborne illnesses. Many focus group participants practiced handwashing to prevent them from contracting COVID-19 from food items. Both survey respondents and focus group participants trusted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and healthcare professionals for COVID-19 and food safety information. Focus group participants trusted these entities because they provide information that is scientifically proven. Survey data for all five months reported social media to be the least-trusted source of both COVID-19 and food safety information. Focus group participants agreed that social media has misinformation. The findings suggest that increased risk perception may have caused consumers to adopt good hand hygiene. However, consumers may not be connecting such practices to food safety. Food safety educators can use this time of heightened risk perception to connect COVID-19 and food safety practices.

Whilst the diets of low-income households have been subject to scrutiny, there is limited evidence in the UK on the diet quality and food practices of households reporting food insecurity and food bank use. We explore lived experiences of food insecurity and underlying drivers of diet quality among low-income families, drawing upon two years of participatory research with families of primary school age children. Methods: We report on a mixed-methods study of the relationship between low income, food bank use, food practices and consumption from a survey of 612 participants, including 136 free text responses and four focus groups with 22 participants. The research followed a parallel mixed-methods design: qualitative and quantitative data were collected separately, although both were informed by participatory work. Quantitative data were analysed using binary and multinomial logistic regression modelling;qualitative data were analysed thematically. Results: Lower income households and those living with food insecurity struggle to afford a level of fruit and vegetable consumption that approaches public health guidance for maintaining a healthy diet, despite high awareness of the constituents of a healthy diet. Participants used multiple strategies to ensure as much fruit, vegetable and protein consumption as possible within financial constraints. The quantitative data suggested a relationship between higher processed food consumption and having used a food bank, independent of income and food security status. Conclusions: The findings suggest that individualised, behavioural accounts of food practices on a low-income misrepresent the reality for people living with poverty. Behavioural or educational interventions are therefore likely to be less effective in tackling food insecurity and poor nutrition among people on a low income;policies focusing on structural drivers, including poverty and geographical access to food, are needed.","output":"The reality is that on Universal Credit I cannot provide the recommended amount of fresh fruit and vegetables per day for my children: Moving from a behavioural to a systemic understanding of food practices: [version 1;peer review: 2 approved]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global justice theorists have widely discussed how the international intellectual property rights regime (i.e., the TRIPs regime of the World Trade Organization) makes it more difficult to achieve the goal of universal access to generic (and more affordable) vital COVID-19 treatments (including potential COVID-19 vaccines).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a serious game with the purpose of providing science-based information on the prevention of COVID-19 and personal care during the pandemic while assessing players knowledge about COVID-19Crelated topics. METHODS: The study was conducted with the interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists in health sciences, computing, and design at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The health recommendations were grouped into six thematic blocks, presented in a quiz format. The software languages were based on the progressive web app development methodology with the Ionic framework, JavaScript, HTML5, cascading style sheets, and TypeScript (Angular). Open data reports of how users interact with the serious game were obtained using the Google Analytics application programming interface. The visual identity, logo, infographics, and icons were carefully developed by considering a selection of colors, typography, sounds, and images that are suitable for young audiences. Cards with cartoon characters were introduced at the end of each thematic topic to interact with the player, reinforcing their correct answers or alerting them to the need to learn more about the disease. The players performance was assessed by the rate of incorrect and correct answers and analyzed by linear correlation coefficient over 7 weeks. The agile SCRUM development methodology enabled quick and daily interactions of developers through a webchat and sequential team meetings. RESULTS: The game COVID-19CDid You Know? was made available for free on a public university website on April 1, 2020. The game had been accessed 17,571 times as of September 2020.

SUMMARY ANSWER: SARS-CoV-2 infection does not affect fresh ART treatment outcomes, except for a possible long term negative effect on oocyte yield (>180 days post infection). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A single previous study suggested no evidence that a history of asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in females caused impairment of fresh ART treatment outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective cohort study, including all SARS-CoV-2 infected women who underwent fresh ART cycles within a year from infection (the first cycle post infection), between October 2020 and June 2021, matched to non-diagnosed controls. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Patients from two large IVF units in Israel who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and later underwent fresh ART cycles were matched by age to non-diagnosed, non-vaccinated controls. Demographics, cycle characteristics and cycle outcomes, including oocyte yield, maturation rate, fertilization rate, number of frozen embryos per cycle, and clinical pregnancy rates, were compared between groups. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: One hundred and twenty-one infected patients and 121 controls who underwent fresh ART cycles were included. Oocyte yield (12.50 versus 11.29; p = 0.169) and mature oocyte rate (78% versus 82%; p = 0.144) in all fresh cycles were similar between groups, as were fertilization rates, number of frozen embryos per cycle and clinical pregnancy rates (43% versus 40%; p = 0.737) in fresh cycles with an embryo transfer. In a logistic regression model, SARS-CoV-2 infection more than 180 days prior to retrieval had a negative effect on oocyte yield (p = 0.018, Slope=-4.08, 95% CI -7.41 C -0.75), although the sample size was small. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A retrospective study with data that was not uniformly generated under a study protocol, no antibody testing for the control group. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The study findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not affect treatment outcomes, including oocyte yield, fertilization and maturation rate, number of good quality embryos, and clinical pregnancy rates, in fresh ART cycles, except for a possible long term negative effect on oocyte yield when retrieval occurs > 180 days post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are warranted to support these findings. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None.

Methods : Demographics and clinical variables on admission, as well as medical and mechanical therapeutic interventions, were extracted from Electronic Clinical Records in 274 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients attending a third level hospital IRCU. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, variables that best discriminated mortality were obtained. Principal components analysis and a neural network (NN) algorithm were applied. Results : In relation to respiratory support, high-flow oxygen therapy and weaning procedures were associated with survival as were CPAP and non-invasive ventilation with low levels of support among the most severely affected. The IRCU achieved a survival rate of 87.6%, avoided 178 ICU admissions, successfully referred 35% to the ICU, and of these, 94% later survived the weaning phase. Higher mortality incidence was associated with cardiac and respiratory diseases and fever, heart rhythm and blood pressure disturbances. Following analysis of specific therapeutic options Corticoids and Anticoagulants were associated with better outcomes. Conclusions : The IRCU prevented the collapse of the ICU, allowed for recovered ICU patients to be quickly released from their unit, thus freeing up critical care beds and permitting them to function more effectively and in terms of mortality, achieved good results, that did not worsen due to a possible delay in intubation. In addition, we have generated an open-access NN capable of identifying severity predictors of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"The role of Intermediate Respiratory Care Units in preventing ICU collapse during the COVID pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Calls are emerging for oral health system reform under the Universal Healthcare (UHC) domain, while internationally there is an absence of political priority for oral health. In the Republic of Ireland there is very limited coverage of oral healthcare for the whole population. Smile agus Slinte Irelands oral health policy published in 2019, represents the first change to national policy in over 25 years. METHODS: This research examined the key factors influencing oral health policy, development, and implementation in Ireland during the period 1994C2021. A case study approach was adopted with two strands of data collection: documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with elite participants. Analysis was guided by Howletts five stream framework. RESULTS: Ireland shares the international experience of oral health having very low political priority. This has perpetuated unequal access to public dental services for children and special needs populations while austerity measures applied to adult schemes resulted in increased unmet need with no universal coverage for dental care. The only area where there is political interest in oral health is orthodontic care. This low political priority combined with a lack of actor power in national leadership positions in the Department of Health and Health Service Executive has contributed to successive non-implementation of oral health policy recommendations. This is most evident in the failure to publish the Draft National Oral Health Policy in 2009. The research finds a failure to adequately engage with key stakeholders, particularly the dental profession in the development of the 2019 policy. All these weaknesses have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Irelands new oral health policy, Smile agus Slinte, presents an opportunity for the provision of much needed public dental services. However, successful reform will require strong political will and collaboration with dental leadership to provide advocacy at national level. Global calls to incorporate oral health into the UHC agenda and an agreed political consensus for UHC in Ireland may provide an opportunity for change. Genuine engagement of all stakeholders to develop an implementation strategy is necessary to harness this potential window of opportunity for oral health system reform.","output":"'Toothlessthe absence of political priority for oral health: a case study of Ireland 1994C2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare personnel are often at high risk of contamination when participating in airway management and other aerosol-generating procedures. AIM: We explored the differences in self-contamination after removal of gown and coverall personal protective equipment (PPE) using an ultraviolet-fluorescent solution. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled crossover trial was set in a third-level university health centre in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during August-October 2020. The study included 60 anaesthesia personnel volunteers, and no participants were excluded from the study. A two-period/two-intervention design was chosen; each intervention comprised audio-guided placement of PPE, full-body spraying of fluorescent solution, audio-guided removal of PPE, and self-contamination assessment through ultraviolet light scanning. The primary outcome was the mean within-participant difference (any traces) between PPE suits. Statistical significance was tested using t-tests for paired data. The allocation ratio was 25/35 (gown followed by coverall/coverall followed by gown). FINDINGS: Self-contamination after removal of coveralls was greater than that after removal of gowns, with a mean within-participant difference of 11.45 traces (95% confidence interval 8.26-14.635; P<0.001). Significant differences were found for the number of self-contaminated body zones, small fluorescent traces, and large fluorescent traces. Removal of a gown was associated with a markedly lower risk of self-contamination. CONCLUSIONS: Quick one-step removal of a gown and gloves may reduce self-contamination in the arm/hand area.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is needed to detect new viral threats. Equally important is building local capacity to develop the tools required for rapid diagnosis of plant viruses. Most plant viruses are insect-vectored, hence, biological insights on virus transmission are vital in modelling disease spread. Research in Africa in these three areas is in its infancy and disjointed. Despite intense interest, uptake of HTS by African researchers is hampered by infrastructural gaps. The use of whole-genome information to develop field-deployable diagnostics on the continent is virtually inexistent. There is fledgling research into plant-virus-vector interactions to inform modelling of viral transmission. The gains so far have been modest but encouraging, and therefore must be consolidated.

METHODS: Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed of 4 patients presenting with new-onset acute VKH disease who elected to receive initial treatment consisting of bilateral sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide combined with immediately starting oral cyclosporine without the use of systemic corticosteroids. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 17.0 months. Choroidal thickness decreased to normal with recovery of bilateral best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 1.2 in 3 patients.

We aimed to establish whether inhaled budesonide reduces time to recovery and COVID-19-related hospital admissions or deaths among people at high risk of complications in the community. METHODS: PRINCIPLE is a multicentre, open-label, multi-arm, randomised, controlled, adaptive platform trial done remotely from a central trial site and at primary care centres in the UK. Eligible participants were aged 65 years or older or 50 years or older with comorbidities, and unwell for up to 14 days with suspected COVID-19 but not admitted to hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to usual care, usual care plus inhaled budesonide (800 g twice daily for 14 days), or usual care plus other interventions, and followed up for 28 days. Participants were aware of group assignment. The coprimary endpoints are time to first self-reported recovery and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19, within 28 days, analysed using Bayesian models. The primary analysis population included all eligible SARS-CoV-2-positive participants randomly assigned to budesonide, usual care, and other interventions, from the start of the platform trial until the budesonide group was closed. This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN86534580) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: The trial began enrolment on April 2, 2020, with randomisation to budesonide from Nov 27, 2020, until March 31, 2021, when the prespecified time to recovery superiority criterion was met. 4700 participants were randomly assigned to budesonide (n=1073), usual care alone (n=1988), or other treatments (n=1639). The primary analysis model includes 2530 SARS-CoV-2-positive participants, with 787 in the budesonide group, 1069 in the usual care group, and 974 receiving other treatments. There was a benefit in time to first self-reported recovery of an estimated 294 days (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 119 to 512) in the budesonide group versus the usual care group (118 days [95% BCI 100 to 141] vs 147 days [123 to 180]; hazard ratio 121 [95% BCI 108 to 136]), with a probability of superiority greater than 0999, meeting the prespecified superiority threshold of 099. For the hospital admission or death outcome, the estimated rate was 68% (95% BCI 41 to 102) in the budesonide group versus 88% (55 to 127) in the usual care group (estimated absolute difference 20% [95% BCI C02 to 45]; odds ratio 075 [95% BCI 055 to 103]), with a probability of superiority 0963, below the prespecified superiority threshold of 0975. Two participants in the budesonide group and four in the usual care group had serious adverse events (hospital admissions unrelated to COVID-19).

However, there is no consensus on the definition and measurement of resilience in the context of physical disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to summarize the range of definitions of physical disease resilience and the approaches taken to study it in studies examining physical disease and its relationship to resilient outcomes. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from inception to March 2013 for studies in which physical disease was assessed for its association with resilient outcomes. Article screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were carried out independently by 2 reviewers, with disagreements being resolved by a third reviewer. The results were combined using a narrative technique. RESULTS: Of 2280 articles, 12 met the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 1 was of high quality, 9 were of moderate quality, and 2 were low quality. The common findings were that resilience involves maintaining healthy levels of functioning following adversity and that it is a dynamic process not a personality trait. Studies either assessed resilience based on observed outcomes or via resilience measurement scales. They either considered physical disease as an adversity leading to resilience or as a variable modifying the relationship between adversity and resilience. CONCLUSION: This work begins building consensus as to the approach to take when defining and measuring physical disease resilience. Resilience should be considered as a dynamic process that varies across the life-course and across different domains, therefore the choice of a resilience measure should reflect this.","output":"Physical Disease and Resilient Outcomes: A Systematic Review of Resilience Definitions and Study Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new species of Tetragonopterus is described from lowland rivers of Central Amazon.

In addition, individuals face a variety of post-migration living difficulties (PMLDs). Complex posttraumatic stress symptoms are among the most common mental health problems in this population, and were associated with the overall burden of PMLDs. The complex interplay of posttraumatic symptoms has been investigated from a network perspective in previous studies. However, individuals are embedded in and constantly react to the environment, which makes it important to include external factors in network models to better understand the etiology and maintaining factors of posttraumatic mental health problems. PMLDs are a major risk factor for posttraumatic distress and considering their impact in interventions might improve response rates. However, the interaction of these external factors with posttraumatic psychopathological distress is not yet fully understood. Thus, we aimed to illuminate the complex interaction between PMLDs and CPTSD symptom clusters. OBJECTIVE: The main objective is the exploration of the network structure and the complex interplay of ICD-11 CPTSD symptom clusters and distinct forms of PMLDs. METHOD: The symptom clusters of CPTSD and PMLDs were collected within a randomised controlled trial among 93 treatment-seeking Afghan asylum seekers and refugees via a fully structured face-to-face and interpreter assisted interview. Using a network analytical approach, we explored the complex associations and network centrality of the CPTSD symptom clusters and the PMLD factors: discrimination & socio-economical living conditions, language acquisition & barriers, family concerns, and residence insecurity. RESULTS: The results suggest direct links within and between the constructs (CPTSD, PMLD). Almost all PMLD factors were interrelated and associated to CPTSD, family concerns was the only isolated variable. The CPTSD symptom cluster re-experiencing and the PMLD factor language acquisition & barriers connected the two constructs. Affective dysregulation had the highest and avoidance the lowest centrality. CONCLUSIONS: Re-experiencing and affective dysregulation have the strongest ties to PMLDs. Thus, these domains might explain the strong association of posttraumatic psychopathology with PLMDs and, consequently, prioritization of these domains in treatment approaches might both facilitate treatment response and reduce burden caused by PMLDs.

The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory from a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (FEMA) to different states in the US. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In an extreme case, where the demand is assumed to be concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 28,500 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 2,700 ventilators on 04/12/20. The results also suggest that in the worse-than-average to severe demand scenario cases, NY requires between 7,600-9,200 additional ventilators for COVID-19 patients during its peak demand. However, between 400 to 2,000 of these ventilators can be given to a different state after the peak demand in NY has subsided.","output":"A Model for Supply-Chain Decisions for Resource Sharing with an Application to Ventilator Allocation to Combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dialysis patients constitute a risk group for coronavirus infection due to their immunosuppressed condition, with the increased risk of morbidity and mortality that this entails.

It began enrolling patients with COVID-19 hospitalizations in March 2020. Patients with influenza were compared with those with COVID-19 in the first months of the U.S. epidemic. METHODS: Adults aged  18 years admitted to hospitals in 4 sites with acute respiratory illness were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Demographic and illness characteristics were collected for influenza illnesses during 3 seasons 2016C2019. Similar data were collected on COVID-19 cases admitted before June 19, 2020. RESULTS: Age groups hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 914) were similar to those admitted with influenza (n = 1937); 80% of patients with influenza and 75% of patients with COVID-19 were aged 50 years. Deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in younger patients were less often related to underlying conditions.

Therefore, it is very important for epidemic prevention and control to study the law of virus decay and the environmental coupling effect on various surfaces. Based on the analysis of the influencing mechanism, a large amount of experimental evidence on the survival of viruses on the surface of objects were excavated in this paper, and the effects of various factors, such as surface peripheral temperature, relative humidity, virus-containing droplet volume, surface materials and virus types, on the decay rate constants of viruses were comprehensively analyzed. It was found that although the experimental methods, virus types and experimental conditions varied widely in different experiments, the virus concentrations on the surface of objects all followed the exponential decay law, and the coupling effect of various factors was reflected in the decay rate constant k. Under different experimental conditions, k values ranged from 0.001 to 100 h-1, with a difference of 5 orders of magnitude, corresponding to the characteristic time t99 between 500 and 0.1 h when the virus concentration decreased by 99%. This indicates a large variation in the risk of virus transmission in different scenarios. By revealing the common law and individuality of the virus decay on the surface of objects, the essential relationship between the experimental observation phenomenon and virus decay was analyzed.

Therefore, PLpros are attractive targets for antiviral drug development. Here we report the crystal structure of the papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub). The X-ray structural analyses reveal that PEDV PLP2 interacts with Ub substrate mainly through the Ub core region and C-terminal tail. Mutations of Ub-interacting residues resulted in moderately or completely abolished deubiquitinylating function of PEDV PLP2. In addition, our analyses also indicate that the two residues-extended blocking loop 2 at the S4 subsite contributes to the substrate selectivity and binding affinity of PEDV PLP2. Furthermore, the PEDV PLP2 Glu99 residue, conserved in alpha-CoV PLpros, was found to govern the preference of a positively charged P4 residue of peptidyl substrates. Collectively, our data provided structure-based information for substrate binding and selectivity of PEDV PLP2. These findings may help us gain insights into the deubiquitinating and proteolytic functions of PEDV PLP2 from a structural perspective. Importance Current challenges in CoVs include a comprehensive understanding of mechanistic effects of associated enzymes, including the 3C-like and papain-like proteases. We have previously reported that the PEDV PLP2 exhibits a broader substrate preference, superior DUB function, and inferior peptidase activity. However, the structure basis for these functions remains largely unclear. Here, we show the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of PEDV PLP2 in complex with Ub. Integrated structural and biochemical analyses revealed: (i) three Ub-core interacting residues are essential for DUB function, (ii) two-residue-elongated blocking loop 2 regulates substrate selectivity, and (iii) a conserved glutamate residue governs the substrate specificity of PEDV PLP2.

Vegetation and green spaces have shown reductive effects on air-borne pollutants concentrations, especially of particulate matter (PM). Guidance on green space utilisation for air quality control remains scarce, however, as does its application in practise. To strengthen the foundation for research and interventions, we undertook a critical review of the state of science from a public health perspective. We used inter-disciplinary search strategies for published reviews on green spaces and air pollution in key scientific databases. Using the PRISMA checklist, we systematically identified reviews with quantitative analyses. For each of the presented PM mitigation mechanisms, we conducted additional searches focused on the most recent articles published between 2016 and early 2021. The included reviews differentiate three mitigation mechanisms of green spaces for PM: deposition, dispersion and modification. The most studied mechanism is deposition, particularly measures of mass and settling velocity of PM on plant leaves. We consolidate how green space setups differ by scale and context in their potentials to reduce peak exposures, stationary (point) or mobile (line) pollution sources, and the potentially most harmful PM components. The assessed findings suggest diverse optimisation options for green space interventions, particularly concerning plant selection, spatial setup, ventilation and maintenance - all alongside the consideration of supplementary vegetation effects like on temperature or water. Green spaces' reductive effects on air-borne PM concentrations are considerable, multi-mechanistic and varied by scale, context and vegetation characteristics. Such effect-modifying factors must be considered when rethinking public space design, as accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Weak linkages amid involved disciplines motivate the development of a research framework to strengthen health-oriented guidance.

Results We found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media sources and high-quality academic research. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English COVID-19 articles from 2001-2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness.

We conducted a prospective observational study of 43 children hospitalized with febrile UTI. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected at admission and tested for 16 respiratory viruses by nucleic acid detection methods. Respiratory symptoms were recorded, and blood MxA levels were determined. The median age of study children was 4 months (interquartile range, 2C14 months). A respiratory virus was detected in 17 (40%) children with febrile UTI. Of the virus-positive children with febrile UTI, 7 (41%) had simultaneous respiratory symptoms. Blood MxA levels were higher in virus-positive children with respiratory symptoms (median, 778 [interquartile range, 535C2538] g/L) compared to either virus-negative (155 [94C301] g/L, P < 0.001) or virus-positive (171 [112C331] g/L, P = 0.006) children without respiratory symptoms at presentation with febrile UTI.

Consequently, revealing the evolutionary and cognitive antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and vaccination intention has become crucial. Drawing on the theory of behavioral immune system (BIS), we investigate whether perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD) is associated with vaccination intentions through the need for cognitive closure (NCC) and vaccine hesitancy. The data was collected from 525 adults from Turkey. The structural equation modeling results indicate that of the two dimensions of PVD, germ aversion predicts COVID-19 vaccination intention through sequential mediation of NCC and vaccine hesitancy. Perceived infectability, on the other hand, is directly and positively related to vaccination intention. By showing the mediating role of NCC, our results offer an insight as to why germ aversion translates into vaccine hesitancy, and low vaccination intention. We discuss the potential benefits of considering the roles of BIS and NCC in campaigns and policies targeted at increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake and suggest implications for such practices.","output":"Linking the behavioral immune system to COVID-19 vaccination intention: The mediating role of the need for cognitive closure and vaccine hesitancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular imprinting (MI) is a technique that creates a template of a molecule for improving complementary binding sites in terms of size and shape to a peptide, protein, bacteria, mammalian cell, or virus on soft materials (such as polymers, hydrogels, or self-assembled materials).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, observations of global NO$_2$ emissions have shown significant decrease in urban areas. Drawing upon this example of NO$_2$ as an industrial byproduct, we use a one-dimensional photochemical model and synthetic spectral generator to assess the detectability of NO$_2$ as an atmospheric technosignature on exoplanets. We consider cases of an Earth-like planet around Sun-like, K-dwarf and M-dwarf stars. We find that NO$_2$ concentrations increase on planets around cooler stars due to less short-wavelength photons that can photolyze NO$_2$. In cloud-free results, present Earth-level NO$_2$ on an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10pc can be detected with SNR ~5 within ~400 hours with a 15 meter LUVOIR-like telescope when observed in the 0.2 - 0.7micron range where NO$_2$ has a strong absorption. However, clouds and aerosols can reduce the detectability and could mimic the NO$_2$ feature. Historically, global NO$_2$ levels were 3x higher, indicating the capability of detecting a 40-year old Earth-level civilization. Transit and direct imaging observations to detect infrared spectral signatures of NO$_2$ on habitable planets around M-dwarfs would need several 100s of hours of observation time, both due to weaker NO$_2$ absorption in this region, and also because of masking features by dominant H$_2$O and CO$_2$ bands in the infrared part of the spectrum.

Ethic and religious expressions of evil, understood as transgression and sin, are related to an active attitude, to an act of making. Innocent suffering, on the contrary, should be considered from the perspective of the victim. How to justify the pain of innocent victims of catastrophes, incurable diseases, violence? Is it possible, for example, to confer sense of the experience of the suffering of families that lose the fight against COVID-19? If God is fair, how could he allow the suffering of innocent people? The first part of the text will present how Paul Ricoeur understands the problem of evil from three main dimensions: the ethic dimension of transgression, the religious dimension of sin, and the dimension of innocent suffering. The second part will discuss the way Ricoeur regards suffering as challenge. According to Ricoeur, traditional dialectics is not able to provide meaning to innocent suffering. The problem of evil demands a convergence between thought and action, as well as the spiritual transformation of feelings.

The number of people learning through Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and other online resources has been increasing rapidly because they provide us with the flexibility to learn from anywhere at any time. This provides a good learning experience for the students. However, such learning interface requires the ability to recognize the level of engagement of the students for a holistic learning experience. This is useful for both students and educators alike. However, understanding engagement is a challenging task, because of its subjectivity and ability to collect data.

However, data are scarce on the association between multiple types of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and COVID-19. We aimed to assess the association between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and the subsequent risk of COVID-19 using UK Biobank. METHODS: For this cohort analysis, we included participants from UK Biobank who were registered in England and excluded individuals who died before Jan 31, 2020, (the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK) or had withdrawn from UK Biobank. Participants diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder before Jan 31 were included in the group of individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, whereas participants without a diagnosis before the outbreak were included in the group of individuals without pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We used the Public Health England dataset, UK Biobank hospital data, and death registers to collect data on COVID-19 cases. To examine the relationship between pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders and susceptibility to COVID-19, we used logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs), controlling for multiple confounders and somatic comorbidities. Key outcomes were all COVID-19, COVID-19 specifically diagnosed in inpatient care, and COVID-19-related deaths. ORs were also estimated separately for each psychiatric disorder and on the basis of the number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. As a positive disease control, we repeated analyses for hospitalisation for other infections. FINDINGS: We included 421 014 UK Biobank participants in our study and assessed their COVID-19 status between Jan 31 and July 26, 2020. 50 809 participants were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders before the outbreak, while 370 205 participants had no psychiatric disorders. The mean age at outbreak was 6780 years (SD 812). We observed an elevated risk of COVID-19 among individuals with pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders compared with that of individuals without such conditions. The fully adjusted ORs were 144 (95% CI 128C162) for All COVID-19 cases, 155 (134C178) for Inpatient COVID-19 cases, and 203 (159C259) for COVID-19-related deaths. We observed excess risk, defined as risk that increased with the number of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders, across all diagnostic categories of pre-pandemic psychiatric disorders. We also observed an association between psychiatric disorders and elevated risk of hospitalisation due to other infections (OR 174, 95% CI 158C193). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that pre-existing psychiatric disorders are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for surveillance of and care for populations with pre-existing psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Male gender and age &#8805; 60 years were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR = 4.33, 95% CI: 2.07-9.05 and 5.32, 95% CI: 3.13-9.04, respectively). Isolation of infected individuals and stricter quarantine of remaining individuals reduced the R0 from 2.41 initially to 1.17 subsequently. CONCLUSION: R0 value was found comparable to the earlier studies indicating similar transmission dynamics among quarantined individuals in India. Universal testing and prompt isolation of infected individuals reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Smaller group sizes should be preferred to large groups during facility-based quarantine in evacuation situations. The role of asymptomatic individuals appears to be strong in SARS-CoV-2 transmission within closed populations.","output":"Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Among Indian Nationals Evacuated From Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the moment, the best and only way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 is by limiting close contact with others Respecting social distance, infection is less probable Since this is a new lifestyle for everyone, its hard to be distance all the times People forget to keep distance or they are not taking seriously the actual situation Thats why in this paper, we propose a smart surveillance solution Our test prototype ensures the respect of social distancing by detecting persons, calculating distances between them and generating loud vocal alerts The smart surveillance prototype is based on Raspberry Pi and Camera Pi Then, we make a comparison study of object detection pretrained models SSD-MobileNet gives the most satisfying result using Raspberry pi with limited computing resources Despite that implementing CNN based model on the Raspberry Pi is such a challenging work, we reach a value of 1,1 FPS on real-time object detection and distance analysis system ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"A Smart Surveillance Prototype Ensures the Respect of Social Distance During COVID19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine whether, and to what extent companies disclosed pandemic risk and likely impact as part of their key risks or material matters immediately prior to 2020.

Of the participants, 70% intended to be vaccinated when the COVID-19 vaccine was approved under Emergency Use Administration, among 2171 valid questionnaires. Logistic regression revealed that being male, having a high cognitive score regarding COVID-19, the belief that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective, and the belief that one will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 this fall and winter, were associated with a greater probability of accepting vaccination. Respondents with junior college/university education or above were less likely to accept vaccination. Concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine were the main factors hindering vaccination acceptance.

Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, which are considered the gold standard for the treatment of most mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: This review investigates standalone smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) built on principles derived from CBT that aim to improve mental health. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between January 1, 2007, and January 15, 2020. We included studies focusing on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, efficacy, or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, for example, app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, that is, choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in the primary outcomes used in the studies. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (mean 70.8%, SD 15.3; n=4 studies) and satisfying for users (mean 72.6%, SD 17.2; n=7 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily lives. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable, and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.","output":"Standalone Smartphone Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Ecological Momentary Interventions to Increase Mental Health: Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"Pharmacotherapeutic Modifications in Cardiopulmonary Patients during COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is producing a huge health care burden with millions of cases and thousands of deaths.

HPIV-3 infections are currently untreatable with licensed therapeutics, and prophylactic and therapeutic options are needed for patients at risk. To complement existing human airway models of HPIV-3 infection and develop an animal model to assess novel intervention strategies, we evaluated infection and transmission of HPIV-3 in ferrets. A well-characterized human clinical isolate (CI) of HPIV-3 engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (rHPIV-3 CI-1-EGFP) was passaged on primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) or airway organoids (AO) to avoid tissue culture adaptations. rHPIV3 CI-1-EGFP infection was assessed in vitro in ferret AO and in ferrets in vivo. Undifferentiated and differentiated ferret AO cultures supported rHPIV-3 CI-1-EGFP replication, but the ferret primary airway cells from AO were less susceptible and permissive than HAE. In vivo rHPIV-3 CI-1-EGFP replicated in the upper and lower airways of ferrets and targeted respiratory epithelial cells, olfactory epithelial cells, type I pneumocytes, and type II pneumocytes. The infection efficiently induced specific antibody responses. Taken together, ferrets are naturally susceptible to HPIV-3 infection; however, limited replication was observed that led to neither overt clinical signs nor ferret-to-ferret transmission. However, in combination with ferret AO, the ferret model of HPIV-3 infection, tissue tropism, and neutralizing antibodies complements human ex vivo lung models and can be used as a platform for prevention and treatment studies for this important respiratory pathogen.","output":"Modeling Infection and Tropism of Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 in Ferrets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated radiologically suspected organizing pneumonia with repeated negative Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples, but positive result from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

The present study examined how characteristics of past and future thinking relate to psychological wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic. In an online questionnaire study, 904 participants in Germany and the USA recalled and predicted negative and positive events related to the pandemic. Participants completed a series of questionnaires measuring cognitions and psychological symptoms. Participants' current psychological wellbeing related to how they remembered events and thought of their future. Participants reported a greater sense of reliving for past compared to future events. However, future events were more rehearsed than past events. Additionally, the emotional impact of positive and negative events differed for the past and the future.

Data from an international Austrian company were used. The study adopted cross tabulation for analysing the relationships of commuting (carbon emissions) in different periods in relation to face-to-display environmental benefits. The study analysed whether the major benefit of e-working, namely not commuting to work, can reduce carbon emissions. Real evidence of decarbonisation data from an Austrian company was provided. There are significant differences in the numbers of workers in cubicles and at home during the periods. The study reveals that face-to-display work can save CO2 emissions by reducing work-related trips. The data obtained offer a stimulating view of potential carbon emissions savings if employees continue working from home. Additionally, further saving factors correlate with the findings of this study, in particular decreases in energy consumption. Based on the data received, after the easing of the lockdown period, full e-workers mitigated the extent of their carbon footprint by almost 62% because of transport emissions. Moreover, in that period, 126 072 kg of CO2 emission of energy consumption was saved. Generally, the results indicate that an increase of e-workers tends to decrease the footprint from transport emissions and energy consumption. This paper finds that workers working remotely decrease the carbon foot print as a result of zero commuting and energy consumption during different periods of the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings show that more long-term and comprehensive studies are needed, especially in relation to e-workers who have invested in lower-emission home offices. This study has contributed to highlighting the environmental benefit of reducing CO2 emissions of face-to-display workers by not commuting to work.

Within the common framework for global climate action, an increased reliance on renewable energy sources, which would assist countries to reduce energy imports and cut fossil fuel use, emerged as the solution towards achieving worldwide energy security and sustainability through carbon-neutrality. As such, this study is aimed to investigate the heterogeneous effects of relevant economic and environmental driving factors for renewable energy consumption (REC) that emerge from current policy objectives (GDP per capita, carbon intensity, and research and development) through an empirical analysis of a wide panel of 94 countries, and five income-based subpanels, over the 1995C2019 period, by using heterogeneous panel data fixed-effects estimation techniques (static and dynamic) with robust DriscollCKraay standard errors. The results unambiguously indicate that CO2 intensity has a significant mitigating effect on REC at world level, and this relationship is stronger for low-income and very high-income countries. Moreover, GDP per capita promotes REC when it surpasses the 5000 USD threshold, whereas research and development is a major contributor to increase in renewable energy consumption in very high-income countries. As such, for the policy makers, it is necessary to consider the heterogeneity of the drivers of REC in order to issue effective and congruent policies.

To convince individuals to engage in behaviors that limit infection, public health professionals communicate risk and hazard based on application of protection motivation theory (PMT). The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to explore the efficacy of PMT in the context of a novel coronavirus with unique public health implications. We test an integrative conceptual model of social distancing compliance in U.S. counties and examine the mediating impact of SD on community spread of infection. We find that PMT does impact individual behavior, observing that the proportion of vulnerable populations affects social distancing compliance. However, actions to protect individual health are made within the context of economic concerns and priorities. While results indicate that PMT influences behavior, the expected relationship between that behavior and spread of disease in the community is not found. We do not repudiate SD or the value of PMT, but we suggest that these results may indicate that communication of risk in the context of COVID-19 may need community, as well as individual, framing.","output":"The impact of social distancing on community case count in the United States: Testing the efficacy of protection motivation theory during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic play out globally, the banking industry has been affected in both positive and negative ways, with the crisis creating both opportunities and threats for the collaborations between FinTech and banks The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of FinTech products (FTPs) on commercial bank's performance in China Required data are collected with a quantitative approach and two self-designed questionnaires were distributed to customers and employees of commercial banks in China The gathered data were examined using the structural equation modeling technique The results of this study reveal that the perceived usefulness (PU) of FTPs has positive and significant impacts on customer satisfaction, low expectation of bank employee assistance, bank's service quality and employee work efficiency Additionally, the perceived difficulty of use (PD) of FTPs has negative and significant impacts on customer satisfaction and low expectation of assistance Interestingly, there is a positive and significant relationship between PD and banks' service quality and work efficiency, meaning that the service quality and work efficiency can reduce some shortcomings of using FTPs This study recognizes the need to enhance the understanding of FTPs on non-financial firm performance This is the first study that helps commercial banks in China understand the perception of FTPs from both customer and employee perspectives","output":"FinTech and commercial banks' performance in China: A leap forward or survival of the fittest?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As SARS-CoV-2 triggered a global health crisis, there is an urgent need to provide patients with safe, effective, accessible, and preferably oral therapeutics for COVID-19 that complement mRNA vaccines.

These students relatedness with their teachers and peers has been limited and mainly online. Several studies have indicated that students emotional states and mental health have been negatively affected by the pandemic, representing a serious challenge for many countries. Because they use only digital tools, online students have perceived a decline in teacher and peer support. Likewise, these students have reported feelings of sadness, loneliness, anxiety, and stress, affecting their learning and competence development. AIMS: To investigate the associations between peer support, teacher support, emotional state, and perceived competence in nursing students during the pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study collected quantitative survey data from 329 nursing students at a large university in Norway. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test seven associations among peer support, teacher support, emotional state, and perceived competence. RESULTS: Teacher support had a significant direct effect on perceived competence, while peer support almost had a significant direct effect. However, the emotional state was directly affected by peer support and had a direct impact on perceived competence. Hence, teacher and peer support is important to nursing students perceived competence. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, both peer and teacher support can significantly support students competence development. Therefore, students should utilize the support of their teachers and peers in a structured manner to bolster their competence development.","output":"Nursing Students Emotional State and Perceived Competence During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Vital Role of Teacher and Peer Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The early identification of asymptomatic yet infectious cases is vital to curb the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and to control the disease in the post-pandemic era. In this paper, we propose a fast, inexpensive and high-throughput approach using painless nasal-swab self-collection followed by direct RT-qPCR for the sensitive PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This approach was validated in a large prospective cohort study of 1038 subjects, analysed simultaneously using (1) nasopharyngeal swabs obtained with the assistance of healthcare personnel and analysed by classic two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates and (2) nasal swabs obtained by self-collection and analysed with direct RT-qPCR. Of these subjects, 28.6% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swab sampling. Our direct RT-qPCR approach for self-collected nasal swabs performed well with results similar to those of the two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates, achieving 0.99 positive and 0.98 negative predictive values (cycle threshold [Ct] < 37). Our research also reports on grey-zone viraemia, including samples with near-cut-off Ct values (Ct  37). In all investigated subjects (n = 20) with grey-zone viraemia, the ultra-small viral load disappeared within hours or days with no symptoms. Overall, this study underscores the importance of painless nasal-swab self-collection and direct RT-qPCR for mass testing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and in the post-pandemic era.","output":"Excellent option for mass testing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: painless self-collection and direct RT-qPCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There was an epidemic of diarrhoea affecting pigs of all ages in Italy between May 2005 and June 2006.

This is frequently difficult to realize due to restricted spatial capacities. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the possibility of enabling patients to spend the waiting period outside of the waiting room of the ENT outpatient department, in order to reduce the number of patients in the waiting rooms and therefore observe distancing rules. This was realized by the use of a pager system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the timeframe of 12.5 weeks (04.06.2020-31.08.2020), ENT outpatients were issued with pagers. The patients could thus move freely within the hospital and grounds. The pager system was activated 10-15a?min before the appointment, to call patients back to the outpatient ENT clinic. questionnaires were used to evaluate the system and examine patients' acceptance and satisfaction. RESULTS: The 137 questionnaires analyzed showed satisfaction with the system, not only regarding distancing rules but also with the more comfortable waiting time.

This cross-sectional study utilized secondary data from 23,629 registered nurses in 503 hospitals from a four-state survey collected in 2005-2008. Each 10% increase in the proportion of patients who are economically disadvantaged was associated with 27% and 22% decreased odds of rating unit-level care quality as excellent and giving an \\"A\\" safety grade, respectively.

Treatment of tuberculosis (TB) involves the use of multiple antibiotics over a prolonged period. However, the emergence of resistance leading to multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is the most challenging aspect of TB treatment. Therefore, there is a constant need to search for novel therapeutic strategies that could tackle the growing problem of drug resistance. One such strategy could be perturbing the functions of novel targets in Mtb, such as universal stress protein (USP, Rv1636), which binds to cAMP with a higher affinity than ATP. Orthologs of these proteins are conserved in all mycobacteria and act as sink for cAMP, facilitating the availability of this second messenger for signaling when required. Here, we have used the cAMP-bound crystal structure of USP from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a closely related homolog of Mtb, to conduct a structure-guided hunt for potential binders of Rv1636, primarily employing molecular docking approach. A library of 1.9 million compounds was subjected to virtual screening to obtain an initial set of ~2,000 hits. An integrative strategy that uses the available experimental data and consensus indications from other computational analyses has been employed to prioritize 22 potential binders of Rv1636 for experimental validations. Binding affinities of a few compounds among the 22 prioritized compounds were tested through microscale thermophoresis assays, and two compounds of natural origin showed promising binding affinities with Rv1636. We believe that this study provides an important initial guidance to medicinal chemists and biochemists to synthesize and test an enriched set of compounds that have the potential to inhibit Mtb USP (Rv1636), thereby aiding the development of novel antitubercular lead candidates.","output":"Identification of Potential Binders of Mtb Universal Stress Protein (Rv1636) Through an in silico Approach and Insights Into Compound Selection for Experimental Validation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mentors at seven United States and Australian academic institutions partnered with seven leading Indian academic palliative care and cancer centers to undertake a program combining remote and in-person mentorship, didactic instruction, and project-based learning in quality improvement.

Seventy male rats were allocated to groups: (i) control; (ii) MoO3-NPs (500 mg/kg); (iii) CdCl2 (6.5 mg/kg); (iv) RJ (85 mg/kg diluted in saline); (v) MoO3-NPs followed by RJ (30 min after the MoO3-NPs dose); (vi) CdCl2 followed by RJ; and (vii) a combination of MoO3-NPs and CdCl2, followed by RJ, for a total of 30 successive days. Hepatic functions, lipid profile, inflammation marker (CRP), antioxidant biomarkers (SOD, CAT, GPx, and MDA), and genotoxicity were examined. Histological changes, an immunological marker for caspase-3, and transmission electron microscope variations in the liver were also investigated to indicate liver status. The results showed that RJ alleviated the hepatotoxicity of MoO3-NPs and/or CdCl2 by improving all hepatic vitality markers. In conclusion, the RJ was more potent and effective as an antioxidant over the oxidative damage induced by the combination of MoO3-NPs and CdCl2.","output":"Possible Ameliorative Effects of the Royal Jelly on Hepatotoxicity and Oxidative Stress Induced by Molybdenum Nanoparticles and/or Cadmium Chloride in Male Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Colchicine, because of its anti-inflammatory and possible anti-viral properties, has been proposed as potential therapeutic option for COVID-19. The role of colchicine to mitigate cytokine storm and to decrease the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19 has been evaluated in many studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of colchicine on morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations. The literature search was conducted in 6 medical databases from inception to February 17, 2021 to identify studies evaluating colchicine as a therapeutic agent in COVID-19. All included studies were evaluated for risk of bias (ROB) using the Revised Cochrane ROB tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for case-control and cohort studies. RESULTS: Four RCTs and four observational studies were included in the final analysis. One study evaluated colchicine in outpatients, while all others evaluated inpatient use of colchicine. There was significant variability in treatment protocols for colchicine and standard of care in all studies. A statistically significant decrease in all-cause mortality was observed in three observational studies. The risk of mechanical ventilation was significantly reduced only in one observational study. Length of hospitalisation was significantly reduced in two RCTs. Risk for hospitalisation was not significantly decreased in the study evaluating colchicine in outpatients. Very few studies had low risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Based on the available data, colchicine shall not be recommended to treat COVID-19. Further high-quality and multi-center RCTs are required to assess the meaningful impact of this drug in COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory agent has demonstrated anti-viral properties in in-vitro studies by degrading the microtubules, as well as by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Colchicine has been studied as a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19, with variable results. Until further research can establish the efficacy of colchicine in COVID-19, the use of colchicine in COVID-19 shall be restricted to clinical trials.","output":"Impact of colchicine on mortality and morbidity in COVID-19: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 caused a major outbreak of severe pneumonia (COVID-19) in humans.

The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of amniotic membrane allograft as a mechanical barrier to decrease adhesion formation. METHODS Ten patients having flexor tendon injuries were planned to be recruited to the pilot study. The operative treatment consisted of tendon repair and fixation of amniotic membrane allograft around the repaired tendon. The primary outcome variable was the range of motion of the operated finger 6 months after the operation. Patients were monitored for infections and repair failures. RESULTS The study was terminated owing to unfavorable results after treatment of 5 patients. One patient had extensive stiffness and was subjected to tenolysis and joint release. Histopathological analysis of the tendon sheath revealed focal fibrosis. Another patient had a repair failure. The other 3 patients had fair to good results. CONCLUSIONS It seems improbable that the use of amniotic membrane allograft would yield clinically relevant improvement compared with the existing techniques. However, it remains unclear whether the unfavorable results are associated with technical factors, amniotic membrane allograft itself, or an irregular distribution of complications.

Maintaining social distancing and offering staggered work schedules. Due to a decrease in patients seeking health care at the onset of the pandemic, a temporary decrease in patient specimens was observed.

The hot and dry climatic extremes have most likely acted as the primary trigger of the recent and perhaps also of prehistoric mass mortality events. As such climate extremes are projected to become more frequent in Southern Africa in the near future, there is a risk that similar tragedies may take place, rendering African megafauna species, especially those that are already endangered, in risk of extinction. Moreover, cyanotoxin poisoning amplified by climate change may have unexpected cascading effects on human societies. Seen within this perspective, the tragic mass death of the world's largest terrestrial mammal species serves as an alarming early warning signal of future environmental catastrophes in Southern Africa.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand whether oropharyngeal swab (OPS), saliva, and dried blood spot (DBS) specimens collected by participants at home and mailed to a laboratory were sufficient for use in diagnostic and serology tests of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Eligible participants consented online and were mailed a participant-collection kit to support collection of three specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing: saliva, OPS, and DBS. Participants performed the specimen collection procedures during a telehealth video appointment while clinical observers watched and documented the suitability of the collection. The biological sufficiency of the specimens for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction and serology testing was assessed by laboratorians using visual inspection and quantification of the nucleic acid contents of the samples by ribonuclease P (RNase P) measurements. RESULTS: Of the enrolled participants,153/159 (96.2%) returned their kits, which were included in this analysis. All these participants attended their video appointments. Clinical observers assessed that of the samples collected, 147/153 (96.1%) of the saliva samples, 146/151 (96.7%) of the oropharyngeal samples, and 135/145 (93.1%) of the DBS samples were of sufficient quality for submission for laboratory testing; 100% of the OPS samples and 98% of the saliva samples had cycle threshold values for RNase P <30, indicating that the samples contained sufficient nucleic acid for RNA-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Current literature is unclear on whether the Alpha variant is associated with increased severity. We linked clinical data with viral genome sequence data to compare admitted cases between SARS-CoV-2 waves in London and to investigate the association between the Alpha variant and the severity of disease. METHODS: Clinical, demographic, laboratory and viral sequence data from electronic health record systems were collected for all cases with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test between 13 March 2020 and 17 February 2021 in a multisite London healthcare institution. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression assessed risk factors for severity as defined by hypoxia at admission. RESULTS: There were 5810 SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive cases of which 2341 were admitted (838 in wave 1 and 1503 in wave 2). Both waves had a temporally aligned rise in nosocomial cases (96 in wave 1 and 137 in wave 2). The Alpha variant was first identified on 15 November 2020 and increased rapidly to comprise 400/472 (85%) of sequenced isolates from admitted cases in wave 2.

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Individuals presenting for care at one of five study facilities in SSD (n=1) or DRC (n=4) or referred from home-based care by mobile medical teams between December 2020 and June 2021 were eligible for enrolment. Demographic characteristics, COVID-19 exposures, symptoms at presentation, as well as acute and chronic comorbidities, were evaluated using a standard questionnaire at enrolment. Disease progression was characterised by location of care using mixed-effects regression models. RESULTS: 751 individuals were eligible for enrolment. Among cases followed to discharge or death (n=519), 375 were enrolled outpatients (75.7%). A similar number of cases were enrolled in DRC (n=262) and SSD (n=257). Overall mortality was 4.8% (95% CI: 3.2% to 6.9%); there were no outpatient deaths. Patients presenting with any symptoms had higher odds of hospitalisation (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.78, 95% CI 1.47 to 5.27) and all deaths occurred among symptomatic individuals. Odds of both hospitalisation and mortality were greatest among cases with respiratory symptoms; presence of low oxygen levels on enrolment was strongly associated with both hospitalisation (AOR 7.77, 95% CI 4.22 to 14.29) and mortality (AOR 25.29, 95% CI 6.42 to 99.54).

Our aim is to report on the clinical characteristics, treatments and prognoses of COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre, case series of 136 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Wuhan Third Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 28 January 2020 and 12 February 2020. The clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment features and prognoses were summarized. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The 136 patients were divided into a moderate (M) group (n = 103, 75.7%) and a severe and critical (SC) group (n = 33, 24.3%). There were significant differences in the incidences of concomitant chronic medical illnesses (eg, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease), fever, dry cough and dyspnoea among the two groups (P < .05). Compared with those in the M group, lymphocyte count (LYM) decreased significantly in the SC group, while the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), creatinine (Cre), D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin (MB) and troponin I (cTnl) increased significantly in the SC group (P < .05). The main therapeutic drugs were antivirals, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, immunomodulators, traditional Chinese medicine preparations and symptomatic support drugs. There were significant differences in the incidences of shock, myocardial injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and renal injury among the two groups (P < .05).

The improvement of LYM and CRP may be associated with the prognoses of COVID-19. The combined use of three or more antiviral drugs is to be avoided. The combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs is not recommended and the risk of drug-induced liver injury should be monitored.

The pooled adverse event rates for TA and OA were 25% and 7%, respectively. Moreover, TA was comparable to OD to treat MGD regarding symptom score, TBUT and tear secretion. This study showed that MGD could be treated effectively with oral or topical azithromycin by improving symptoms, clinical signs, and stabilization of tear film. Topical azithromycin seemed to be superior over oral azithromycin or doxycycline in improving the quality of tear film in the short term.","output":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of treating meibomian gland dysfunction with azithromycin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Due to low therapeutic efficacy and severe adverse reaction of systemic administration for coronary heart disease (CHD) therapy, we designed a novel local target delivery system, called Active hydraulic ventricular Support Drug delivery system (ASD). This study aims to investigate the potential advantages of ASD compared to intrapericardial (IPC) injection and factors affecting drug absorption through epicardium. METHODS Liposoluble, water soluble and viscous solutions of cyanine 5 (Cy5) fluorescent dye were delivered individually through ASD and IPC in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and then tissues were isolated and observed by in vivo imaging system. Atria and ventricles of the heart were taken for the paraffin section and observed under a fluorescence microscope. RESULTS The fluorescence intensity of Cy5 injected by ASD distributed in the heart was significantly higher than IPC injection. Whereas, the fluorescence signal spread in other tissues such as lung, liver, spleen, and kidney of ASD groups was much weaker. Moreover, when choosing liposoluble and viscous Cy5, the intensity of the heart turned stronger and fluorescence dye distributed in other tissues was lesser. CONCLUSIONS The application of ASD device may provide a promising route of drug delivery for CHD.

METHODS: We were tasked to construct and evaluate COVID-19 driven predictive models to identify possible planning and resource utilisation scenarios. We used system dynamics to derive a series of chain susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) models. We then built a discrete event simulation using the system dynamics output and bootstrapped electronic medical record data to approximate the weekly effect of tuning surgical volume on hospital census. We evaluated performance via a model fit assessment and cross-model comparison. RESULTS: We outlined the design and implementation of predictive models to support management decision making around areas impacted by COVID-19. The fit assessments indicated the models were most useful after 30 days from onset of local cases. We found our subreports were most accurate up to 7 days after model run. Discusssion Our model allowed us to shape our health systems executive policy response to implement a hospital within a hospitalone for patients with COVID-19 within a hospital able to care for the regular non-COVID-19 population. The surgical scheduleis modified according to models that predict the number of new patients withCovid-19 who require admission. This enabled our hospital to coordinateresources to continue to support the community at large. Challenges includedthe need to frequently adjust or create new models to meet rapidly evolvingrequirements, communication, and adoption, and to coordinate the needs ofmultiple stakeholders.

However, like their real-numbered counterpart, quantized networks are not immune to malicious misclassification caused by adversarial attacks. We investigate how quantization affects a networks robustness to adversarial attacks, which is a formal verification question. We show that neither robustness nor non-robustness are monotonic with changing the number of bits for the representation and, also, neither are preserved by quantization from a real-numbered network. For this reason, we introduce a verification method for quantized neural networks which, using SMT solving over bit-vectors, accounts for their exact, bit-precise semantics. We built a tool and analyzed the effect of quantization on a classifier for the MNIST dataset. We demonstrate that, compared to our method, existing methods for the analysis of real-numbered networks often derive false conclusions about their quantizations, both when determining robustness and when detecting attacks, and that existing methods for quantized networks often miss attacks. Furthermore, we applied our method beyond robustness, showing how the number of bits in quantization enlarges the gender bias of a predictor for students grades.","output":"How Many Bits Does it Take to Quantize Your Neural Network?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the health-care systems all over the world. Among the booming literatures about COVID-19, there is yet a paucity of study addressing the association between COVID-19 and cancer, which is a rare comorbidity of COVID-19, as well as consensus for treatment of cancer in this pandemic. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, information of all inpatient cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had treatment outcome were collected from the designated departments in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China on March 10, 2020. Demographic data, clinical information, and treatment outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Severe events were defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Result: A total of 716 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were identified. Among them, a total of 12 cases (1.7%, 95% CI: 0.7%-2.6%) had history of cancer with 4 cases (33%) experienced severe events. Compared with cases without cancer, patients with cancer have higher risks of severe events (33% vs 7.7%, p=0.012) and deaths (25% vs 3.6%, p=0.009). Multivariable logistic regression model showed that cancer was independently associated with increased odds of severe events after adjusting for other risk factors (OR 6.51, 95% CI 1.72-24.64; p=0.006). Among COVID-19 patients with cancer, we found that patients older than 60 years (75%), with other comorbidities (50%), or experiencing anticancer treatment in past month (42.9%) had a numerically higher incidence of severe events. Conclusion: Cancer is a rare comorbidity of patients with COVID-19; however, it cannot be overemphasized due to its poorer outcomes. We propose that personalized treatment recommendation for cancer patients should be addressed during COVID-19 pandemic, along with meticulous personal protective protocols for them to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Cancer patients in SARS-CoV-2 infection: A singlecenter experience from Wuhan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Achieving a healthy weight balance has been a central focus of care for people who have cystic fibrosis (CF).

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the necessity to create systems and devices capable of clearing the air in an environment of micro-organisms more efficiently. The development of systems that allow the removal of micro-droplets mainly originating from breathing or talking from the air was the motivation of this study. AIM: This article describes a portable and easy-to-operate system that helps to eliminate the droplets or aerosols present in the environment by circulating air through an ultraviolet-C (UV-C) reactor. METHODS: An air circulation device was developed, and a proof-of-principle study was performed using the device against bacteria in simulated and natural environments. The microbiological analysis was carried out by the simple sedimentation technique. In order to compare the experimental results and the expected results for other micro-organisms, the reduction rate values for bacteria and viruses were calculated and compared with the experimental results based on technical parameters (clean air delivery rate (CADR) and air changes per hour (ACH)). FINDINGS: Results showed that the micro-organisms were eliminated with high efficiency by the air circulation decontamination device, with reductions of 99.9% in the proof-of-principle study, and 84-97% in the hospital environments study, contributing to reducing contamination of individuals in environments considered to present risk.

In this analysis, we have extensively reviewed the regulatory pathways and decisions adopted by FDA and EMA to speed up the development, the review and the approval of these drugs, with the aim of identifying possible clinical and public health implications associated with differences. RESULTS CFTR modulators have been developed towards addressing three main genetic domains: (1) F508del homozygous (F508del/F508del), (2) F508del heterozygous, and (3) genotypes not carrying F508del mutation; and expanded from adult to paediatric population. Programs to expedite the reviewing and licensing of CFTR modulators were extensively adopted by FDA and EMA. All CFTR modulators have been licensed in the US as orphan drugs, but in the EU the orphan status for LUM/IVA was not confirmed at the time of marketing authorization as results from the pivotal trial were not considered clinically significant. While FDA and EMA approved CFTR modulators on the basis of results from phase III double-blind RCTs, main differences were found on the extension of indications: FDA accepted non-clinical evidence considering a recovery of the CFTR function  10% based on chloride transport, a reliable indicator to correlate with improvement in clinical outcomes. By contrast, EMA did not deem preclinical data sufficient to expand the label of CFTR modulators without confirmatory clinical data. CONCLUSIONS Regulators played an important role in fostering the development and approval of CFTR modulators. However, differences were found between FDA and EMA in the way of reviewing and licensing CFTR modulators, which extended beyond semantics affecting patients' eligibility and access: FDA's approach was more mechanistic/biology-driven while the EMA's one was more oriented by clinical evidence. This might refer to the connection between the EMA and the Member States, which tends to base decisions on pricing and reimbursement on clinical data rather than pre-clinical ones.

One of the major reasons for this (current) limitation is the inefficient formation of disulfide bonds, which are found in many, especially eukaryotic, proteins. Future exploitation of B. subtilis to fulfill the ever-growing demand for pharmaceutical and other high-value proteins will therefore depend on overcoming this particular hurdle.

Suppressing the activity of telomerase, a telomere-synthesizing enzyme, and maintaining short telomeres is a protective mechanism against cancer in humans. In most human somatic cells, the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is repressed and telomerase activity is inhibited. This leads to the progressive shortening of telomeres and inhibition of cell growth in a process called replicative senescence. Most types of primary cancer exhibit telomerase activation, which allows uncontrolled cell proliferation. Previous research indicates that TERT activation also affects cancer development through activities other than the canonical function of mediating telomere elongation. Recent studies have improved the understanding of the structure and function of telomeres and telomerase as well as key mechanisms underlying the activation of TERT and its role in oncogenesis.

With this study we aim to find the measles seroprevalence in travellers born between 1965 and 1975, compared to those born before 1965 and after 1975. METHODS Families travelling to Eastern Europe or outside Europe during the preceding year were recruited via Dutch secondary schools between 2016 and 2018.

Measles virus antibody concentrations were determined with an ELISA (EUROIMMUNE?) and a subset was retested with a focus reduction neutralization assay (FRNT). RESULTS In 188 (79%) of the 239 available DBS eluates, the ELISA could detect sufficient measles virus-specific IgG antibodies.

Fifty-eight cytologic preps (20 oral and 38 from the nasopharynx) were obtained from ten patients and analyzed in a blinded fashion for SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope protein by immunohistochemistry and viral RNA by in situ hybridization. qRTPCR identified three positive cases and seven controls; the three cases reported mild symptoms that resolved in 2-3 days. Blinded analyses confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins and viral RNA in the three cases and viral absence in the seven controls. A signal for the positive cases was evident in each nasopharyngeal and none of the oral samples. Viral RNA/proteins localized exclusively to glandular cells and was present in high copy number. Blinded analysis of the cytology documented that the glandular cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 showed marked degeneration with ciliocytophthoria; viral inclusions were not evident.

As this crisis continues, the need to revive virtual learning opportunities was seriously felt. The present study was conducted to determine the online flipped classrooms effect on nursing students self-directed learning readiness and metacognitive awareness. METHODS: This quasi-experimental single-group study with pretest-posttest design recruited 34 sophomore students of a nursing school in Lorestan province, Western Iran selected by census according to the inclusion criteria. Online asynchronous learning and online flipped classrooms were used during the semesters first and second eight weeks, respectively. Students filled out self-directed learning readiness scale and metacognitive awareness inventory online before, in the middle of, and at the end of the semester. Data were analyzed using paired t-test in Stata-14 software. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the mean score of metacognitive awareness before and after Online asynchronous learning (P=0.15), but the mean score of self-directed learning readiness increased significantly after OA (P=0.0004). After applying online flipped classrooms, students mean (SD) scores of metacognitive awareness and self-directed learning readiness were 272.03 (53.03) and 162.03 (21.77), respectively, which confirmed their significant improvement compared to before the intervention. A comparison of the mean score changes of both methods indicated that their implementation did not lead to significant differences between the mean total score of metacognitive awareness (P=0.15) and the mean total score of self-directed learning readiness (P=0.07).

Emerging evidence has suggested that research misconduct is far more common than we normally perceive. Far more problematic papers should be retracted than are being retracted because of poor actions when confronting research misconduct. Research misconduct is usually driven by incentives in the form of pursuing publications for researchers' career needs and is further facilitated by poor research governance. The current strategy that tackles potential research misconduct focuses on protecting the reputation of authors and their institutions but neglects the interests of patients, clinicians and honest researchers.

Homozygous individuals are likely at increased risk for thromboembolic complications. There are no formal guidelines regarding antiplatelet therapy in the short or long term for intracranial stent use in SCD. The authors describe the novel use of a pipeline embolization device (PED) to treat a ruptured dissecting bilobed/fusiform vertebral artery V4 aneurysm in an SCD patient complicated by tortuous proximal anatomy and the anterior spinal artery arising from the diseased segment. Considerations regarding antiplatelet therapy in this scenario are discussed. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old woman with homozygous recessive SCD was transported to the emergency department and presented with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. CT angiography demonstrated a left-sided 3  5 mm fusiform bi-lobulated presumed dissecting vertebral artery aneurysm, immediately distal to the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). A PED was deployed within the V4 segment across the aneurysm. Post-treatment angiography showed patency of the parent artery, and patency of the \\"jailed\\" anterior spinal artery and of the PICA. DISCUSSION Selecting a treatment method in SCD patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm is challenging and there are no clinical trials comparing treatment methods in this population.

The present cross-sectional study investigated adolescents feelings about their bodies and perceived changes in weight stigma from peers, parents, and social media during the pandemic. METHODS: Four hundred fifty-two adolescents (11C17 years old) completed an online survey during the Fall of 2020. Measures assessed perceived changes in exposure to weight stigmatizing social media content (stress eating jokes, weight gain memes) and experiences of weight stigma (weight-based bullying, teasing, hurtful comments) by parents and peers, as well as body dissatisfaction, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Weight status and gender were examined as individual difference variables. RESULTS: The majority (53%) of adolescents reported increased exposure to at least one form of weight stigmatizing social media content during the pandemic. Additionally, pandemic-related increases in body dissatisfaction were prevalent (41%), especially among girls with higher body mass index (85th percentile; 67%). On average, the extent to which adolescents experienced weight-based mistreatment from parents and peers remained consistent with their pre-pandemic experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings highlight changes in the social messages that adolescents receive about their bodies, as well as their subjective body satisfaction, during the pandemic. Results underscore the need for healthcare providers and mental health professionals to be aware of the potential rise in weight stigma during the pandemic, and encourage families and schools to engage in supportive, rather than stigmatizing, weight-related communication with youth.","output":"Adolescents Exposure to and Experiences of Weight Stigma During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Eosinopenia has been described in COVID-19.

COVID-19 lethality rates by histology were calculated; multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 mortality. The log-rank test was applied to compare the survival curves for each variable. RESULTS: Of the 411 patients analyzed, 51 (12.4%) died due to COVID-19. Death occurred at an average age of 63 years. The fatality rate was higher for lung (0.333) and hematological (0.213) cancers and was associated with age over 60 years. The greatest chances of death from COVID-19 were in cases of lung (odds ratio, OR, 4.05, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.33C12.34) and hematological (OR 2.17, 95% CI 0.96C4.90) cancers, and in patients currently undergoing cancer treatment (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.25C6.13).

Concerns regarding morbidity, mortality and quality of life have favored the introduction of bladder sparing strategies. Trimodal therapy, combining transurethral resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the current standard of care for bladder preservation strategies in selected patients with MIBC. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A comprehensive search of the Medline and Embase databases was performed. A total of 19 studies were included in a systematic review of bladder sparing strategies in MIBC management was carried out following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The overall median complete response rate after trimodal therapy (TMT) was 77% (55-93). Salvage cystectomy rate with TMT was 17% on average (8-30). For TMT, the 5-year cancer-specific survival and overall survival rates range from 42-82% and 32-74%, respectively. Currently data supporting neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in bladder sparing approaches are emerging, but robust definitive conclusions are still lacking. Gastrointestinal toxicity rates are low around 4% (0.5-16), whereas genitourinary toxicity rates reached 8% (1-24). Quality of life outcomes are still underreported. CONCLUSIONS Published data and clinical experience strongly support trimodal therapy as an acceptable bladder sparing strategy in terms of oncological outcomes and quality of life in selected patients with MIBC.

METHODS: During the first COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown in spring 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with patients and healthcare professionals at a clinic for psychosomatic medicine in Germany and analyzed them following the principles of descriptive phenomenology focusing on social interactions, intersubjectivity, and the therapeutic space. RESULTS: We conducted a total of >30 h of interviews with 19 patients and 17 healthcare professionals. Analyses revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures have led to a sudden loss of a sense of normality. Participants experienced changes in the perception of time, space, self, and embodied interaction with others, resulting in a profound feeling of alienation and unhomeliness which seemed to magnify pre-existing psychopathology. The inpatient psychotherapeutic environment provided safety by offering spatial and temporal structures and opportunities for social interaction, supporting people to find new ways to be in a changed world.

Although suggestive of DIC, the majority of patients do not fulfil ISTH criteria for DIC. Studies have demonstrated that when compared to D-dimer, fibrin monomers are more sensitive and specific when differentiating overt DIC from non-overt DIC. Our special coagulation laboratory (SCL) routinely measures soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) as part of our DIC profile in samples with elevated D-dimers. Here we aimed to investigate the percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection with elevated SFMC as performed as part of the DIC profile. Methods: Between April 1st 2020 and July 26, 2020 inpatients at the Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN campus with COVID-19 infection who underwent DIC testing in SCL were identified through SCL database. Patients were excluded if SARS-CoV2 PCR results were not available in the Mayo Clinic electronic medical record (EMR). DIC profile components include prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen and D-dimer. Reflex SFMC is performed if D-dimer is elevated. Data abstracted from EMR included results of laboratory tests, date of COVID-19 symptom onset, date of SARS-CoV2 PCR positivity, and death within 30 days of hospital admission. The ISTH DIC score was calculated and patients were labeled as overt DIC or non-overt DIC based off of ISTH DIC score 5. Results: 35 patients (19 female), median age 59 years (28-91) met our study criteria DIC profiles were obtained 6.5 (1-37) days after COVID-19 symptom onset (n=33) with 28 obtained within 14 days of symptom onset. Time to DIC profile from SARS-CoV2 PCR testing was 4 (0-37) days (n=35) with 31 having testing completed within 14 days of PCR positivity. 8 patients were intubated during hospitalization and of the remaining 27, 67% required supplemental oxygen. 21/35 (60%) patients had an elevated fibrinogen (526.5 mg/dL (201-800)) while 19/35 (54%) had a prolonged PT (12.8 seconds (10.1-99.6) and 5/35 (14%) had a prolonged APTT (31 seconds (24-68)). 17 patients with prolonged PT and 3 patients with prolonged APTT had factor activity assays performed (Figure 1A). 9/35 (25%) had thrombocytopenia (230 x 109/L (12-709) and 27/35 (77%) patients had an elevated D-dimer (895 ng/ml FEU (220- >100,000). D-dimer was higher in males than in females (p: 0.049). Of those with elevated D-dimer only 5/27 (18.5%) had an elevated SFMC (5 mcg/ml (5- >1100) (Figure 1B). 4/35 (11%) patients had ISTH DIC scores  5 and all had score of 5. All of these patients had D-dimer > 2000 ng/ml while only 2 had elevated SFMC however SFMC in both of these patients was < 15 mcg/ml. Of these, one patient with SFMC of 12 mcg/ml had known cirrhosis and the other with an SFMC of 11 mcg/ml had acute decompensation and associated shock liver. This patient also had venous thrombosis 3 days prior to DIC profile and died from complications related to COVID-19 infection. Of the two other patients with high ISTH score and normal SFMC, one had previous chronic thrombocytopenia of < 50 x109/L while the other had concomitant admission for acute and recurrent pancreatitis in the setting of alcoholism with acute intoxication. Six patients died within 30 days of admission and in 2/5 performed SFMC was elevated (Figure1C). Conclusion: Compared to 77% of patients with elevated D-dimers, of those tested only 18.5 % of patients had elevated SFMC. It has been hypothesized that the elevated D-dimer noted in COVID-19 pulmonary infection is a direct consequence of acute lung injury and not overt DIC. Although preliminary, the small percentage of patients with overt DIC by ISTH criteria and normal SFMC in the majority of the current cohort support this hypothesis; however studies in a larger more controlled cohort are needed to confirm these findings.

Design Systematic narrative review. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Primary research studies published in peer-reviewed literature and reporting care for adults with acute dental pain or infection across healthcare settings. Reports not in English language were excluded. STUDY SELECTION: Seven databases (CINAHL Plus, Dentistry and Oral Sciences Source, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched from inception to December 2020. Risk of bias assessment used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for randomised controlled trials and Quality Assessment Tool for Studies of Diverse Design for other study types. OUTCOMES: Narrative synthesis included all outcomes of care for adults with acute dental pain or infection. Excluded were outcomes about pain management to facilitate treatment, prophylaxis of postsurgical pain/infection or traumatic injuries. RESULTS: Searches identified 19 438 records, and 27 studies (dating from 1993 to 2020) were selected for inclusion. Across dental, pharmacy, hospital emergency and rural clinic settings, the studies were undertaken in high-income (n=20) and low/middle-income (n=7) countries. Two clinical outcome categories were identified: signs and symptoms of pain/infection and complications following treatment (including adverse drug reactions and reattendance for the same problem). Patient-reported outcomes included satisfaction with the care. Data collection methods included patient diaries, interviews and in-person reviews. DISCUSSION: A heterogeneous range of study types and qualities were included: one study, published in 1947, was excluded only due to lacking outcome details. Studies from dentistry reported just clinical outcomes; across wider healthcare more outcomes were included. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of clinical and patient-reported outcomes are recommended to evaluate care for adults with acute dental pain or infection. Further research is recommended to develop core outcomes aligned with the international consensus on oral health outcomes.

Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout. METHODS: In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95% in those aged 80 years and older, 85% in those aged 50-79 years, and 75% in those aged 18-49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0% to 85%. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024. FINDINGS: We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 158 (95% credible intervals [CI] 136-184) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95% CI 1400-55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85% of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800-173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60% of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60% protection against infection, 483% (95% CI 481-485) and 160% (157-163) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively. INTERPRETATION: For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

For counselors, the concept measures their belief in their ability to conduct counseling sessions. However, it is an understudied area. As Bandura states, self-efficacy and its sources should be investigated and measured within its domain, which in this case is school counseling. This study examined the impact on school counselors self-efficacy and job satisfaction of the personal and environmental factors: (a) mastery experience, (b) social persuasion, (c) vicarious learning, (d) physiological and affective state, (e) the access to training, and (f) perceived supervisor support of training. The cross-sectional study involved 541 Malaysian secondary school counselors nationwide via a random sampling-distributed questionnaire. Results which were analyzed using PLS-SEM, with importance-performance functionality embedded in it, indicated that mastery experience, access to training, and perceived supervisor support of training explained 45.6% variance in counseling self-efficacy and together with counseling self-efficacy, contributed 13.2% variance in job satisfaction among the school counselors. The importance-performance map analysis revealed supervisor support of training as of greatest importance in shaping counseling self-efficacy. Counseling self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between mastery experience, access to training, supervisor support toward training, and job satisfaction Arising from this finding is a proposed theoretical framework in which efficacy information (i.e., mastery experience), environmental determinants (i.e., access to training and supervisor support of training) and cognitive determinant (i.e., counseling self-efficacy) corresponded together congruently and lead to higher job satisfaction. Suggestions are also made for training providers, content developers, and policymakers to include these factors in professional development training and continuous education, to sustain the wellbeing of school counselors.","output":"Malaysian School Counselors Self-Efficacy: The Key Roles of Supervisor Support for Training, Mastery Experience, and Access to Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate three aspects of the importance of nodes with respect to susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) disease dynamics: influence maximization (the expected outbreak size given a set of seed nodes), the effect of vaccination (how much deleting nodes would reduce the expected outbreak size), and sentinel surveillance (how early an outbreak could be detected with sensors at a set of nodes).

We aimed to determine the impact of SARS-CoV2 on the monthly incidence rates and type of pacemaker (PM) and implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implantations in Catalonia before and after the declaration of the state of alarm in Spain on 14 March 2020. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on new CIED implantations for 2017C20 were prospectively collected by nine hospitals in Catalonia. A mixed model with random intercepts corrected for time was used to estimate the change in monthly CIED implantations. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, an absolute decrease of 56.5% was observed (54.7% in PM and 63.7% in ICD) in CIED implantation rates. Total CIED implantations for 2017C19 and January and February 2020 was 250/month (>195 PM and >55 ICD), decreasing to 207 (161 PM and 46 ICD) in March and 131 (108 PM and 23 ICD) in April 2020. In April 2020, there was a significant fall of 185.25 CIED implantations compared to 2018 [95% confidence interval (CI) 129.6C240.9; P < 0.001] and of 188 CIED compared to 2019 (95% CI 132.3C243.7; P < 0.001).

DESIGN: A prospective case-control study determined by admittance to the hospital based on bed availability. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen patients with COVID-19 infection (laboratory confirmed) severe pneumonia admitted to hospital between 20th March and 19th April 2020. Patients admitted to the hospital during the study period were assigned to different beds based on bed availability. Depending on the bed the patient was admitted, the treatment was ozone autohemotherapy or standard treatment. Patients in the case group received ozonated blood twice daily starting on the day of admission for a median of four days. Each treatment involved administration of 200 mL autologous whole blood enriched with 200 mL of oxygen-ozone mixture with a 40 g/mL ozone concentration. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was time from hospital admission to clinical improvement. RESULTS: Nine patients (50%) received ozonated autohemotherapy beginning on the day of admission. Ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement (median [IQR]), 7 days [6C10] vs 28 days [8C31], p = 0.04) and better outcomes at 14-days (88.8% vs 33.3%, p = 0.01).

Therapeutic antibodies specific to cancer cell antigens are used to treat various malignancies. NK cells in turn kill antibody-bound tumor cells through a process known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The ADCC response of NK cells can be modulated by changes in the antibody or Fc receptor. In this review, we detail the functions of Fc receptors in human NK cells and expand upon current research illustrating how engineering monoclonal antibodies and Fc receptors enhance NK cell-mediated ADCC for the treatment of cancer. ABSTRACT: Tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the most widely used and characterized immunotherapy for hematologic and solid tumors. The significance of this therapy is their direct and indirect effects on tumor cells, facilitated by the antibodys antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and fragment crystallizable region (Fc region), respectively. The Fab can modulate the function of cell surface markers on tumor cells in an agonistic or antagonistic manner, whereas the Fc region can be recognized by an Fc receptor (FcR) on leukocytes through which various effector functions, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), can be elicited. This process is a key cytolytic mechanism of natural killer (NK) cells. These innate lymphocytes in the human body recognize tumor-bound antibodies exclusively by the IgG Fc receptor CD16A (FcRIIIA). Two allelic versions of CD16A bind IgG with either lower or higher affinity. Cancer patients homozygous for the higher affinity allele of CD16A have been reported to respond significantly better to mAb therapies for various malignancies. These studies revealed that mAb therapy efficacy positively correlates with higher affinity binding to CD16A. Approaches to enhance tumor antigen targeting by NK cells by modifying the Fc portion of antibodies or the FcR on NK cells are the focus of this review.","output":"Engineering Anti-Tumor Monoclonal Antibodies and Fc Receptors to Enhance ADCC by Human NK Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention) The objectives are as follows: To assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 and development of COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach","output":"Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cohort study examines trends in suicide rates in Japan from 2009 to 2021, including the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Trends in Suicide in Japan Following the 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The purpose of this descriptive study was to understand the instructional methods, quality, and challenges in online instruction as industrial engineering instructors in Indonesia transitioned from face-to-face to fully online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The situation is affecting not only uro-oncological patients but also patients with benign and disabling conditions who are suffering delays in medical attention that impact their quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To propose, based on expert advice and current evidence where available, a strategy to reorganize female and functional urological (FFU) activity (diagnosis and treatment). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The present document is based on a narrative review of the limited data available in the urological literature on SARS-Cov-2 and the experience of FFU experts from several countries around the world. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: In all the treatment schemes proposed in the literature on the COVID-19 pandemic, FFU surgery is not adequately covered and usually grouped into the category that is not urgent or can be delayed, but in a sustained pandemic scenario there are cases that cannot be delayed that should be considered for surgery as a priority. The aim of this document is to provide a detailed management plan for noninvasive and invasive FFU consultations, investigations, and operations. A classification of FFU surgical activity by indication and urgency is proposed, as well as recommendations adopted from the literature for good surgical practice and by surgical approach in FFU in the COVID-19 era. CONCLUSIONS: Functional, benign, and pelvic floor conditions have often been considered suitable for delay in challenging times. The long-term implications of this reduction in functional urology clinical activity are currently unknown. This document will help functional urology departments to reorganize their activity to best serve their patients.

Before infection, PLCs elicited astrocytic maturation and production of basement membrane components, features attributed to pericyte functions in vivo. While traditional cortical organoids showed little evidence of infection, PLCs within cortical organoids served as viral 'replication hubs', with virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I interferon transcriptional responses. Therefore, PLC-containing cortical organoids (PCCOs) represent a new 'assembloid' model that supports astrocytic maturation as well as SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in neural tissue; thus, PCCOs serve as an experimental model for neural infection.","output":"A human three-dimensional neural-perivascular 'assembloid' promotes astrocytic development and enables modeling of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Few definitive guidelines exist for rigorous large-scale prospective evaluation of nonrandomized programs and policies that require longitudinal primary data collection. In Veterans Affairs (VA) we identified a need to understand the impact of a geriatrics primary care model (referred to as GeriPACT); however, randomization of patients to GeriPACT vs. a traditional PACT was not feasible because GeriPACT has been rolled out nationally, and the decision to transition from PACT to GeriPACT is made jointly by a patient and provider. We describe our study design used to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of GeriPACT compared to a traditional primary care model (referred to as PACT) on patient experience and quality of care metrics. METHODS: We used prospective matching to guide enrollment of GeriPACT-PACT patient dyads across 57 VA Medical Centers. First, we identified matches based an array of administratively derived characteristics using a combination of coarsened exact and distance function matching on 11 identified key variables that may function as confounders. Once a GeriPACT patient was enrolled, matched PACT patients were then contacted for recruitment using pre-assigned priority categories based on the distance function; if eligible and consented, patients were enrolled and followed with telephone surveys for 18 months. RESULTS: We successfully enrolled 275 matched dyads in near real-time, with a median time of 7 days between enrolling a GeriPACT patient and a closely matched PACT patient. Standardized mean differences of < 0.2 among nearly all baseline variables indicates excellent baseline covariate balance. Exceptional balance on survey-collected baseline covariates not available at the time of matching suggests our procedure successfully controlled many known, but administratively unobserved, drivers of entrance to GeriPACT. CONCLUSIONS: We present an important process to prospectively evaluate the effects of different treatments when randomization is infeasible and provide guidance to researchers who may be interested in implementing a similar approach.

Steroid 5-alpha reductases (SRD5As) increase DHT production in the scalp hair follicles, resulting in hair thinning and hair loss. Even though synthetic SRD5A inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) are effective in treating AGA, they cause adverse effects. This has led to an increased interest in alternative treatments from natural sources. The value of Thai rice bran has increased because several of its components may have use in AGA treatment. This study aimed to compare the suppression of the expression of SRD5A genes (type 1C3) exerted by several Thai rice bran extracts and investigate the interactional mechanism of their components towards SRD5A type 2. Tubtim Chumphae rice bran (TRB) had the highest sum of overall bioactive compounds. Among all extracts, the expression of SRD5A genes was suppressed by TRB as well as finasteride. In silico simulation showed that -tocopherol had the greatest interaction with SRD5A type 2. Our findings identified -tocopherol as the key bioactive in TRB; it could be developed as an anti-hair loss product. ABSTRACT: Steroid 5-alpha reductases (SRD5As) are responsible for the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a potent androgen, which is the aetiologic factor of androgenetic alopecia. This study aimed to compare the SRD5A gene expression suppression activity exerted by Thai rice bran extracts and their components and investigate the interactional mechanism between bioactive compounds and SRD5A2 using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Bran of Oryza sativa cv. Tubtim Chumphae (TRB), Yamuechaebia Morchor (YRB), Riceberry (RRB), and Malinil Surin (MRB), all rice milling by-products, was solvent-extracted. The ethanolic extract of TRB had the highest sum of overall bioactive compounds (-oryzanol; -, -, and -tocopherol; phenolics; and flavonoids). Among all extracts, TRB greatly downregulated the expression of SRD5A1, SRD5A2, and SRD5A3; there were no significant differences between TRB and finasteride regarding SRD5A suppression. The linear relationship and principal component analysis supported that the -tocopherol content was correlated with the SRD5A suppression exerted by TRB. Furthermore, MD simulation demonstrated that -tocopherol had the highest binding affinity towards SRD5A2 by interacting with residues Phe118 and Trp201. Our findings indicate that -tocopherol effectively downregulates the expression of SRD5A genes and inhibits SRD5A2 activity, actions that are comparable to standard finasteride. TRB, a source of -tocopherol, could be developed as an anti-hair loss product.","output":"Effects on Steroid 5-Alpha Reductase Gene Expression of Thai Rice Bran Extracts and Molecular Dynamics Study on SRD5A2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 27 July, Journal of Wound Care and the University of Huddersfield streamed the first of 10 live webinars on their Wounds Week channel (www.woundsweek.com).

Drug repurposing can be formulated as a recommender system that recommends novel indications for available drugs based on known drug-disease associations. This article presents a method based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF-DR) to predict the drug-related candidate disease indications. This work proposes a recommender system-based method for drug repurposing to predict novel drug indications by integrating drug and diseases related data sources. For this purpose, this framework first integrates two types of disease similarities, the associations between drugs and diseases, and the various similarities between drugs from different views to make a heterogeneous drugCdisease interaction network. Then, an improved non-negative matrix factorization-based method is proposed to complete the drugCdisease adjacency matrix with predicted scores for unknown drugCdisease pairs. RESULTS: The comprehensive experimental results show that NMF-DR achieves superior prediction performance when compared with several existing methods for drugCdisease association prediction. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The program is available at https://github.com/sshaghayeghs/NMF-DR.

The respondents were from Norway, the UK, the USA and Australia. The mental health of those working and not working were analysed using t tests and socio-demographics were compared using one-way analysis of variance. Respondents who were working were significantly more likely to experience better mental health, were younger, report higher levels of education, and significantly less likely to worry about their own situation, health or financial situation than respondents who were not employed. Respondents who were retired reported better mental health than respondents who were not working for other reasons (laid off/dismissed, receiving benefits, studying, other). These findings raise the importance for social workers and other health service providers to monitor the overall mental health of individuals especially when social distancing protocols are in place and as countries begin to recover from the pandemic.","output":"Cross-National Study of Mental Health and Employment Status Nine Months Post Social Distancing Implementation Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES COVID-19 is associated with a prothrombotic state and elevated risk of thromboembolism. This study assesses the risk of thromboembolic events and their impact on hospitalization of COVID-19 inpatients. Image, table 1 Image, table 1 Image, table 1 METHODS Retrospective review of all COVID-19 inpatients (18 years old) at a single academic institution from March 15, 2020 - July 1, 2020 was performed. Patient data included demographics, comorbidities, hospital admission type, thromboembolic events, laboratory values, use of anticoagulants/antiplatelets, hospital length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS Within 826 COVID-19 inpatients (56% male, 44% female) identified, 87 patients (10.5%) had 98 thromboembolic events. (Table 1). Hypertension, CAD, and CLTI were associated with increased incidence of thromboembolism (p <0.05). Non-white patients had higher incidence of thromboembolism [OR (CI): 2.43 (1.279, 4.616), p=0.007]. As D-dimer increased by 500 unit increments, the odds of developing a thromboembolic event increased by 5.2% [OR (CI): 1.052 (1.027, 1.077), p<0.001]. (Table 2). Patients with thromboembolism had higher antiplatelet/anticoagulants usage (p <.05), longer hospital LOS (Mean: 17.8 vs 9.0, p <0.001), higher ICU admission (63% vs 33%, p<0.001), and higher in-hospital mortality (28% vs 16%, p =0.006). (Table 3). CONCLUSIONS Increased D-dimer, CAD, and CLTI are associated with elevated risk of thromboembolic events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients while smoking status had no association. Non-white patients had increased risk of thromboembolism. Patients with thromboembolism had higher antiplatelet/anticoagulant usage, longer LOS, higher ICU admissions, and increased mortality.

Gaps in the process result in missed opportunities to prevent COVID-19. Objective: To quantify proportions of cases and their contacts reached by public health authorities and the amount of time needed to reach them and to compare the risk of a positive COVID-19 test result between contacts and the general public during 4-week assessment periods. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study took place at 13 health departments and 1 Indian Health Service Unit in 11 states and 1 tribal nation. Participants included all individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and their named contacts. Local COVID-19 surveillance data were used to determine the numbers of persons reported to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were interviewed and named contacts between June and October 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: For contacts, the numbers who were identified, notified of their exposure, and agreed to monitoring were calculated. The median time from index case specimen collection to contact notification was calculated, as were numbers of named contacts subsequently notified of their exposure and monitored. The prevalence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test among named and tested contacts was compared with that jurisdiction's general population during the same 4 weeks. Results: The total number of cases reported was 74a?185. Of these, 43a?931 (59%) were interviewed, and 24a?705 (33%) named any contacts. Among the 74a?839 named contacts, 53a?314 (71%) were notified of their exposure, and 34a?345 (46%) agreed to monitoring. A mean of 0.7 contacts were reached by telephone by public health authorities, and only 0.5 contacts per case were monitored. In general, health departments reporting large case counts during the assessment (&#8805;5000) conducted smaller proportions of case interviews and contact notifications. In 9 locations, the median time from specimen collection to contact notification was 6 days or less. In 6 of 8 locations with population comparison data, positive test prevalence was higher among named contacts than the general population. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of US local COVID-19 surveillance data, testing named contacts was a high-yield activity for case finding. However, this assessment suggests that contact tracing had suboptimal impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, largely because 2 of 3 cases were either not reached for interview or named no contacts when interviewed. These findings are relevant to decisions regarding the allocation of public health resources among the various prevention strategies and for the prioritization of case investigations and contact tracing efforts.","output":"COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing in the US, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The foundational principle of Islam is Rahman and the beloved Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him) has been sent as rahmatan Lil Alamin, mercy to all mankind.

An illustration of the usefulness of visualizing amino acid substitutions in a 3D physicochemical space is shown using data collected from the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. The substitutions most responsible for antibody escape are almost always inaccessible via single nucleotide mutation, and also change multiple properties concurrently.

The aim of this project was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID- 19 infection among pediatric patients undergoing ambulatory procedures and surgeries, overall and for Pediatric Gastroenterology (GI) cases specifically. Methods: A retrospective chart review identified pediatric patients (21 years) who underwent ambulatory pre-operative COVID-19 testing between April 1, 2020-March 31, 2021. Demographic and health-related data was collected to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients scheduled for GI procedures and other ambulatory surgeries. We compared the proportion of patients who tested positive by age group, co-morbid condition, and surgical specialty. We also compared pediatric case rates to Ohio case rates. The study was IRB approved. Results: 4,663 asymptomatic pediatric patients underwent pre-operative COVID-19 testing by PCR and 81 patients were identified as positive (1.73%). In COVID-19 positive patients, 56% were male and 44% were female. Mean age was 12 years and patients 13-18 years were the age group with the highest fraction of positive tests (35%). 11% of patients screened were undergoing a GI-related procedure with a positivity rate of 1.3%. The peak in asymptomatic positives across all procedures occurred in November 2020 (30%), which preceded the peak in COVID-19 cases in Ohio by several weeks. Most prevalent co-morbid condition was asthma (15%) and 8% had inflammatory bowel disease. 5 patients were undergoing chemotherapy and none were on biologic therapy. 94% of cases were deferred. 25% of cases that proceeded required post-operative admission. Conclusion: Asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients were identified before 1.73% of pediatric ambulatory procedures and before 1.3% of GI procedures. These case rates were higher than the concurrent adult case rate at our institution. The higher rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in pre-operative pediatric ambulatory patients may reflect the milder disease in this age group. The peak in pediatric asymptomatic case positivity seemed to predict the subsequent peak case rate in the state of Ohio by a few weeks.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) are a class of immunotherapeutic agents that attack the tumor cells by reinvigorating the suppressed immune system. However, the unbridled T-cell activity disrupts the immune homeostasis and induces a unique spectrum of side effects called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in a significant proportion of patients. These irAEs are distinct from the side effects produced by traditional chemotherapeutic agents. Although majority of irAEs are manageable with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents, life-threatening and fatal events have been reported. In the absence of predictive biomarkers to identify patients at risk for irAEs and standardized approach to detect, report, and treat irAEs, management of irAEs has been challenging to the patients, caregivers and the healthcare providers alike. With increasing use of ICPis for treatment of various cancers, the incidence of irAEs will undoubtedly increase. There is a compelling need to develop measures to effectively manage irAEs, both in the community settings and in cancer centers alike. To this end, in this paper, we propose several strategies, such as providing patient education, harmonizing irAE management guidelines, standardizing reporting of irAEs, optimizing the choice of immunosuppressive agents, conducting preclinical, clinical and translational studies to better understand irAEs, including high-risk patients, incorporating diagnostic tools to personalize irAE management using wireless technology and digital health, providing a platform to hear the missing patients voice, and sharing evolving data to improve the management of irAEs.","output":"Strategies for improving the management of immune-related adverse events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School closure was the only main control measure that Japan took into action from late February to late March in 2020.

In some jurisdictions, over 10% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been found among healthcare workers. Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) may increase the risk of nosocomial transmission, exacerbated by present global shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Improved methods for mitigating risk during AGMPs are therefore urgently needed. Methods The Aerosol Containment Enclosure (ACE) was constructed from acrylic with silicone gaskets for arm port seals and completed with a thin plastic sheet. Hospital wall suction generated negative pressure within the ACE. To evaluate protective capability, differential pressures were recorded under static conditions and during simulated AGMPs. Smoke flow patterns, fluorescence aerosolization, and sodium saccharin aerosolization tests were also conducted. Results Negative pressures of up to -47.7 mmH2O were obtained using the enclosure with two wall suction units (combined outflow of 70 L min-1), with inflow of O2 of 15 L min-1. Negative pressures between -10 and -35 mmH2O were maintained during simulated AGMPs, including oxygen delivery by mask, airway suctioning, bag-mask manual ventilation and endotracheal intubation of a potential COVID-19 patient. The ACE effectively contained smoke, fluorescein aerosol, and sodium saccharin aerosol within the enclosure during use. Conclusions The ACE is capable of maintaining negative pressure during simulated AGMPs. In all cases, containment was improved relative to an identical enclosure with non-occluded ports at ambient pressure. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the use of such a device may assist in reducing nosocomial infections among healthcare providers.","output":"A Rapidly Deployable Negative Pressure Enclosure for Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Actuality One of the most widely discussed treatments for patients with COVID-19, especially at the beginning of the epidemy, was the use of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The first small non-randomized trials showed the ability of HCQ and its combination with azithromycin to accelerate the elimination of the virus and ease the acute phase of the disease. Later, large, randomized trials did not confirm it (RECOVERY, SOLIDARITY). This study is a case-control study in which we compared patients who received and did not receive HCQ.Material and Methods 103 patients (25 in the HCQ treatment group and 78 in the control group) with confirmed COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was detected in 26 of 73 in the control group (35.6%) and in 10 of 25 (40%) in the HCQ group) and in the rest - a typical picture of viral pneumonia on multislice computed tomography [MSCT]) were included in the analysis. The severity of lung damage was limited to stages I-II, the CRP level should not exceed 60 mg/dL, and oxygen saturation in the air within 92-98%. We planned to analysis the duration of treatment of patients in the hospital, the days until the normalization of body temperature, the number of points according to the original SHOCS-COVID integral scale, and changes in its components (C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and the percentage of lung damage according to MSCT).Results Analysis for the whole group revealed a statistically significant increase in the time to normalization of body temperature from 4 to 7 days (by 3 days, p&lt;0.001), and the duration of hospitalization from 9.4 to 11.8 days (by 2.4 days, p=0.002) when using HCQ in comparison with control. Given the incomplete balance of the groups, the main analysis included 46 patients who were matched by propensity score matching. The trend towards similar dynamics continued. HCQ treatment slowed down the time to normalization of body temperature by 1.8 days (p=0.074) and lengthened the hospitalization time by 2.1 days (p=0.042). The decrease in scores on the SHOCS -COVID scale was statistically significant in both groups, and there were no differences between them (delta - 3.00 (2.90) in the HCQ group and - 2.69 (1.55) in control, p=0.718). At the same time, in the control group, the CRP level returned to normal (4.06 mg/dl), and with the use of GC, it decreased but remained above the norm (6.21 mg/dl, p=0.05). Side effects requiring discontinuation of treatment were reported in 3 patients in the HCQ group and none in the control group.Conclusion We have not identified any positive properties of HCQ and its ability to influence the severity of COVID-19. This antimalarial agent slows down the normalization of the body's inflammatory response and lengthens the time spent in the hospital. HCQ should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19): a case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since SARS-CoV-2 started spreading in Europe in early 2020, there has been a strong call for technical solutions to combat or contain the pandemic, with contact tracing apps at the heart of the debates.

A DPIA is a structured risk analysis that identifies and evaluates possible consequences of data processing relevant to fundamental rights and describes the measures envisaged to address these risks or expresses the inability to do so. Based on the Standard Data Protection Model (SDM), we present a scientific DPIA which thoroughly examines three published contact tracing app designs that are considered to be the most\\"privacy-friendly\\": PEPP-PT, DP-3T and a concept summarized by Chaos Computer Club member Linus Neumann, all of which process personal health data. The DPIA starts with an analysis of the processing context and some expected use cases. Then, the processing activities are described by defining a realistic processing purpose. This is followed by the legal assessment and threshold analysis. Finally, we analyse the weak points, the risks and determine appropriate protective measures. We show that even decentralized implementations involve numerous serious weaknesses and risks. Legally, consent is unfit as legal ground hence data must be processed based on a law. We also found that measures to realize the rights of data subjects and affected people are not sufficient. Last but not least, we show that anonymization must be understood as a continuous process, which aims at separating the personal reference and is based on a mix of legal, organizational and technical measures.

Early diagnosis of unfavorable changes in the condition of skeletal muscles and the implementation of therapeutic methods may reduce the risk of functional limitations in the elderly. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between the bioelectrical impedance phase angle and the occurrence of pre-sarcopenia in people aged 50 and above. Methods: 1567 people aged 50C87 were examined. Anthropometric as well as muscle strength and walking speed measurements were performed. Using bioelectrical impedance analysis, the phase angle was measured and the appendicular skeletal muscle mass was estimated. The contribution of the phase angle in explaining the probability of the occurrence of pre-sarcopenia was verified by multivariate logistic regression. Results: Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 12 people (0.8%) and pre-sarcopenia in 276 people (17.6%). Significantly lower impedance phase angle and muscle functional quality were found in people with confirmed pre-sarcopenia compared to people without sarcopenia. The relative differences for the phase angle were greater than for the indicator of muscle functional quality. Significant logit models were obtained for the probability of occurrence of pre-sarcopenia, in which the strongest predictor was the phase angle, regardless of the type and number of covariates. The cut-off point of the phase angle for identification of pre-sarcopenia was 5.42 in men and 4.76 in women. Conclusion: The strong association between the risk of pre-sarcopenia and the phase angle, which can be easily and quickly assessed by bio-impedance analysis, suggests the necessity to include this parameter in routine geriatric evaluation in order to identify the risk of sarcopenia.","output":"The Use of the Bioelectrical Impedance Phase Angle to Assess the Risk of Sarcopenia in People Aged 50 and above in Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The combination of two active scaffolds into one molecule represents a proven approach in drug design to overcome microbial drug resistance.

INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous hydration therapy with normal saline successfully eliminated his hyperviscosity associated symptoms. In view of socio-economic reasons, this patient refused surgical evaluation and further medical interventions. OUTCOMES: During 18-month follow up, he received no drug except for regular water intake. Fortunately, his life quality was satisfactory, and no other symptoms emerged except for mild numbness of limbs.

METHODS: In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled ambulatory outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by a molecular method who received hydroxychloroquine. The patients were divided into low- and moderate-risk groups based on the Tisdale risk score for drug-associated QT prolongation, and the QT interval was corrected for heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc). The QTc interval was measured by electrocardiography both pretreatment (QTc1) and 4 h after the administration of hydroxychloroquine (QTc2). The difference between the QTc1 and QTc2 intervals was defined as the &#916;QTc. The QTc1 and QTc2 intervals and &#916;QTc values were compared between the two risk groups. RESULTS: The median and interquartile range (IQR) age of the patients was 47.0 (36.2-62) years, and there were 78 men and 74 women. The median (IQR) QTc1 interval lengthened from 425.0 (407.2-425.0) to 430.0 (QTc2; 412.0-443.0) milliseconds (ms). However, this was not considered an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QTc interval requiring drug discontinuation, because none of the patients had a &#916;QTc of >60 ms or a QTc2 of >500 ms. Moreover, the median (quartiles; minimum-maximum) &#916;QTc value was higher in patients in the moderate-risk group than those in the low-risk group (10.0 [-4.0-18.0; -75.0-51.0] vs. 7.0 [-10.5-23.5; -53.0-59.0 ms]) (p = 0.996). Clinical improvement was noted in 91.4% of the patients, the exceptions being 13 patients who presented with non-serious adverse drug reactions or who had severe COVID-19 and were hospitalized. Adverse effects related to hydroxychloroquine were non-serious and occurred in 52.8% (n = 80) of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that hydroxychloroquine is safe for COVID-19 and not associated with a risk of ventricular arrhythmia due to drug-induced QTc interval prolongation. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine was well tolerated, and there were no drug-related non-serious adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients who were stable and did not require hospitalization.","output":"Safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in 152 outpatients with confirmed COVID-19: A pilot observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective data sharing is key to accelerating research that will improve the precision of diagnoses, efficacy of treatments and long-term survival of pediatric cancer and other childhood catastrophic diseases.

This \\"hardwired\\" policy endogeneity creates empirical challenges in credibly isolating the causal effect of lifting a statewide SIPO on COVID-19-related health. To break this simultaneity problem, the current study exploits a unique natural experiment generated by a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision.

We capitalize on this sudden, dramatic, and largely unanticipated termination of a statewide SIPO to estimate its effect on social distancing and COVID-19 case growth. Using a synthetic control design, we find no evidence that the repeal of the state SIPO impacted social distancing, COVID-19 cases, or COVID-19-related mortality during the fortnight following enactment. Estimated effects were economically small and nowhere near statistically different from zero.

We apply a Wishart mixture model so as to cluster individuals while modelling the corresponding autocovariance matrices at the same time. The fitted Wishart scale matrices map to cluster-level autoregressive coefficients through the Yule-Walker equations, fitting robust parsimonious autoregressive mixture models. This approach is able to discern differences in underlying autocorrelation variation of time series in settings with large heterogeneous datasets.

Although many acute care hospitals' emergency response plans include some provision for delaying or cancelling elective procedures in the event of an inpatient surge, no standardized method for implementing and quantifying the impact of this strategy exists in the literature. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to prospectively emergency plan for implementing a strategy of delaying procedures and quantifying the potential impact of this strategy on creating hospital bed capacity. METHODS This is a pilot study. A categorization methodology was devised and applied retrospectively to all scheduled procedures during four one-week periods chosen by convenience. The categorization scheme grouped procedures into four categories: (A) procedures with no impact on inpatient capacity; (B) procedures that could be delayed indefinitely; (C) procedures that could be delayed by one week; and (D) procedures that could not be delayed. The categorization scheme was applied by two research assistants and an emergency medicine resident. All three raters categorized the first 100 cases to allow for calculation of inter-rater reliability. Maximal hospital bed capacity was defined as the 95th percentile weekday occupancy, as this is more representative of functional bed capacity than is the number of licensed beds. The main outcome was the number of hospital beds that could be created by postponing procedures in categories B and C. RESULTS Maximal hospital bed capacity was 816 beds. Mean occupancy during weekdays was 759 versus 694 on weekends. By postponing Group B and C procedures, a mean of 60 beds (51 general medical/surgical and nine intensive care unit (ICU)) could be created on weekdays, and four beds (three general medical/surgical and one ICU) on weekends. This represents 7.3% and 0.49% of maximal hospital bed capacity and ICU capacity, respectively. In the event that sustained surge is needed, delaying all category B and C procedures for one week would lead to the generation of 1,235 hospital-bed days. Inter-rater reliability was high (kappa = 0.74) indicating good agreement between all three raters. CONCLUSIONS For the institution studied, the strategy of delaying scheduled procedures could generate inpatient capacity with maximal impact during weekdays and little impact on weekends.

In this study, we evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the rates of PSD and PSA. METHODS: All stroke admissions to two hospitals in Saudi Arabia during two months were prospectively evaluated for PSD and PSA. NIHSS and serum TSH assessed on admission. PSD and PSA were evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Post-stroke disability was assessed by mRS, while social support assessed by Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). RESULTS: Among 50 participants (28 males), clinically significant PSD was found in 36%, while PSA in 32%. PSD associated with higher NIHSS (P < 0.001); lower MSPSS (P = 0.003); higher mRS (P = 0.001); and discontinuation of rehabilitation (P = 0.02). PSA was associated with higher TSH (P = 0.01); lower MSPSS (Pa?=a?0.03); while discontinuation of rehabilitation was related to less PSA (P = 0.034). Multivariate analysis showed that NIHSS (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 742-3.37; P = 0.01); and MSPSS score (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47-0.94; P = 0.002) were associated with PSD; while PSA was related to TSH level (OR: 8.32, 95% CI:1.42-47.23; P = 0.02), and discontinuation of rehabilitation (OR: -0.96, 95% CI: -1.90-0.02; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our research shows that the rise in PSD is related to stroke severity and this has not changed significantly during the pandemic; however, PSA showed a noticeable peak.

Current methods for pathogen detection and surveillance are usually dependent on prior knowledge of the etiologic agents involved. Hence, efficient approaches are required for screening wild mosquito populations to detect known and unknown pathogens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we explored the use of Next Generation Sequencing to identify viral agents in wild-caught mosquitoes. We extracted total RNA from different mosquito species from South China. Small 18C30 bp length RNA molecules were purified, reverse-transcribed into cDNA and sequenced using Illumina GAIIx instrumentation. Bioinformatic analyses to identify putative viral agents were conducted and the results confirmed by PCR. We identified a non-enveloped single-stranded DNA densovirus in the wild-caught Culex pipiens molestus mosquitoes. The majority of the viral transcripts (.>80% of the region) were covered by the small viral RNAs, with a few peaks of very high coverage obtained. The +/? strand sequence ratio of the small RNAs was approximately 71, indicating that the molecules were mainly derived from the viral RNA transcripts. The small viral RNAs overlapped, enabling contig assembly of the viral genome sequence. We identified some small RNAs in the reverse repeat regions of the viral 5- and 3 -untranslated regions where no transcripts were expected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate for the first time that high throughput sequencing of small RNA is feasible for identifying viral agents in wild-caught mosquitoes. Our results show that it is possible to detect DNA viruses by sequencing the small RNAs obtained from insects, although the underlying mechanism of small viral RNA biogenesis is unclear. Our data and those of other researchers show that high throughput small RNA sequencing can be used for pathogen surveillance in wild mosquito vectors.","output":"Discovery of DNA Viruses in Wild-Caught Mosquitoes Using Small RNA High throughput Sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as the infectious agent causing the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with dramatic consequences for global human health and economics.

Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term shield immunity at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are no longer shedding virus [8]. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing.

METHODS: This study was performed in 5,626 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between February 1 and April 30, 2020 in South Korea. A Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for predicting 30-day and 60-day survival probabilities and overall mortality, respectively in the train set. Calibration and discrimination were performed to validate the nomograms in the test set. RESULTS: Age  70 years, male, presence of fever and dyspnea at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and diabetes mellitus, cancer, or dementia as underling diseases were significantly related to 30-day and 60-day survival and mortality in COVID-19 patients.

The aim of the present study was to test whether incremental CPAP application in awake CHF patients with SDB, with and without atrial fibrillation, induces acute alterations of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and CO. METHODS During daytime, we applied incremental CPAP (4-10 cmH2O) in 37 stable patients with CHF and SDB. BP and HR were assessed after each 1 cmH2O CPAP increase in 5-min intervals in the entire sample, and CO was assessed at one centre (n = 11). RESULTS Neither mean BP, HR nor CO changed significantly with incremental CPAP (at 0 and 10 cmH2O: 85  2 and 84  2 mm Hg, P = 1.0, 63  1 to 61  2 b.p.m., P = 0.88 and 2.03  0.5 and 2.35  0.8 L/min/m2 , P = 0.92, respectively).

Recent studies showed no difference in overall survival between microwave ablation and resection of liver metastasis with a diameter less than 3 cm. Ablation by percutaneous approach and under CT guidance is considered less invasive than open or laparoscopic resection or ablation. On the other hand, percutaneous ablation by free-hand puncture is considered less accurate, potentially resulting in higher incomplete ablation and local recurrence rates. Moreover, lesions in the upper liver segments 2, 4A, 7, 8 and in segment 1 are very difficult to reach by free-hand approach. Stereotactic navigation technology allows very accurate puncture and can easily reach liver lesions in all liver segments. The start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 resulted in strict capacity limitations in OR facilities, hospital beds, and ICU beds in Belgium. To avoid unacceptable delay in oncologic liver resections, stereotactic microwave ablation was introduced in our hospital. Methods: From March 2020 to January 2021, all patients with resectable colorectal liver metastasis  3 cm were treated by percutaneous ablation under CT guidance with stereotactic technology (Cascination?). Segmental localization of the liver tumors and postoperative complication rate according Clavien-Dindo classification were registered. Incomplete ablation was estimated by MRI 2 months after treatment. We recorded hospital stay, ICU stay and OR time. These data were compared with a cohort of patients treated for colorectal liver metastasis  3cm by liver resection in 2019. Results: 20 patients with 36 liver colorectal metastasis were included. Median age was 69y (52-84y). 21/36 (58%) tumors were localized in liver segments 1, 2, 4A, 7 or 8. 19/20 patients had no complications (Clavien 0 or 1). 1 patient developed biliary stricture and was treated by endoscopic stenting (Clavien 3A). No postoperative mortality was recorded. 3/36 (8,3%) metastasis showed incomplete ablation on MRI. All were treated with re-ablation with complete ablation after 2 months. Hospital stay was 1 overnight stay in 19/20 patients, shortening hospital stay by 3.7 days per patient compared to the resection cohort. No ICU stay was needed after percutaneous ablation. OR time was reduced by 3.6h per patient. Conclusions: The Covid-19 pandemic reduced hospital and ICU capacity drastically. It can lead to a dilemma whether to treat highly affected Covid-19 patients or to perform high-risk oncologic surgery. Introducing percutaneous ablation allows the reduction of hospital stay, ICU stay, OR time, and postoperative complication rate. Not only does this reduce the need for the dilemma of which patient can be treated, but it has the potential to reduce the risk of Covid-19-related morbidity and mortality after high-risk oncologic surgery. Introducing percutaneous ablation with stereotactic navigation allows easy local treatment in any liver segment. Moreover, very precise needle positioning resulted in accurate ablation areas, with low rates of incomplete ablation and need for re-ablation. Finally, this minimally invasive approach offers appropriate local treatment with equivalent oncologic results in resectable colorectal liver metastasis  3 cm.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 76 COVID-19 patients who underwent abdominal CT for abdominal complaints from March 1 to April 15, 2020, in a large urban multihospital Health System were included. Those with positive abdominal CT findings (n = 14) were then excluded, with 62 patients undergoing final analysis (30M/32F; median age 63 years, interquartile range (IQR) 52-75 years, range 30-90 years). Demographic and clinical data were extracted. CT lung base assessment was performed by a cardiothoracic radiologist. Data were compared between discharged and hospitalised patients using Wilcoxon or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: The majority of the population was non-elderly (56.4%, < 65 years) and most (81%) had underlying health conditions. Nineteen percent were discharged and 81% were hospitalised. The most frequent abdominal symptoms were pain (83.9%) and nausea/vomiting/anorexia (46.8%). Lung base CT findings included ground-glass opacities (95.2%) in a multifocal (95.2%) and peripheral (66.1%) distribution. Elevated laboratory values (when available) included C-reactive protein (CRP) (97.3%), D-dimer (79.4%), and ferritin (68.8% of males and 81.8% of females). Older age (p = 0.045), hypertension (p = 0.019), and lower haemoglobin in women (p = 0.042) were more frequent in hospitalised patients. There was no difference in lung base CT findings between discharged and hospitalised patients (p > 0.165). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients can present with abdominal symptoms, especially in non-elderly patients with underlying health conditions. Lung base findings on abdominal CT are consistent with published reports. Radiologists should be aware of atypical presentations of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: a? COVID-19 infected patients can present with acute abdominal symptoms, especially in non-elderly patients with underlying health conditions, and may frequently require hospitalisation (81%). a? There was no difference in lung base CT findings between patients who were discharged and those who were hospitalised. a?

The available evidence is uncertain, and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders. Results: One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids.In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p <0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p <0.001). Conclusions: Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders. A possible advantage of corticosteroid therapy was to reduce Intensive Care Unit admission, which could be useful in reducing pressure on the Intensive Care Units in times of limited resources, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Effect of corticosteroid treatment on 1376 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

This paper pushes this agenda further by acknowledging that the experience of a few developed nations should not be taken as the template for the generalized study of inequality dynamics across time and space. In this paper, we interrogate Piketty's analysis and policy proposals against specificities that are central to understanding the production and reproduction of inequalities within South Africa. We reflect on the South African case, the structure of inequality and its changes since 1994. We review a battery of policy interventions that have been implemented to address inequality in the last 25 years. We emphasize that the long shadow cast by centuries of colonialism and various forms of apartheid strongly affirm Piketty's emphasis on understanding history. But this is both affirmation and critique given the foundational, imbedded impact that this specific legacy has had on post-apartheid society and its policies. Piketty is aware that the levels of inequality in South Africa are so high that this is \\"unknown territory.\\" We map out some of this territory to reveal how these extreme initial wealth and racial inequities inform the reproduction of inequalities in all dimensions and undermine well intentioned policies. We claim that understanding extractive histories, imbedded wealth inequalities, and complex social and political institutions allows us to understand and confront some of the reasons why even in light of progressive policies, many of which are in line with the proposals from Piketty, government interventions have thus far failed to reduce inequality.","output":"Piketty comes to South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WTAP is involved in various pathological and physiological processes, but its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive.

Then, an interactive analysis of genetic profiles and Kaplan-Meier curves was performed to show that WTAP was an independent predictor of survival of HCC patients. Meanwhile, genes co-expressed with WTAP, potential protein-protein interactions, related signaling pathways, and immune cell infiltration were identified. It was found that high WTAP expression correlated with enhanced interactions between cytokines and their receptors, cell cycle, and chemokine signaling pathways, as well as increased immune cell infiltration. At last, WTAP knockdown experiments in vitro indicate that the WTAP silencing inhibited HCC proliferation and aggressiveness.

By binding to the corresponding receptors, IFNs trigger different pathways to block intracellular replication and growth of pathogens and to impede the infection of surrounding cells. Due to their key role in host defense against viral infections, as well as for clinical therapies, the IFN responses and regulation mechanisms are well studied. However, studies of type I IFNs have mainly focused on alpha interferon (IFN-) and IFN- subtypes. Knowledge of IFN- and IFN- is limited. Moreover, most studies are performed in humans or mouse models but not in the original host of zoonotic pathogens. Bats are important reservoirs and transmitters of zoonotic viruses such as lyssaviruses. A few studies have shown an antiviral activity of IFNs in fruit bats. However, the function of type I IFNs against lyssaviruses in bats has not been studied yet. Here, IFN- and IFN- genes from the European serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, were cloned and functionally characterized. E. serotinus IFN- and IFN- genes are intronless and well conserved between microchiropteran species. The promoter regions of both genes contain essential regulatory elements for transcription factors. In vitro studies indicated a strong activation of IFN signaling by recombinant IFN-, whereas IFN- displayed weaker activation. Noticeably, both IFNs inhibit to different extents the replication of different lyssaviruses in susceptible bat cell lines. The present study provides functional data on the innate host defense against lyssaviruses in endangered European bats. IMPORTANCE We describe here for the first time the molecular and functional characterization of two type I interferons (IFN- and -) from European serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus).

Specifically, it described the extent to which the program improved adaptive coping, non-reactivity, resilience and well-being and decreased stress, depression and anxiety symptoms of participants. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a pretestCposttest design with 53 participants. A majority of participants were female (74%) who participated in the program for 6C8 weeks. Scales measuring adaptive coping, non-reactivity, resilience, well-being, stress, depression and anxiety were administered before and after the completion of the modules. Findings: Results revealed significant improvements in adaptive coping particularly seeking emotional and instrumental support, active coping, and religious coping. The results also showed significant improvements in nonreactivity, psychological well-being and resilience and decrease in depression symptoms. Effect size estimates indicate medium effect sizes for well-being and nonreactivity with the other outcomes having small effect sizes. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of this study is the lack of a randomized control trial design and the lack of control for extraneous variables. Future studies using rigorous and longitudinal designs are recommended. Future studies may also examine program implementation factors such as using homogenous groups. Practical implications: In most low-income countries, the provision of mental health and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the lack of mental health professionals, issues of internet connectivity and a lack of resources and access. Online resilience support groups may provide a means to address these challenges by making mental health support more accessible and available. Social implications: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused isolation and a means to bridge this is through peer support groups. This may be especially important in collectivist cultures where social relationships serve as recovery capital.

Most countries have since discontinued the use of chloroquine due to lack of evidence of any benefit and the risk of severe adverse events. The primary aim of this study was to examine if administering chloroquine during COVID-19 imposed an increased risk of ischemic heart injury or heart failure. METHODS: Medical records, laboratory findings, and electrocardiograms of patients with COVID-19 who were treated with 500 mg chloroquine phosphate daily and controls not treated with chloroquine were reviewed retrospectively. Controls were matched in age and severity of disease. RESULTS: We included 20 patients receiving chloroquine (500 mg twice daily) for an average of five days, and 40 controls. The groups were comparable regarding demographics and biochemical analyses including C-reactive protein, thrombocytes, and creatinine. There were no statistically significant differences in cardiac biomarkers or in electrocardiograms. Median troponin T was 10,8 ng/L in the study group and 17.9 ng/L in the control group, whereas median NT-proBNP was 399 ng/L in patients receiving chloroquine and 349 ng/L in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: We found no increased risk of ischemic heart injury or heart failure as a result of administering chloroquine.

We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures implemented. Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33).

The alphavirus small membrane proteins 6K and TF have been reported to be palmitoylated and to positively regulate budding. 6K and TF are isoforms that are identical in their N termini but unique in their C termini due to a -1 ribosomal frameshift during translation. In this study, we used cysteine (Cys) mutants to test differential palmitoylation of the Sindbis virus 6K and TF proteins. We modularly mutated the five Cys residues in the identical N termini of 6K and TF, the four additional Cys residues in TF's unique C terminus, or all nine Cys residues in TF. Using these mutants, we determined that TF palmitoylation occurs primarily in the N terminus. In contrast, 6K is not palmitoylated, even on these shared residues. In the C-terminal Cys mutant, TF protein levels increase both in the cell and in the released virion compared to the wild type. In viruses with the N-terminal Cys residues mutated, TF is much less efficiently localized to the plasma membrane, and it is not incorporated into the virion. The three Cys mutants have minor defects in cell culture growth but a high incidence of abnormal particle morphologies compared to the wild-type virus as determined by transmission electron microscopy. We propose a model where the C terminus of TF modulates the palmitoylation of TF at the N terminus, and palmitoylated TF is preferentially trafficked to the plasma membrane for virus budding. IMPORTANCE Alphaviruses are a reemerging viral cause of arthritogenic disease. Recently, the small 6K and TF proteins of alphaviruses were shown to contribute to virulence in vivo Nevertheless, a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which either protein acts to promote virus infection is missing. The TF protein is a component of budded virions, and optimal levels of TF correlate positively with wild-type-like particle morphology. In this study, we show that the palmitoylation of TF regulates its localization to the plasma membrane, which is the site of alphavirus budding. Mutants in which TF is not palmitoylated display drastically reduced plasma membrane localization, which effectively prevents TF from participating in budding or being incorporated into virus particles. Investigation of the regulation of TF will aid current efforts in the alphavirus field searching for approaches to mitigate alphaviral disease in humans.","output":"Palmitoylation of Sindbis Virus TF Protein Regulates Its Plasma Membrane Localization and Subsequent Incorporation into Virions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective There is a huge technology gap between regions in Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, which is the reality that must be faced However, most of the available researches on innovation efficiency are based on the logic of a given technology level, ignoring the regional technological gap This paper will stand from the perspective of technology gap and re-examine the innovation efficiency of pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in different regions of China and its impact on regional industrial competitiveness Methods We use the DEA-BCC input-oriented model to measure innovation efficiency of 28 provinces from the data of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry The threshold model is constructed, with technology level as the threshold variable, innovation efficiency as the main explanatory variable, and industrial competitiveness as the dependent variable In the threshold model, 28 regions are divided into three technical groups, and further, the impact of innovation efficiency on industrial competitiveness in different groups is analyzed and compared Results According to the empirical research results, an U-shaped efficiency trap has been found in Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, and the areas with medium technical level are at the bottom of the trap The improvement of innovation efficiency does not necessarily promote the improvement of regional industrial competitiveness Only in high-level and low-level technology groups, innovation efficiency has effectively promoted the improvement of industrial competitiveness In addition, the intensity of R&D investment has a similar impact on industrial competitiveness Conclusions The findings suggest that, regions in the efficiency trap should strive to seek opportunities for industrial transformation and focus on the industrial transformation of new technology, new industry and new opportunities, instead of blindly pursuing R&D investment intensity and superstitious innovation efficiency So as to free up innovation resources for high-quality technological innovation in other regions In addition, the Chinese government should make use of its public hospital system to normalize and expand the centralized drug procurement and eliminate the low-quality innovation","output":"Regional technology gap and innovation efficiency trap in Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, with a series of confirmed cases that currently exceeded 300,000 people worldwide and with approximately 14,500 deaths.

Differences in the type and degree of inflammation appear to determine the severity of the disease. Recent reports show an increase in circulating monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) in severe COVID 19, that deplete arginine but are not associated with respiratory complications. Our data shows that differences in the type, function and transcriptome of Granulocytic-MDSC (G-MDSC) may in part explain the severity COVID-19, in particular the association with pulmonary complications. Large infiltrates by Arginase 1+ G-MDSC (Arg+G-MDSC), expressing NOX-1 and NOX-2 (important for production of reactive oxygen species) were found in the lungs of patients who died from COVID-19 complications. Increased circulating Arg+G-MDSC depleted arginine, which impaired T cell receptor and endothelial cell function. Transcriptomic signatures of G-MDSC from patients with different stages of COVID-19, revealed that asymptomatic patients had increased expression of pathways and genes associated with type I interferon (IFN), while patients with severe COVID-19 had increased expression of genes associated with arginase production, and granulocyte degranulation and function. These results suggest that asymptomatic patients develop a protective type I IFN response, while patients with severe COVID-19 have an increased inflammatory response that depletes arginine, impairs T cell and endothelial cell function, and causes extensive pulmonary damage.

Regulatory mechanisms can be triggered to counteract these alterations. However, these mechanisms would occur only when fatigue is induced through voluntary (VOL) contractions and not with electrically stimulated (ES) contractions. Hence the aim was to compare the effects of VOL and ES fatiguing contractions inducing a similar level of strength loss on unipedal postural control (assessed by means of force platform and EMG measurements), maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and central activation ratio (CAR) to characterize the alterations induced by both modalities of fatigue and the associated regulatory mechanisms. Results showed that the VOL exercise induced a significant decrease of the CAR whereas the ES exercise did not, thus illustrating that central fatigue was present only after voluntary contractions. The VOL exercise also induced greater postural disturbances and larger regulatory mechanisms than the ES exercise, which also induced postural regulatory mechanisms. The present study reveals that postural control mechanisms are modulated according to the nature of the fatiguing contractions, likely due integration of specific fatigue signals according to the modality of the contraction. Because of a larger neurophysiological impact of VOL than ES fatiguing contractions due to greater central disturbances, VOL exercise-induced larger regulatory mechanisms. Nevertheless, the presence of regulatory mechanisms with ES contractions clearly underlines the ability of the central nervous system to display an accurate motor control following acute externally induced neuromuscular perturbations.","output":"Voluntary and electrically-induced muscle fatigue differently affect postural control mechanisms in unipedal stance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced universities to conduct online learning, requiring lecturers to create innovative e-learning methods and students to be ready to adapt and show high interest in learning.

Delayed or eliminated care may place patients at risk for adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To identify opportunities for laboratory test stewardship to close potential gaps in care created by the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: The study was a retrospective time series design examining laboratory services received before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large metropolitan health system serving women and children. RESULTS: Laboratory test volumes displayed three distinct patterns: (1) a decrease during State lockdown, followed by near-complete or complete recovery, (2) no change, and (3) a persistent decrease. Tests that diagnose or monitor chronic illness recovered only partially (e.g., HbA1c initially declined 82% (2232 for April 2019 to 452 for April 2020), and there was a sustained 16% drop (28-day average 117 at 8/30/2019 to 98 at 8/30/2020) four months later. Blood lead dropped 39% (2158 for April 2019 to 1314 for April 2020) and remained 20% lower after four months. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has taken a toll on patients, practitioners, and health systems. Laboratory professionals have access to data that can provide insight into clinical practice and identify pandemic-related gaps in care. During the pandemic, the biggest patient threat is underuse, particularly among tests to manage chronic diseases and for traditionally underserved communities and people of color.

Through different inoculation routes, MHV-A59 can provide animal models for encephalitis, hepatitis and pneumonia to explore viral life machinery and virus-host interactions. In viral replication, non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5), also termed main protease (Mpro), plays a dominant role in processing coronavirus-encoded polyproteins and is thus recognized as an ideal target of anti-coronavirus agents. However, no structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro has been reported, and molecular exploration of the catalysis mechanism remains hindered. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro complexed with a Michael acceptor-based inhibitor, N3. Structural analysis revealed that the C of the vinyl group of N3 covalently bound to C145 of the catalytic dyad of Mpro, which irreversibly inactivated cysteine protease activity. The lactam ring of the P1 side chain and the isobutyl group of the P2 side chain, which mimic the conserved residues at the same positions of the substrate, fit well into the S1 and S2 pockets. Through a comparative study with Mpro of other coronaviruses, we observed that the substrate-recognition pocket and enzyme inhibitory mechanism is highly conservative. Altogether, our study provided structural features of MHV-A59 Mpro and indicated that a Michael acceptor inhibitor is an ideal scaffold for antiviral drugs.","output":"The crystal structure of main protease from mouse hepatitis virus A59 in complex with an inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The observed climate changes pose a serious threat not only to humans and the environment, but also to the further development of life on our planet.

Our contention is that the manner in which the sample is obtained has a dramatic effect on CT values. METHODS: For each person suspected of having Covid-19 who arrives at the emergency room, two swabs are taken in succession, one according to CDC guidelines and the other according to Ziv guidelines. The Ziv method sample collection guidelines determine the depth of penetration, the number of rotations of the swab, and their direction. Each double sample was sent for analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of the CT results of the sample to results methods and of the Seegene platform clearly found (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, respectively) that more rigorous sample collection yielded lower CT values.

While surgical treatments, particularly laparoscopic pyloroplasty, have recently gained popularity, they require general anesthesia, advanced skills, and can lead to leaks. Peroral pyloromyotomy is a less invasive alternative; however, this technique is technically demanding and not widely available. We describe a hybrid laparo-endoscopic collaborative approach using a novel gastric access device to allow endoluminal stapled pyloroplasty as an alternative treatment option for gastric outlet obstruction. METHODS Under general anesthesia, six pigs (mean weight 33 kg) underwent endoscopic placement of intragastric ports using a technique similar to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. A 5 mm laparoscope was used for visualization. A functional lumen imagine probe was used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) and diameter of the pylorus before, after, and at 1 week after intervention. Pyloroplasty was performed using a 5 mm articulating laparoscopic stapler. Gastrotomies were closed by endoscopic clips, endoscopic suture, or combination. After 6-8 days, a second evaluation was performed. At the end of the protocol, all animals were euthanized. RESULTS Six pyloroplasties were performed. In all cases, this technique was effective in achieving significant pyloric dilatation. The median pre-pyloroplasty pyloric diameter (D) and cross-sectional area (CSA) were 8 mm (4.9-11.6 mm) and 58.6 mm2 (19-107 mm2), respectively. After the procedure, these values increased to 13.41 mm (9.8-17.6 mm) and 147.7 mm2 (76-244 mm2), respectively (p = 0.0152). No important intraoperative events were observed. Postoperatively, all animals did well, with adequate oral intake and no relevant complications. At follow-up endoscopy, all incisions were healed and the pylorus widely patent.

However, lifelong physical exercise mitigates aging, as observed in endurance-trained middle-aged athletes (EMA). Aim We compared and associated testosterone, interleukin 10 (IL-10), and body fat in EMA and untrained age-matched individuals (UAM). Methods Participants were EMA (n=25; 51.489.49 years) and UAM (n=23; 46.09.37 years). Both groups underwent body composition measurements (evaluated by a skinfold protocol) and blood sampling for IL-10 (assessed through ELISA? kit) and testosterone (assessed with Roche Diagnostics? kit, Mannheim, Germany, by chemiluminescence technique in a third-party laboratory). Results EMA had lower body fat (14.153.82% vs. 23.424.95%; P<0.05), higher testosterone (751.68191.45 ng/dL vs. 493.04175.15 ng/dL; P<0.05), and higher IL-10 (8.001.21 pg/mL vs. 5.891.16 pg/mL; P<0.05) compared to UAM. A significant linear correlation was found between testosterone and IL-10 (r=0.56; P=0.001), whereas significant inverse correlations were observed between body fat and testosterone (r=-0.52; P=0.001) and body fat and IL-10 (r=-0.69; P=0.001). Conclusions EMA had higher levels of IL-10 and testosterone and lower body fat in comparison with UAM. In addition, higher IL-10 was associated with increased levels of circulating testosterone and lower body fat. Relevance for Patients The adoption of endurance training as part of a healthy lifestyle may contribute to decreasing age-related testosterone reduction, besides reducing markers of inflammaging, preventing the occurrence of chronic age-related diseases, and thus contributing to healthy aging. For people who already have chronic diseases, physical exercise can shift the immune system toward a more anti-inflammatory profile and, thus, improve their pathological condition. In both cases, physical exercise can help attenuate the decline in testosterone, decrease body fat, and increase anti-inflammatory levels.","output":"Is lifelong endurance training associated with maintaining levels of testosterone, interleukin-10, and body fat in middle-aged males?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel human illness caused by a previously unrecognized coronavirus (CoV) termed SARS\\\\CoV. There are conflicting reports on the animal reservoir of SARS\\\\CoV. Many of the groups that argue carnivores are the original reservoir of SARS\\\\CoV use a phylogeny to support their argument. However, the phylogenies in these studies often lack outgroup and rooting criteria necessary to determine the origins of SARS\\\\CoV. Recently, SARS\\\\CoV has been isolated from various species of Chiroptera from China (e.g., Rhinolophus sinicus) thus leading to reconsideration of the original reservoir of SARS\\\\CoV. We evaluated the hypothesis that SARS\\\\CoV isolated from Chiroptera are the original zoonotic source for SARS\\\\CoV by sampling SARS\\\\CoV and non\\\\SARS\\\\CoV from diverse hosts including Chiroptera, as well as carnivores, artiodactyls, rodents, birds and humans. Regardless of alignment parameters, optimality criteria, or isolate sampling, the resulting phylogenies clearly show that the SARS\\\\CoV was transmitted to small carnivores well after the epidemic of SARS in humans that began in late 2002. The SARS\\\\CoV isolates from small carnivores in Shenzhen markets form a terminal clade that emerged recently from within the radiation of human SARS\\\\CoV. There is evidence of subsequent exchange of SARS\\\\CoV between humans and carnivores. In addition SARS\\\\CoV was transmitted independently from humans to farmed pigs (Sus scrofa). The position of SARS\\\\CoV isolates from Chiroptera are basal to the SARS\\\\CoV clade isolated from humans and carnivores. Although sequence data indicate that Chiroptera are a good candidate for the original reservoir of SARS\\\\CoV, the structural biology of the spike protein of SARS\\\\CoV isolated from Chiroptera suggests that these viruses are not able to interact with the human variant of the receptor of SARS\\\\CoV, angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In SARS\\\\CoV we study, both visually and statistically, labile genomic fragments and, putative key mutations of the spike protein that may be associated with host shifts.

METHODS: Diagnostic characteristics and outcomes of newly diagnosed French Vasculitis Study Group Registry patients with ANCA-negative, MPO-ANCACpositive or PR3-ANCACpositive GPA satisfying American College of Rheumatology criteria and/or Chapel Hill Conference Consensus Nomenclature were compared. RESULTS: Among 727 GPA, 62 (8.5%) were ANCA-negative, 119 (16.4%) MPO-ANCACpositive and 546 (75.1%) PR3-ANCACpositive. ANCA-negative patients had significantly (p<0.05) more limited disease (17.7% vs 5.8%) and less kidney involvement (35.5% vs 58.9%) than those PR3-ANCACpositive or MPO-ANCACpositive, with comparable relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). MPO-ANCACpositive versus PR3-ANCACpositive and ANCA-negative patients were significantly more often female (52.9% vs 42.1%), older (59.8 vs 51.9 years), with more frequent kidney involvement (65.5% vs 55.2%) and less arthralgias (34.5% vs 55.1%), purpura (8.4% vs 17.1%) or eye involvement (18.5% vs 28.4%); RFS was similar but OS was lower before age adjustment.

METHODS: We included participants who underwent at least 1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 real-time reverse-transcription PCR test between January 1 and June 4, 2020, from the Korean nationwide COVID-19 dataset. Epilepsy was defined according to the presence of diagnostic code in health claims data before the COVID-19 diagnosis. To investigate the association between epilepsy and the susceptibility for or severe complications of COVID-19, a 1:6 ratio propensity score matching (PSM) and logistic regression analysis were performed. Severe complications with COVID-19 infection were defined as a composite of the incidence of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and death within 2 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 212,678 study participants who underwent a COVID-19 test, 3,919 (1.8%) had a history of epilepsy. After PSM, there was no significant difference in COVID-19 PCR positivity according to epilepsy history (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.67-1.11). Of the 7,713 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection, 72 (0.9%) had a history of epilepsy. Among the patients with COVID-19, severe complications occurred in 444 (5.8%) individuals. After PSM, the presence of epilepsy was associated with the occurrence of severe complications after COVID-19 infection (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.04-4.04). Mortality after COVID-19 infection did not differ according to the presence of epilepsy history (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.65-3.70).

Remdesivir has been approved for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in several countries, but its use as monotherapy has not substantially lowered mortality rates. Because agents from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been successfully utilized to treat pandemic and endemic diseases, we designed the current study to identify novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents from TCM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We initially used an antivirus-induced cell death assay to screen a panel of herbal extracts. The inhibition of the viral infection step was investigated through a time-of-drug-addition assay, whereas a plaque reduction assay was carried out to validate the antiviral activity. Direct interaction of the candidate TCM compound with viral particles was assessed using a viral inactivation assay. Finally, the potential synergistic efficacy of remdesivir and the TCM compound was examined with a combination assay. RESULTS: The herbal medicine Perilla leaf extract (PLE, approval number 022427 issued by the Department of Health and Welfare of Taiwan) had EC(50) of 0.12  0.06 mg/mL against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells C with a selectivity index of 40.65. Non-cytotoxic PLE concentrations were capable of blocking viral RNA and protein synthesis. In addition, they significantly decreased virus-induced cytokine release and viral protein/RNA levels in the human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3. PLE inhibited viral replication by inactivating the virion and showed additive-to-synergistic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 when used in combination with remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate for the first time that PLE is capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication by inactivating the virion.

A significant number of patients presenting to our institution either do not have a Primary Care Provider (PCP) or are unable to obtain a timely follow-up with their PCP after ED discharge. The COVID pandemic provided an opportunity to fill this gap by integrating tele-health. We implemented a pilot program called ProPEr Care to provide rapid ED based follow-up in a virtual clinic. This clinic was staffed by either emergency medicine (EM) or dual trained emergency medicine (EM) and internal medicine (IM) physicians with the goal of improving patient outcomes. In addition to addressing medical needs, the clinic physician utilized existing hospital resources such as care coordination and outreach workers to help patients obtain medical insurance and establish long-term primary care. To our knowledge, this program is novel in emergency medicine. Methods: At the time of discharge, the ED physician, at their discretion, can schedule a patient for a ProPEr care clinic visit within the next 7-14 days. An EM or EM-IM trained physician provides the virtual follow-up visit using the Doximity? platform with video or phone call only options. The goal is to provide a bridge while the patient is in the process of establishing a PCP. We contacted patients via a phone call at least 30 days after their ProPEr care clinic visit and asked a series of 10 follow-up questions. Survey questions were developed based on similar studies from other medical specialties. Data was collected and stored in Microsoft Excel?. Basic demographic data was reported from Tableau?, and survey results were calculated in Microsoft Excel?. Results: The majority of our patients felt they were seen quickly (88%) and that the virtual visit was more convenient than a traditional in-person visit (94%). 72% felt that ProPEr care prevented them from coming back to the ED for the same reason. The ProPEr care clinic was able to arrange referrals for all the patients who needed specialty care (100%) and provided electronic prescriptions for all of the patients who needed refills for their long-term medications (100%). Conclusion: A post ED discharge virtual clinic visit provided by an EM or dual trained EM-IM physicians ensures rapid follow-up care, facilitates specialty referrals and potentially reduces return ED visits. It can also help establish long-term primary care. Future studies should evaluate the cost and benefits of a ProPEr care clinic and its impact on hospital readmissions, and health system utilization.

Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective for treating anxiety, its availability is limited by the lack of trained CBT therapists and easily accessible local services. To address the challenges in both recognition and treatment, this study combines systematic anxiety screening in the general population with a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on internet-assisted CBT (ICBT) with telephone coaching. Child, family and intervention-related factors are studied as possible predictors or moderators, together with the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is an open two-parallel group RCT, stratified by sex, that compares ICBT with telephone coaching to an education control. Children aged 10C13 are screened at yearly school healthcare check-ups using five items from the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) Questionnaire. The families of children who screen positive for anxiety are contacted to assess the familys eligibility for the RCT. The inclusion criteria include scoring at least 22 points in the 41-item SCARED Questionnaire. The primary outcome is the SCARED child and parent reports. The secondary outcomes include the impact of anxiety, quality of life, comorbidity, peer relationships, perceptions of school, parental well-being and service use.

Hospital records of children with severe asthma exacerbation admitted to Hat Yai Hospital between 2015 and 2017 were retrospectively collected. Children initially treated with continuous salbutamol 10 mg per hour or intermittent salbutamol 2.5 mg per dose over 1C4 h nebulization were matched one-to-one using the propensity score. Competing risk and risk difference regression was applied to evaluate the proportion of children who succeeded and failed the initial treatment. Restricted mean survival time regression was used to compare the length of stay (LOS) between the two groups. RESULTS: One-hundred and eighty-nine children were included. Of these children, 112 were matched for analysis (56 with continuous and 56 with intermittent nebulization). Children with continuous nebulization experienced a higher proportion of success in nebulization treatment (adjusted difference: 39.5, 95% CI 22.7, 56.3, p < 0.001), with a faster rate of success (adjusted SHR: 2.70, 95% CI 1.73, 4.22, p < 0.001).

SUMMARY: Further studies incorporating prospective molecular profiling are needed to allow stratification of patients at both diagnosis and relapse to further our understanding of how epigenetic modifier mutations evolve over time. The use of tazematostat in combination or upfront in patients with an EZH2 mutation remains unanswered; however, given durable responses, ease of oral administration, and tolerability, it is certainly an attractive option.","output":"Epigenetics of Indolent Lymphoma and How It Drives Novel Therapeutic ApproachesFocus on EZH2-Targeted Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preclinical animal studies provide valuable opportunities to better understand human diseases and contribute to major advances in medicine.

The Hirst-type trap/optical-microscopy system allowed detecting pollen on average over the full bloom season, since whole pollen grains, whose diameter vary within 10C100 m, are required for morphological detection with optical microscopy. Conversely, pollen fragments with an aerodynamic diameter 10 m were collected in Lecce by the PM10 sampler. Pollen grains and fragments are spread worldwide by wind/atmospheric turbulences and can age in the atmosphere, but aerial dispersal, aging, and long-range transport of pollen fragments are favoured over those of whole pollen grains because of their smaller size.

The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcome events were calculated by the fixed effects model, and trial sequential analysis was applied to assess the results. RESULT: A total of ten randomized controlled trials and 60,782 patients with CAD was included. Compared with patients receiving placebo, anti-inflammatory therapy significantly reduced the incidence of the primary outcome in patients with CAD (RR 0.93, 0.89-0.98, P = 0.007). In addition, the anti-inflammatory therapy can also reduce the risk of MI (RR 0.90, 0.84-0.96, P = 0.002) and coronary revascularization (RR 0.74, 0.66-0.84, P < 0.00001) remarkably. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of cardiovascular death (RR 0.94, 0.86-1.02, P = 0.14), all-cause death (RR 1.00, 0.94-1.07, P = 0.98) and stroke (RR 0.96, 0.85-1.09, P = 0.51) between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-inflammatory therapy can reduce the incidence of the primary outcome in patients with CAD, especially the risk of MI and coronary revascularization. However, anti-inflammatory therapy increases the risk of infection.

In this study, women who attended a group medical visit at an osteoporosis center which involved fracture risk assessment and focused on autonomous decision-making made treatment decisions with high confidence. Those who started pharmacotherapy were highly persistent. PURPOSE Adherence and persistence with osteoporosis pharmacotherapy is low, possibly reflecting lack of confidence in physicians' treatment recommendations. We evaluated treatment decisions, decisional confidence, and 12-month treatment adherence among women who attended a group bone health consultation that fostered autonomous decision-making. METHODS We prospectively assessed postmenopausal women referred to an osteoporosis clinic who chose to attend a group medical visit in lieu of one-on-one consultation. The group visit was facilitated by a specialist physician and nurse, involving estimation of 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk (using FRAX?) and extensive education regarding fracture consequences and potential advantages and disadvantages of pharmacotherapy. No direct advice was given by the specialist. Post-consult, participants made an autonomous decision regarding treatment intent and followed up with their family physician to enact their chosen plan. Intentions to initiate pharmacotherapy were assessed immediately post-consult. Treatment status and decisional confidence were evaluated 3 and 12 months later. Three-month treatment status was considered to reflect final treatment decision. Persistence was defined as proportion of participants on treatment at 3 months who remained treated at 12 months. RESULTS One hundred one women (mean (SD) age, 62.7 years (5.8); median (IQR) FRAX?, 10.7% (8.3-17.6)) participated. Immediately post-consult, 27 (26.7%) intended to initiate treatment. At 3 months, 23 (22.8%) were treated, and at 12 months, 21 (91.3%) remained persistent. Of 89 questionnaire respondents at 12 months, 85 (95.5%) reported confidence in their treatment decision. CONCLUSION When postmenopausal women are provided with individualized fracture risk estimates and enabled to make autonomous decisions regarding pharmacotherapy, ultimate decisions to receive treatment are made with confidence and result in high persistence at 12 months.","output":"Autonomy begets adherence: decisions to start and persist with osteoporosis treatment after group medical consultation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Otolaryngologists are among the highest risk for COVID\\\\19 exposure.

The model enables a description of population migration at two levels. First, municipal populations are projected using the cohort-component method, and second, the spatial distribution of populations within municipalities is projected at a 500 m grid resolution with the use of the gravity model. Based on the Japanese depopulation context and the country's National Spatial Strategy, the compact scenario predicts the formation of medium-scale regional urban areas (population centers located across Japan) and the concentration of people on high-density population areas within municipalities. Meanwhile, the dispersed scenario predicts the formation of more but smaller regional urban areas and the dispersion of the population to low-density areas. The simulated population distribution for 2050 reveals spatial change in population density and age structure, as well as an abundance of areas that were inhabited in 2015 but will be zero population areas by 2050. Overlay analysis of future land use maps and the simulated population distribution maps can contribute toward identifying areas where natural capital such as farmland and forest plantation should be managed but where there will be significant population loss by 2050.","output":"Projecting population distribution under depopulation conditions in Japan: scenario analysis for future socio-ecological systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The main objective of this study was to use citation networks to analyze the relationship between different publications on the impact of cytokines at an ocular level and their authors.

Material and Methods: A total of 2168 patients who had no previously known chronic liver disease and were found to be COVID-19 positive on polymerase chain reaction test were divided into mild and severe COVID-19 groups. The effect of the development of liver damage on the course and prognosis of COVID-19 was investigated. Results: Elevated liver enzymes developed in 26.3% (n=461) of the patients with mild COVID-19 and in 45.3% (n=189) of the patients with severe COVID-19. The highest ALT and AST elevation was detected in patients using more than one drug with antibiotics (p<0.001). Severe hepatitis developed in 1.4% (n=25) of the patients with mild COVID-19 and 6.5% (n=27) of the patients with severe COVID-19 (p<0.001). There was a weak negative correlation between ALT and albumin (p=0.017, r=-0.497), while a weak positive correlation with bilirubin (p=0.024, r=0.352), a moderate positive correlation with ferritin (p=0.016, r=0.504), and a weak positive correlation with INR (p=0.022, r=0.383) were found in patients with severe COVID-19. Conclusion: The results showed that 30% of COVID-19 patients had impaired liver function of varying severity and that liver damage was more common in patients with severe COVID-19.

Associations were compared between persons with low or high assets. METHODS: A population-representative sample of 4011 Hong Kong Chinese residents aged 15 years or older were recruited between February and May 2020. Respondents reported current anxiety and depressive symptoms, unrest stress, COVID-19 stress, assets (savings and home ownership), and demographics. RESULTS: Stress due to unrest and COVID-19 was associated with higher prevalence of probable anxiety and depression; persons with both stressors had higher prevalence. This pattern was consistent among persons with low or high assets, but the probabilities of mental disorder were substantially higher among persons with fewer assets. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of stressors on probable anxiety and depression are cumulative: persons with stress due to civil unrest and to COVID-19 reported more mental disorders than persons with stress due to only one, or none of these factors.

However, little is known about the current status of patients use of e-communication with clinicians and whether the use is related to the better patient-perceived quality of care at the population level. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of and the factors associated with e-communication use and the association of e-communication use with patient-perceived quality of care by using the nationally representative sample of the 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey 5 (HINTS 5)-Cycle 3. METHODS: Data from 5438 adult responders (mean age 49.04 years, range 18-98 years) were included in this analysis. Multiple logistic and linear regressions were conducted to explore responders personal characteristics related to their use of e-communication with clinicians in the past 12 months and how their use was related to perceived quality of care. Descriptive analyses for e-communication use according to age groups were also performed. All analyses considered the complex survey design using the jackknife replication method. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of e-communication use was 60.3%, with a significantly lower prevalence in older adults (16.6%) than that in <45-year-old adults (41%) and 45-65-year-old adults (42.4%). All percentages are weighted; therefore, absolute values are not shown. American adults who used e-communication were more likely to be high school graduates (odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% CI 1.14-3.34; P=.02), some college degree holders (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.84-6.05; P<.001), and college graduates or more (OR 4.89, 95% CI 2.67-8.95; P<.001). Further, people who were females (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.18-1.82; P=.001), with a household income US $50,000 (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23-2.16; P=.001), with more comorbidities (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.40; P=.004), or having a regular health care provider (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.98-3.47; P<.001), were more likely to use e-communication. In contrast, those who resided in rural areas (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.88; P=.009) were less likely to use e-communication. After controlling for the sociodemographics, the number of comorbidities, and relationship factors (ie, having a regular provider and trusting a doctor), e-communication use was found to be significantly associated with better perceived quality of care (=.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.22; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the positive association between e-communication use and patient-perceived quality of care and suggested that policy-level attention should be raised to engage the socially disadvantaged (ie, those with lower levels of education and income, without a regular health care provider, and living in rural areas) to maximize e-communication use and to support better patient-perceived quality of care among American adults.","output":"Prevalence, Factors, and Association of Electronic Communication Use With Patient-Perceived Quality of Care From the 2019 Health Information National Trends Survey 5-Cycle 3: Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The implementation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines is one of the most effective interventions for improving quality of care. A gap between guidelines and clinical practice often exists, which may result in patients not receiving appropriate care. This project aimed at improving adherence to lung cancer guidelines at our institution. METHOD: The records of patients with lung cancer were evaluated for adherence to guidelines by using an auditing tool that was developed to capture pertinent information. The study team collected data about the following variables: compliance with documentation of pathological diagnosis, documentation of disease stage prior to treatment initiation, presentation at thoracic tumour board within 30 days of diagnosis, management course, and management of end of life in terms of early no code initiation, stopping chemotherapy and referral to palliative care prior to 2 weeks of death. Annual audits were performed from 2012 to 2015. Education and discussion with team members to address the deviations were the main interventions to improve adherence. RESULTS: The baseline measurements were taken in 2012 (49 patients). Histological subtype identification improved from 94% to 100%. Presentation of new cases at the tumour board improved from 35% to 82%. Testing for epidermal growth factor receptor mutation for non-squamous cell lung cancer improved from 77% to 100%.

HIV controllers suppress viral load to low levels in the absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART). We used an antibody profiling system, VirScan, to compare antibody reactivity and specificity in HIV controllers, non-controllers with treatment-induced viral suppression, and viremic non-controllers. METHODS: The VirScan library contains 3,384 phage-displayed peptides spanning the HIV proteome. Antibody reactivity to these peptides was measured in plasma from a Discovery Cohort that included 13 elite controllers, 27 viremic controllers, 12 viremic non-controllers, and 21 non-controllers who were virally suppressed on ART. Antibody reactivity to selected peptides was also assessed in an independent cohort of 29 elite controllers and 37 non-controllers who were virally suppressed on ART (Validation Cohort) and in a longitudinal cohort of non-controllers. RESULTS: In the Discovery Cohort, 62 peptides were preferentially targeted in HIV controllers compared to non-controllers who were virally suppressed on ART. These specificities were not significantly different when comparing controllers versus viremic non-controllers. Aggregate reactivity to these peptides was also high in elite controllers from the independent Validation Cohort. The 62 peptides formed seven clusters of homologous epitopes in env, gag, integrase, and vpu. Reactivity to one of these clusters located in gag p17 was inversely correlated with viral load set point in an independent cohort of non-controllers. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody reactivity was low in non-controllers suppressed on ART, but remained high in viremic controllers despite viral suppression. Antibodies in controllers and viremic non-controllers were directed against epitopes in diverse HIV proteins; higher reactivity against p17 peptides was associated with lower viral load set point. Further studies are needed to determine if these antibodies play a role in regulation of HIV viral load.","output":"HIV Antibody Profiles in HIV Controllers and Persons With Treatment-Induced Viral Suppression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19, a pandemic disease, and it is called the novel coronavirus. It belongs to the Coronaviridae family and has been plagued the world since the end of 2019. Viral infection to the lungs causes fluid filling and breathing difficulties, which leads to pneumonia. Pneumonia progresses to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), in which fluid fills the air sac and seeps from the pulmonary veins. In the current scenario, several vaccines have been used to control the pandemic worldwide. Even though vaccines are available and their effectiveness is short, it may be helpful to curb the pandemic, but long-term protection is inevitable when we look for other options. Plants have diversified components such as primary and secondary metabolites. These molecules show several activities such as anti-microbial, anti-cancer, anti-helminthic. In addition, these molecules have good binding ability to the SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins such as RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), Mpro (Main Protease), etc. Therefore, these herbal molecules could probably be used to control the COVID-19. However, pre-requisite tests, such as cytotoxicity, in vivo, and human experimental studies, are required before plant molecules can be used as potent drugs. Plant metabolites such as alkaloids, isoquinoline ?-carboline, and quinoline alkaloids such as skimmianine, quinine, cinchonine, and dictamine are present in plants and used in a traditional medicinal system.

Results of a large-scale study of 502 participants show that students suffered from stress and two types of COVID-19-related anxiety: disease and consequences. Students' preference for organization was the only factor that significantly promoted their perceived control over time, which contributes to reducing stress, hence, anxiety. However, female students reported higher stress and anxiety levels than male students. Graduate students reported higher anxiety levels related to the consequences of the pandemic compared to undergrads. To promote students' preference for organization, we map the three categories of organization to corresponding persuasive strategies which could be used in the design of persuasive interventions.

The problem with COVID-19 therapeutics is due to complexity of the mechanism of the pathogenesis of this virus. In this review, an extensive analysis of genome architecture and mode of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 with an emphasis on therapeutic approaches is performed. SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of a single, ~29.9 kb long RNA having significant sequence similarity to BAT-CoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Two-third part of SARS-Cov-2 genome comprises of ORF (ORF1ab) resulting in the formation of 2 polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, later processed into 16 smaller non-structural proteins (NSPs). The four major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the spike surface glycoprotein (S), a small envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. S protein helps in receptor binding and membrane fusion and hence plays the most important role in the transmission of CoVs. Priming of S protein is done by serine 2 transmembrane protease and thus plays a key role in virus and host cell fusion.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus displays unique features including widely varying symptoms and outcomes between infected individuals. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into virus transmission dynamics, pre-existing cross-reactive immunity, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. This BU ELISA method exhibits very low signal from plasma or serum samples added to uncoated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) reactive antibodies from blood samples drawn prior to May 2019. Of our pre-pandemic cohort, no SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive IgG antibodies were detected in subjects over 70 years of age, and SARS-CoV-2 NP-reactive antibodies were present at similar levels to infected subjects in some individuals and very low in others. Also, samples drawn in May 2020 from two individuals with no symptoms or no known virus exposure contained SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive antibodies at intermediate amounts compared with other subject groups (higher than pre-pandemic and lower than confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected). The one asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 convalescent subject in our study possessed comparable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific IgM and IgG but drastically lower IgA than the symptomatic counterparts. Also, our assay detected positive signal from samples that gave negative results in a commercially available Lateral Flow Device (LFD) and the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","output":"An ELISA protocol with resolution at high sample concentration reveals reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the major healthcare challenges is elderly fallers.

However, the functional effects of most of these variants are unknown. Moreover, GWASs do not provide context-specific information on cell types or environmental factors that affect specific disease risks and outcomes. To address these limitations, we used an upper airway epithelial cell (AEC) culture model to assess transcriptional and epigenetic responses to rhinovirus (RV), an asthma-promoting pathogen, and provide context-specific functional annotations to variants discovered in GWASs of asthma. METHODS: Genome-wide genetic, gene expression, and DNA methylation data in vehicle- and RV-treated upper AECs were collected from 104 individuals who had a diagnosis of airway disease (n=66) or were healthy participants (n=38). We mapped cis expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs and cis-meQTLs, respectively) in each treatment condition (RV and vehicle) in AECs from these individuals. A Bayesian test for colocalization between AEC molecular QTLs and adult onset asthma and childhood onset asthma GWAS SNPs, and a multi-ethnic GWAS of asthma, was used to assign the function to variants associated with asthma. We used Mendelian randomization to demonstrate DNA methylation effects on gene expression at asthma colocalized loci. RESULTS: Asthma and allergic disease-associated GWAS SNPs were specifically enriched among molecular QTLs in AECs, but not in GWASs from non-immune diseases, and in AEC eQTLs, but not among eQTLs from other tissues. Colocalization analyses of AEC QTLs with asthma GWAS variants revealed potential molecular mechanisms of asthma, including QTLs at the TSLP locus that were common to both the RV and vehicle treatments and to both childhood onset and adult onset asthma, as well as QTLs at the 17q12-21 asthma locus that were specific to RV exposure and childhood onset asthma, consistent with clinical and epidemiological studies of these loci. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of functional effects for asthma risk variants in AECs and insight into RV-mediated transcriptional and epigenetic response mechanisms that modulate genetic effects in the airway and risk for asthma.

The spectrum of vascular events varies from deep venous thrombosis to catastrophic APS, a rare form characterized by acute multiorgan thrombosis and high mortality. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 32-week pregnant woman arriving in the hospital emergency room with bilateral acute lower limb ischemia. In the obstetric evaluation, fetal death was declared. Computerized Tomography angiography showed pulmonary embolism of both pulmonary arteries, areas of splenic and right renal infarction and multiple arterial and venous thrombosis. The patient underwent urgent caesarean section and axillary-bifemoral bypass. No events registered. In the postoperative period, in an intensive care unit, treatment with rituximab and plasmapheresis were added to anticoagulant therapy. The laboratorial investigation was negative for thrombophilia and autoimmune diseases. CONCLUSION: Catastrophic APS develops quickly, with multiorgan involvement and high mortality rate. The presented case poses a multidisciplinary challenge, with the surgical approach of extra-anatomical revascularization being less invasive and guaranteeing immediate perfusion of the lower limbs. Although the serological tests were negative for anti-phospholipid antibodies, this case hardly fits into another diagnosis. Therefore, it was treated as a catastrophic APS, having shown a favorable evolution.","output":"A catastrophic seronegative anti-phospholipid syndrome: case and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study examines the effects of workplace rumors and organizational formalization on the degree of role ambiguity and emotional exhaustion that university employees in the Philippines are experiencing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The interaction between the two variables is also analyzed.

The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that both workplace rumors and organizational formalization are associated positively with role ambiguity and emotional exhaustion, and role ambiguity mediates workplace rumors' effect on emotional exhaustion. Moreover, the moderating effect analysis shows that workplace rumors and organizational formalization interact and intensify the degree of role ambiguity and emotional exhaustion that employees experience.

However, there remain significant research gaps on the utilization of ML models for decision-making and their impact on survival outcomes. The purpose of this study was to develop ML models that effectively predict hospital's practice to perform coronary angiography (CA) in adult patients after OHCA and subsequent neurologic outcomes. METHODS We utilized all (N = 2398) patients treated by the Chicago Fire Department Emergency Medical Services included in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) between 2013 and 2018 who survived to hospital admission to develop, test, and analyze ML models for decisions after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and patient survival. ML classification models, including the Embedded Fully Convolutional Network (EFCN) model, were compared based on their ability to predict post-ROSC decisions and survival. RESULTS The EFCN classification model achieved the best results across tested ML algorithms. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for CA and Survival were 0.908 and 0.896 respectively. Through cohort analyses, our model predicts that 18.3% (CI 16.4-20.2) of patients should receive a CA that did not originally, and 30.1% (CI 28.5-31.7) of these would experience improved survival outcomes.

Although SEM can determine relationships amongst unobserved constructs (i.e. independent, mediator, moderator, control and dependent variables), it is insufficient for providing non-compensatory relationships amongst constructs. In contrast with previous studies, a newly proposed methodology that involves a dual-stage analysis of SEM and ANN was performed to provide linear and non-compensatory relationships amongst constructs. Consequently, numerous distinct types of studies in diverse sectors have conducted hybrid SEMCANN analysis. Accordingly, the current work supplements the academic literature with a systematic review that includes all major SEMCANN techniques used in 11 industries published in the past 6 years. This study presents a state-of-the-art SEMCANN classification taxonomy based on industries and compares the effort in various domains to that classification. To achieve this objective, we examined the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus and IEEE Xplore(?) databases to retrieve 239 articles from 2016 to 2021. The obtained articles were filtered on the basis of inclusion criteria, and 60 studies were selected and classified under 11 categories. This multi-field systematic study uncovered new research possibilities, motivations, challenges, limitations and recommendations that must be addressed for the synergistic integration of multidisciplinary studies. It contributed two points of potential future work resulting from the developed taxonomy. First, the importance of the determinants of play, musical and art therapy adoption amongst autistic children within the healthcare sector is the most important consideration for future investigations. In this context, the second potential future work can use SEMCANN to determine the barriers to adopting sensing-enhanced therapy amongst autistic children to satisfy the recommendations provided by the healthcare sector. The analysis indicates that the manufacturing and technology sectors have conducted the most number of investigations, whereas the construction and small- and medium-sized enterprise sectors have conducted the least. This study will provide a helpful reference to academics and practitioners by providing guidance and insightful knowledge for future studies.","output":"Hybrid artificial neural network and structural equation modelling techniques: a survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compreende-se um Sistema Alimentar como o conjunto de processos e recursos necessrios desde a produ??o at o consumo e o descarte do alimento.

One-hundred six measurements in 19 ICU patients were collected. Despite enoxaparin 60 mg once daily, only two measurements of the trough anti-Xa were in the upper end of prophylactic range.

DESIGN We performed an update of a Cochrane systematic review, and performed network meta-analysis comparing randomised trials evaluating colorectal cancer screening with guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) (annual, biennial), faecal immunochemical test (FIT) (annual, biennial), sigmoidoscopy (once-only) or colonoscopy (once-only) in a healthy population, aged 50-79 years. We conducted subgroup analysis on sex. Follow-up >5 years was required for analysis of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. RESULTS 12 randomised trials proved eligible. Compared with no-screening, we found high certainty evidence for sigmoidoscopy screening slightly reducing colorectal cancer incidence (relative risk (RR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI 0.70 to 0.83) and mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80), while gFOBT screening had little or no difference on colorectal cancer incidence, but slightly reduced colorectal cancer mortality (annual: RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.86, biennial: RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.93). No screening test reduced mortality nor incidence by more than six per 1000 screened over 15 years. Sigmoidoscopy had a greater effect in men, for both colorectal cancer incidence (women: RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.92, men: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.79), and mortality (women: RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96, men: RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.75) (moderate certainty). CONCLUSIONS In a 15-year perspective, sigmoidoscopy reduces colorectal cancer incidence, while sigmoidoscopy, annual and biennial gFOBT all reduce colorectal cancer mortality.

The translation of these signals into tissue-specific responses is crucial for metamorphosis, but the mechanisms that confer specificity to systemic ecdysone pulses are far from understood. Here, we identify Bric--brac 2 (Bab2) as an ecdysone-responsive transcriptional repressor that controls temporal gene expression during larval to pupal transition. Bab2 is necessary to terminate Salivary gland secretion (Sgs) gene expression, while premature Bab2 expression blocks Sgs genes and causes precocious salivary gland histolysis. The timely expression of bab2 is controlled by the ecdysone-responsive transcription factor Broad, and manipulation of EcR/USP/Broad signaling induces inappropriate Bab2 expression and termination of Sgs gene expression. Bab2 directly binds to Sgs loci in vitro and represses all Sgs genes in vivo.

Interestingly, arguments for an interaction between vestibular, motor and cognitive functions in children can also be supported by research on children known for their difficulties in motor and/or cognitive processing (eg, children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD)), as they often present with vestibular-like characteristics. Therefore, in order to elucidate this interaction, and to increase the understanding of the pathophysiology and symptomatology of vestibular disorders and NDD in children, the Balanced Growth project was developed. It includes the following objectives: (1) to understand the association between motor skills, cognitive performances and the vestibular function in typically developing school-aged children, with special focus on the added value of the vestibular system in higher cognitive skills and motor competence; (2) to investigate whether a vestibular dysfunction (with/without an additional auditory disease) has an impact on motor skills, cognitive performances and motorCcognitive interactions in children and (3) to assess if an underlying vestibular dysfunction can be identified in school-aged children with NDD, with documentation of the occurrence and characteristics of vestibular dysfunctions in this group of children using an extensive vestibular test battery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In order to achieve the objectives of the observational cross-sectional Balanced Growth study, a single-task and dual-task test protocol was created, which will be performed in three groups of school-aged children (6C12 years old): (1) a typically developing group (n=140), (2) (audio) vestibular-impaired children (n=30) and (3) children with an NDD diagnosis (n=55) (ie, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and/or developmental coordination disorder). The test protocol consists of several custom-made tests and already existing validated test batteries and includes a vestibular assessment, an extensive motor assessment, eight neurocognitive tests, a cognitiveCmotor interaction assessment and includes also additional screenings to control for potential confounding factors (eg, hearing status, intelligence, physical activity, etc).

All research findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at vestibular as well as multidisciplinary international conferences and meetings.

The major routes of entry of pharmaceuticals into the environment are industries, hospitals, or direct disposal of unwanted or expired drugs made by the patient.

This distinctive feature makes pharmaceuticals and their metabolites different from other chemicals, and this necessitates the evaluation of the direct effects of pharmaceuticals in various environmental compartments as well as to living systems. In this background, the alarming situation of ecotoxicity of diverse pharmaceuticals have forced government and nongovernment regulatory authorities to recommend the application of in silico methods to provide quick information about the risk assessment and fate properties of pharmaceuticals as well as their ecological and indirect human health effects. This chapter aims to offer information regarding occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment, their persistence, environmental fate, and toxicity as well as application of in silico methods to provide information about the basic risk management and fate prediction of pharmaceuticals in the environment.

SETTING: Multicenter randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: A total of 868 couples with unexplained infertility (n=2,459 cycles). INTERVENTIONS: OS-IUI treatment cycles (n = 2,459) as part of the AMIGOS clinical trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Live birth rates; unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RR) for live birth by EMT category, calculated using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: The overall mean EMT on day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration in cycles with a live birth was significantly greater than in those without. Compared to the referent EMT group of 9 to 12 mm, the unadjusted RR for live birth for the EMT groups of &#8804;5 and 6-8 were 0.48 and 0.92, respectively. The test for trend indicated evidence of decreasing LBR with decreasing EMT. After adjustment for ovarian stimulation medication, a linear trend was no longer supported.

Students learn and practice how to train local caregiver groups in attachment-based care, using training sessions developed in local languages, adjusted to culture. At present, the author's Fairstart Foundation educated 500 staff from partners in 26 countries, who have trained the caregivers of some 40,000 children. The theoretical, logistic and technical steps from research to daily caregiver-child practices are described, to inspire discussions of how online designs and international partnerships may benefit underserved populations.

Treatment and monitoring of patients require regular specialized in- and outpatient care. Patients with PD are more likely to have a complicated disease course if they become infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Regular in-hospital appointments place these patients at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to travel and contact with other patients and staff. However, guidelines for the management of outpatients with PD during times of increased risk of infection are currently lacking. These are urgently needed to conduct riskCbenefit evaluations to recommend the best medical treatment. This article discusses best practice approaches based on the current literature, as suggested by the multidisciplinary Network of University Medicine (NUM) in Germany. These include measures such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, social distancing measures, and appropriate testing strategies in outpatient settings, which can minimize the risk of exposure. Furthermore, the urgency of appointments should be considered. Visits of low urgency may be conducted by general practitioners or via telemedicine consultations, whereas in-person presentation is required in case of moderate and high urgency visits. Classification of urgency should be carried out by skilled medical staff, and telemedicine (telephone or video consultations) may be a useful tool in this situation. The currently approved vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are safe and effective for patients with PD and play a key role in minimizing infection risk for patients with PD.","output":"Best practice approaches to outpatient management of people living with Parkinsons disease during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of new normal lifestyles, economic and social distribution, and individuals well-being of people in China after the country ease the lockdown restriction. METHODS: A cross-sectional, self-administered online survey was carried out between 3 September and 15 October 2020. RESULTS: A total of 8393 complete responses were received from a nationwide sample. Poor sustainability in the practice of new norm was reported. Noteworthy disparities were observed in willingness to carry out new normal practices by gender, urban-rural locality, non-Han and Han Chinese and educational attainment. There was evidence of economic and social disruption associated with COVID-19 or new normal practices. The current mean (standard deviation [SD]) happiness score (110.45  17.55) was slightly lower than the mean happiness score before (111.12  17.83) the COVID-19 pandemic (t= ?9.01, p<0.001). Lower socioeconomic status and greater economic and social disruptions were associated with lower current happiness scores. Moreover, greater willingness to adapt to new normal practices was associated with higher levels of happiness. CONCLUSION: There is a need to encourage sustainable practice of new norm post-pandemic.

Japan has succeeded in reducing the number of landslide fatalities and is one of the few countries with long-term databases of landslide fatalities. In this study, we identified the factors that contributed to the decrease in fatalities associated with rainfall-triggered landslides in Japan between 1945 and 2019. We examined trends in landslide fatalities and six factors for Periods I, II, III, IV, and V-each period spans 15 years of the study period-and for Periods I-II, II-III, III-IV, and IV-V. We examined the trends in the number of landslides (NL) and in the ratio between the number of fatalities (NF) and the number of landslides (NF/NL), and considered fatalities as the product of the number of landslides and the probability of fatalities. The number of fatalities decreased continuously between Periods I and IV; the rate of the decrease declined over time. During Period I-II, NF/NL decreased, whereas NL remained unchanged. Decreases in the average number of household members, changes in building structure, and increases in the number of people evacuated may have contributed to the decrease in NF/NL. During Periods II-III and III-IV, NL also decreased. During Period II-III, the area of mature forests increased slowly. During Period III-IV, the implementation of structural measures (i.e., hard measures) was aggressively pursued. The factors that contributed to the decrease in landslide fatalities changed with time, suggesting that measures for reducing landslide fatalities changed according to the degree of maturity of the nation. Furthermore, we identified increases in rainfall and NL in Period V, which might indicate a future increase in landslide fatalities.","output":"Changes in the factors contributing to the reduction of landslide fatalities between 1945 and 2019 in Japan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on road traffic collisions, fatalities, and injuries using time series analyses. To that aim, a database containing road collisions, fatalities, and slight injuries data from Greece were derived from the Hellenic Statistical Authority (HSA) and covered a ten-year timeframe (from January 2010 to August 2020. The chosen time period contained normal operations, as well as the period of the first COVID-19-induced lockdown period in Greece. Three different Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series models were implemented in order to compare the observed measurements to forecasted values that were intended to depict assumed conditions; namely, without the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic. Modelling results revealed that the total number of road collisions, fatalities, and slightly injured were decreased, mainly due to the sharp traffic volume decrease. However, the percentage reduction of the collision variables and traffic volume were found to be disproportionate, which probably indicates that more collisions occurred with regard to the prevailing traffic volume. An additional finding is that fatalities and slightly injured rates were significantly increased during the lockdown period and the subsequent month. Overall, it can be concluded that a worse performance was identified in terms of road safety. Since subsequent waves of COVID-19 cases and other pandemics may reappear in the future, the outcomes of the current study may be exploited for the improvement of road safety from local authorities and policymakers.","output":"Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on collisions, fatalities and injuries using time series forecasting: The case of Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Septic Embolism in a Patient with Infective Endocarditis and COVID-19.","output":"Septic Embolism in a Patient with Infective Endocarditis and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral particles of human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) consist of three virion structural proteins, including spike protein, membrane protein, and envelope protein.

Objective This review intended to evaluate the comorbidities of the oral cavity and their relationships to COVID-19 and to show the benefits of homeopathic therapies as adjuvant treatments to increase oral and general health and mitigate the devastating effects of the coronavirus. Design The authors conducted a narrative review of articles published in indexed journals and websites of dental institutions and the WHO. They were selected oral pathological manifestations, sleep disorders, mood, orofacial pain and bruxism, associated with the oral-facial manifestations of Covid-19 and articles of evidence of homeopathy in dentistry. Setting Study done in Brazil with research professors in Homeopathy and Periodontics in universities. Results Some studies report that patients who are more susceptible to anxiety and stress during the pandemic, due to social confinement, may have disorders in the stomatognathic system such as: neuralgic pain in the face and teeth, fractures of teeth and dental prostheses, nibbled mucosa, stomatitis, ulcers, pain in the Temporal Mandibular Joint, otalgias, dental tightening, bruxism, xerostomia, peeling of the mucous membranes and skin, facial paralysis. Conclusions The researchers concluded that homeopathy is a safe and viable therapy for the control of COVID-19 symptoms, as scientific evidence has proven its benefits through clinical trials and use in previous epidemics.

The effectiveness of these and other intervention measures is threatened by the emergence of numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We present a model for studying the transmission dynamics of two of these variants (Delta and Omicron) in the presence of vaccination, treatment of individuals with clinical symptoms of the disease and the use of face masks in the community. The model was fitted using daily case data for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States corresponding to the period starting from when Omicron first emerged (end of November 2021) to date. It is shown, based on simulating the model with the current COVID-19 data, that the reproduction number of the Delta variant (denoted by Rvd) is much smaller than one (Rvd = 0.28), while that of Omicron (denoted by Rvo) is approximately equal to unity (Rvo = 0.96). This shows that the Delta variant has essentially died out, and that Omicron is currently the predominant variant of concern in the United States. Furthermore, if the current baseline levels of the control measures being implemented in the United States are maintained, the Omicron variant will also be on a rapid decline (towards elimination). The analysis and simulations of the calibrated model show that vaccine-derived immunity can be achieved in the United States if at least 68% of the population is fully-vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. It is shown that the COVID-19 pandemic can be eliminated in the United States by June of 2022 if the current baseline level of the proportion of individuals that is fully-vaccinated is increased by about 20%. The threshold vaccination coverage needed to achieve the vaccine-derived herd immunity decreases if the vaccination program is combined with a face mask use strategy, particularly one that emphasizes the use of moderate to high quality masks (e.g., surgical or N95 masks). Greater reduction in disease burden (in comparison to the baseline scenario) are recorded if the very high quality N95 masks are prioritized in the community, followed by the moderately-effective surgical masks and then the lowly-effective cloth masks. We also showed that having high percentage of the populace wearing the moderately-effective surgical mask is more beneficial to the community than having low percentage of the populace wearing the highly-effective N95 masks (this result does not hold for the case when cloth masks compliance is compared with that of N95 masks). However, if a certain (fixed) percentage is to give up masking, our study showed that it is more beneficial if they give up wearing surgical masks and not N95 masks (in other words, in a head-to-head comparison, N95 is always superior than surgical mask). This study showed that waning natural and vaccine-derived immunity (if considered individually) offer marginal impact on disease burden, except for the case when they wane at a much faster rate (e.g., within three months), in comparison to the baseline (estimated to be within 9 months to a year). Greater reduction or increase in disease burden is recorded if both the vaccine-derived and natural immunity wane at the same time (rather than the case when we considered only one of them varying, while the other is at baseline). For instance, if both vaccine-derived and natural immunity wane within three months, a 14% increase in the peak daily cases will be recorded, in comparison to the baseline. For this case, where immunity wanes within three months, our study predicts another (but milder) Omicron wave in the United States that peaks around July 2022 (with the peak 72% lower than the original Omicron peak). Under this (fast waning) scenario, our study suggests that a fourth dose of the two mRNA vaccines would need to be approved in the United States to aid and accelerate the prospect of SARS-CoV-2 elimination in 2022. It is shown that while the treatment of symptomatic individuals has marginal effect in reducing daily cases of SARS-CoV-2, in comparison to the baseline, it has significant impact in reducing daily hospitalizations. It is further shown that, while treatment significantly reduces hospitalization, the prospects of COVID-19 elimination in the United States is more significantly enhanced if investments in control resources are focused on mask usage and vaccination rather than on treatment.","output":"Dynamics of the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States: the battle of supremacy in the presence of vaccination, mask usage and antiviral treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the individual and collective influence of conspiracy theories, misinformation and knowledge revolving around COVID-19, on public adoption of the Nigerian government's containment policies.

It is unknown how these behavioral shifts may differ by sociodemographic characteristics and whether shifts may widen or diminish existing diet-related disparities. To fill these gaps, we use nationally-representative Consumer Panel survey data to examine shifts in online grocery shopping by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: The Nielsen COVID-19 Shopper Behavior Survey was administered to a subset of Nielsen Homescan panel participants in March-April 2020 (n = 17,262 households (HH)). We describe survey-weighted HH sociodemographic characteristics and reasons for online shopping. Survey weighted-multivariable logistic regression was used to examine sociodemographic correlates of reported increases in online food shopping. RESULTS: One third (34%) of our survey-weighted sample said they shopped for groceries online more since COVID-19, and 60% of these HH reported planning to continue shopping online after COVID-19. In adjusted analyses, all age groups (40C54 y, 55C64y, 65 + y) had lower odds of online shopping than heads of HH 39 years or younger (all OR = 0.7, P < 0.001). Lower educated (high school or less) HH had lower odds of online shopping compared to higher educated (college or more) HH (OR = 0.7, P < 0.001). HH in the South had higher odds of online shopping than those in the Northeast (OR = 1.2, P = 0.006). Compared to Non-Hispanic (NH) white HH, Hispanic HH had higher odds of online shopping (OR = 1.2, P = 0.02), and NH Asian HH had lower odds of online shopping (OR = 0.8, P = 0.02). HH with children had higher odds of online shopping compared to households without children (OR = 1.4, P < 0.001). Of those who said they would increase the amount of online shopping they did for everyday items including food (37%), the top reasons were to avoid public germs and COVID-19 (81%), to take advantage of the convenience (44%) and to access a better selection (17%).

METHODS The search strategy was restricted to publications in English before December 1, 2019 in the PsycINFO, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. We only included oral diseases considered as public health issues with a global burden. As a result, investigations reporting the frequency of brushing, poor lifestyle behaviours, non-white ethnicity, DMFT scores, and periodontal disease as an outcome were included. The two reviewers resolved any disagreements. Reviewers analyzed the full-texts, considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Also, a manual search of the reference lists was performed on all the selected studies. RESULTS In total, 11 publications were included in the meta-analysis. Findings indicate a positive association between non-white ethnicity and PQoL among PW. Among PW, those who had non-white ethnicity were 1.43 times more likely to have PQoL (OR= 1.43, 95% CI=1.17, 1.70). A positive association between DMFT and poor QoL among PW was also observed.

In a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) world, such time-lags feel intolerable. In these extraordinary circumstances could years be made into months? If so, could those lessons be used to accelerate medical research when the crisis eases? To measure time-lags in health and biomedical research as well as to identify ways of reducing them, we developed and published (in 2015) a matrix consisting of overlapping tracks (or stages/phases) in the translation from discovery research to developed products, policies and practice. The matrix aids analysis by highlighting the time and actions required to develop research (and its translation) both (1) along each track and (2) from one track to another, e.g. from the discovery track to the research-in-humans track. We noted four main approaches to reducing time-lags, namely increasing resources, working in parallel, starting or working at risk, and improving processes. Examining these approaches alongside the matrix helps interpret the enormous global effort to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Rapid progress in the discovery/basic and human research tracks is being made through a combination of large-scale funding, work being conducted in parallel (between different teams globally and through working in overlapping tracks), working at greater (but proportionate) risk to safety than usual, and adopting various new processes. The overlapping work of some of the teams involves continuing animal research whilst entering vaccine candidates into Phase I trials alongside planning their Phase II trials. The additional funding available helps to reduce some of the usual financial risks in moving so quickly. Going forward through the increasingly large human trials for safety, dosage and efficacy, it will be vital to overlap work in parallel in the often challenging public policy and clinical tracks. Thus, regulatory and reimbursement bodies are beginning and preparing rapid action to pull vaccines proving to be safe and effective through to extraordinarily rapid application to the general population. Monitoring the development of a COVID-19 vaccine using the matrix (modified as necessary) could help identify which of the approaches speeding development and deployment could be usefully applied more widely in the future.","output":"From COVID-19 research to vaccine application: why might it take 17 months not 17 years and what are the wider lessons?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate prevalence of ongoing activation of inflammation following asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection we characterized immune cell transcriptomes from 43 asymptomatic seropositive and 52 highly exposed seronegative individuals with few underlying health issues following a community superspreading event Four mildly symptomatic seropositive individuals examined three weeks after infection as positive controls demonstrated immunological activation Approximately four to six weeks following the event, the two asymptomatic groups showed no significant differences Two seropositive patients with underlying genetic disease impacting immunological activation were included (Cystic Fibrosis (CF), Nuclear factor-kappa B Essential Modulator (NEMO) deficiency) CF, but not NEMO, associated with significant immune transcriptome differences including some associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (IL1B, IL17A, respective receptors) All subjects remained in their usual state of health from event through five-month follow-up Here, asymptomatic infection resolved without evidence of prolonged immunological activation Inclusion of subjects with underlying genetic disease illustrated the pathophysiological importance of context on impact of immunological response","output":"Immune transcriptomes of highly exposed SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic seropositive versus seronegative individuals from the Ischgl community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Oncology has been facing increasing outpatient activity associated with higher cancer incidence, better survival rates, and more treatment options. Innovative technological solutions could help deal with this increasing demand. Using digital patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to identify patients who need a face-to-face (FTF) appointment is a potential approach. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of digital PROM questionnaires to enable remote symptom monitoring for patients undergoing cancer treatment and their ability to highlight the requirement for an FTF appointment. METHODS: This study was performed at a tertiary oncology center between December 2018 and February 2019. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were adapted into patient-friendly language to form the basis of treatment-specific digital questionnaires covering specific cancer drugs and radiotherapy treatments. These treatment-specific digital PROM questionnaires were scored by both patients and their clinicians during FTF appointments. Patients and clinicians did not see each others scored PROMs. Agreement between patients and clinicians was assessed using descriptive statistics. Patient and staff feedback was also obtained. RESULTS: In total, 90 patients participated in the study across 10 different treatment pathways. By comparing paired patient and clinician responses, the sensitivity of the patient-completed questionnaires in correctly highlighting the need for FTF review was 94% (44/47), and all patients with severe or grade 3+ symptoms were identified (6/6, 100%). Patient-completed PROMs appropriately revealed that 29% (26/90) of the participating patients did not need FTF review based on their symptoms alone. Certain oncological treatment pathways, such as immunotherapy, were found to have a larger proportion of patients with minimal symptoms than others, such as conventional chemotherapy. Patient and staff feedback showed high approval of digital PROMs and their potential for use in remote monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Digital PROM questionnaires can feasibly highlight the need for FTF review in oncology clinics for treatment. Their use with specific treatments could safely reduce the requirement for FTF care, and future work should evaluate their application in the remote monitoring of patients.","output":"Digital Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Monitoring of Patients on Cancer Treatment: Cross-sectional Questionnaire Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the past two decades, lung transplant has become the mainstay of treatment for several end-stage lung diseases.

We review the referral and listing criteria for some common pulmonary diseases and also cite the updated literature surrounding the absolute and relative contraindications keeping in mind that they are a constantly moving target. Frailty and psychosocial barriers are difficult to assess with the current assessment tools but continue to impact posttransplant outcomes. Finally, we discuss the limited data on transplantation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID19 as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridge to transplantation.

Although studies have attempted to define high-volume days, no standard definition exists. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the frequency of high-volume days, by any definition, is related to the size of an ED. We aimed to determine the correlation between ED size and the frequency of high-volume days for various volume thresholds, and to develop a measure to identify high-volume days. METHODS: We queried retrospective patient arrival data including 1,682,374 patient visits from 32 EDs in 12 states between July 1, 2018CJune 30, 2019 and developed linear regression models to determine the correlation between ED size and volume variability. In addition, we performed a regression analysis and applied the Pearson correlation test to investigate the significance of median daily volumes with respect to the percent of days that crossed four volume thresholds ranging from 5C20% (in 5% increments) greater than each sites median daily volume. RESULTS: We found a strong negative correlation between ED median daily volume and volume variability (R(2) = 81.0%; P < 0.0001). In addition, the four regression models for the percent of days exceeding specified thresholds greater than their daily median volumes had R(2) values of 49.4%, 61.2%, 70.0%, and 71.8%, respectively, all with P < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: We sought to determine whether smaller EDs experience high-volume days more frequently than larger EDs. We found that high-volume days, when defined as days with a count of arrivals at or above certain median-based thresholds, are significantly more likely to occur in lower-volume EDs than in higher-volume EDs. To the extent that EDs allocate resources and plan to staff based on median volumes, these results suggest that smaller EDs are more likely to experience unpredictable, volume-based staffing challenges and operational costs. Given the lack of a standard measure to define a high-volume day in an ED, we recommend 10% above the median daily volume as a metric, for its relevance, generalizability across a broad range of EDs, and computational simplicity.","output":"Are Smaller Emergency Departments More Prone to Volume Variability?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We constructed a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded model of the spread of COVID-19.

It invades host cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This newly discovered virus can result in excessive inflammation and immune pathological damage, as shown by a decreased number of peripheral lymphocytes, increased levels of cytokines, and damages of lung, heart, liver, kidney, and other organs. Effective therapeutic modalities such as new antiviral drugs and vaccines against this emerging virus need to be thoroughly studied and developed. However, so far the only recognized but mild progress in this area is the screening of old drugs for new uses. Therefore, rapid and accurate laboratory SARS-CoV-2 testing approaches are the important basis of identification and blockage of COVID-19 transmission. For COVID-19 patients with different clinical classifications (mild, common, severe, and critically severe), dynamic monitoring of functional indicators of susceptible and vital organs is an important strategy for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. In this review, we summarized SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostic schemes, pathophysiological indices of tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, and laboratory diagnostic strategies for distinct disease stages.

The main messages from our study are to propose a guideline for the safe use of CS and to define situations when breast pump decontamination might be necessary: vulnerable babies for which sterile device is recommended; special circumstances, for example the current COVID-19 pandemic; special situations, for example women living in precarious conditions; or women pumping their milk at work but that would have low or no access to boiled water. Overall, cold decontamination reduced losses of milk for bacteriological reasons in human milk banks and may also be interesting to prevent horizontal contamination by virus like COVID-19.","output":"Chlorine Solutions for a Safe Method of Decontamination of Breast Pump Milk Collection Kits Before and After the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-20 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic on 11th of March 2020.

We identify heparan sulfate as an important attachment factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we show that sialic acids present on ACE2 prevent efficient spike/ACE2-interaction. While SARS-CoV infection is substantially limited by the sialic acid-mediated restriction in both human lung epithelial cells and ex vivo human lung tissues, infection by SARS-CoV-2 is limited to a lesser extent.

It was unraveled that RBC osmotic fragility and caspase-like proteasomal activity can link both donor cohorts to post-storage states. In the case of heterozygotes, the geometry, size and intrinsic low RBC fragility might be lying behind their higher post-storage resistance to lysis and recovery in mice. Moreover, energy-related molecules (e.g., phosphocreatine) and purine metabolism factors (IMP, hypoxanthine) were specifically linked to lower post-storage hemolysis and phosphatidylserine exposure. The latter was also ameliorated by antioxidants, such as urate. Finally, higher proteasomal conservation across the transfusion chain was observed in heterozygotes compared to control donors.

Online population health interventions have been shown to impact health behaviors positively. For online interventions to be successful, they must employ effective learning design strategies that seek to address known issues with learner engagement and retention. To know if an intervention successfully addresses vaccine hesitancy, there must be some embedded measure to compare the learner pre-intervention and post-intervention. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to study the effectiveness of an online population health intervention designed to address vaccine misinformation and hesitancy. The study will examine learner analytics to understand what aspects of the learning design for the intervention were effective and implement a validated instrument, the Adult Vaccine Hesitancy Scale, to measure if any changes in vaccine hesitancy were observed pre- and post-intervention. METHODS: We developed a fully online population health intervention to help learners identify misinformation concerning COVID-19 and share the science behind vaccinations. The intervention development utilizes a design-based research approach to output more effective interventions in which data can be analyzed to improve future health interventions. The study uses a quasi-experimental design in which a pre-post survey is given and compared statistically. Learning analytics will also be generated based on engagement and retention data collected through the intervention to understand what aspects of our learning design were effective. RESULTS: The online intervention was released to the public in September 2021, and data collection is ongoing. No external marketing or advertising has been done to market the course, making our current population of 486 participants our pilot study population. Analysis of this initial population will enable revision to the intervention, which will then be marketed to a broader audience. Study outcomes are expected to be published by August 2022. We anticipate the release of the revised intervention by May 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminating accurate information to the public during pandemic situations is vital to helping to contribute to positive health outcomes such as those which come from people getting vaccinated. Online interventions are valuable as they can reach people anytime, anywhere. However, online interventions must employ sound learning design to help incentive engagement and motivate learners to learn and provide a means of evaluating the intervention to determine impact. This study will examine both the learning design and the effectiveness of the intervention using analytics collected within the intervention and a statistical analysis of a validated instrument to determine if learners had a change in vaccine hesitancy as a result of what they learned.

This problem may worsen with abnormal situations, e.g., the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Taking this into consideration, this paper presents a first study on the COVID-19 impact on ambulances TT by analyzing historical data from the Departmental Fire and Rescue Service of the Doubs (SDIS 25), in France, for three hospitals. Because the TTs of SDIS 25 ambulances increased, this paper also calculated and analyzed the number of breakdowns in services, which augmented due to shortage of ambulances that return on service in time. It is, therefore, vital to have a decision-support tool to better reallocate resources by knowing the time EMSs ambulances and personnel will be in use. Thus, this paper proposes a novel two-stage methodology based on machine learning (ML) models to forecast the TT of each ambulance in a given time and hospital. The first stage uses a multivariate model of regularly spaced time series to predict the average TT (AvTT) per hour, which considers temporal variables and external ones (e.g., COVID-19 statistics, weather data). The second stage utilizes a multivariate irregularly spaced time series model, which considers temporal variables of each ambulance departure, type of intervention, external variables, and the previously predicted AvTT as inputs. Four state-of-the-art ML models were considered in this paper, namely, Light Gradient Boosted Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, Long Short-Term Memory, and Prophet. As shown in the results, the proposed methodology provided remarkable results for practical purposes. The AvTT accuracies obtained for the three hospitals were 90.16%, 97.02%, and 93.09%. And the TT accuracies were 74.42%, 86.63%, and 76.67%, all with an error margin of 10 min.","output":"Machine learning-based forecasting of firemen ambulances turnaround time in hospitals, considering the COVID-19 impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pulse oximeter apps became of interest to consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly when traditional over-the-counter pulse oximeter devices were in short supply. Yet, no study to date has examined or scoped the state of privacy policies and notices for the top-rated and most downloaded pulse oximeter apps during COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine, through a high-level qualitative assessment, the state and nature of privacy policies for the downloaded and top-rated pulse oximeter apps during the COVID-19 pandemic to (1) compare findings against comparable research involving other mobile health (mHealth) apps and (2) begin discussions on opportunities for future research or investigation. METHODS: During August-October 2020, privacy policies were reviewed for pulse oximeter apps that had either at least 500 downloads (Google Play Store apps only) or a three out of five-star rating (Apple Store apps only). In addition to determining if the apps had an accessible privacy policy, other key privacy policyCrelated details that were extracted included, but were not limited to, app developer location (country); whether the app was free or required paid use/subscription; whether an ads disclosure was provided on the apps site; the scope of personal data collected; proportionality, fundamental rights, and data protection and privacy issues; and privacy safeguards. RESULTS: Six pulse oximeter apps met the inclusion criteria and only 33% (n=2) of the six apps had an accessible privacy policy that was specific to the pulse oximeter app feature (vs the app developers website or at all). Variation was found in both the regulatory nature and data privacy protections offered by pulse oximeter apps, with notable privacy protection limitations and gaps, although each app provided at least some information about the scope of personal data collected upon installing the app. CONCLUSIONS: Pulse oximeter app developers should invest in offering stronger privacy protections for their app users, and should provide more accessible and transparent privacy policies. This is a necessary first step to ensure that the data privacy of mHealth consumers is not exploited during public health emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where over-the-counter personal health monitoring devices could be in short supply and patients and consumers may, as a result, turn to mHealth apps to fill such supply gaps. Future research considerations and recommendations are also suggested for mHealth technology and privacy researchers who are interested in examining privacy implications associated with the use of pulse oximeter apps during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Pulse Oximeter App Privacy Policies During COVID-19: Scoping Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Detection of early onset colorectal cancer is challenging, and remains a rare diagnosis amongst younger people with gastrointestinal symptoms. We investigated whether the faecal immunochemical test (FIT) could identify younger patients at higher risk of colorectal cancer or serious bowel disease including colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or advanced adenomas. METHODS A subgroup analysis was performed of symptomatic patients under 50 years of age (<50) from the NICE FIT study, a multicentre, prospective diagnostic accuracy study of FIT conducted between October 2017 and December 2019. The diagnostic accuracy of FIT for colorectal cancer and serious bowel disease was investigated in younger patients at different faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) cut-offs of 2, 10 and 150 g blood/g faeces (g/g). RESULTS Early onset colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 1.5% (16/1103) of younger symptomatic patients. The sensitivity of FIT for younger patients aged <50 was 87.5% (95% confidence interval 61.7-98.4%), 81.3% (54.4-96.0%) and 68.8% (41.3-89.0%) at f-Hb cut-offs of 2, 10 and 150 g/g, respectively. The positive predictive value for colorectal cancer increased from 4.2% (2.3-6.9%), to 11.5% (5.9-19.6%) at cut-offs of 2 and 150 g/g, while the positive predictive value for serious bowel disease increased from 31.3% (26.3-36.5%) to 65.6% (55.2-75.0%) at the same cut-offs. The negative predictive value of FIT for colorectal cancer remained above 99.5% at all cut-offs. CONCLUSION Detectable f-Hb on FIT in symptomatic younger patients may indicate referral for investigation of colorectal cancer and serious bowel disease.","output":"Finding the needle in the haystack; the diagnostic accuracy of the faecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer in younger symptomatic patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Facing the world wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a new fitting method (QDF, quasi-distribution fitting) which could be used to analyze the data of COVID-19 is developed based on piecewise quasi-uniform B-spline curves.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty consecutive cases of MILESS-PN performed between April 2013 and November 2015 were included in this study. Mini-laparoendoscopic single-site surgery consisted of the simultaneous use of two 3-mm pararectal trocars and an umbilical SILS trocar; the sequence of steps of MILESS-PN was comparable with standard laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. Demographic data and the main perioperative and oncological outcome parameters were gathered and analyzed. RESULTS The median operative time was 134.6 (interquartile range [IQR] 110-180) minutes with a median warm ischemia time of 12.1 (IQR 9.5-15.5) minutes. Postoperatively, 4 early complications were recorded and the median hospital stay was 4.2 (IQR 3.5-6.0) days. The median renal tumor size was 3.6 (IQR 2.4-5.3) cm with a median PADUA score of 8.3 (IQR 8-9). The definitive pathologic results revealed a renal cell carcinoma in 32 cases (80%), an angiomyolipoma in 3 cases (7.5%), and an oncocytoma in 5 cases (12.5%). All tumors were removed with negative surgical margins, and at the median follow-up of 34.5 (IQR 24-48) months, all patients were alive without evidence of tumor recurrence or port-site metastasis. A statistically significant decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed postoperatively (postoperative vs preoperative median eGFR: 87.6 [IQR 70.4-101.8] and 104.7 [IQR 82.7-123.3], P <.0001) and at 6 months (6 months vs preoperative eGFR 93.6 [IQR 79.1-110.2] and 104.7 [IQR 82.7-123.3], P <.0001). CONCLUSION MILESS-PN for renal tumors with an intermediate PADUA score in well-selected patients is not associated with increased risks for the patients, presenting excellent oncological and functional results at the midterm follow-up.

This study assessed an initiative to train providers at school-based health centers (SBHCs) to offer students the full range of contraceptive methods. DESIGN: Surveys were administered at baseline pre-training and at follow-up three months post-training. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations for clustered data to examine clinical practice changes. SETTING: Eleven contraceptive trainings across the US from 2016-2019 PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred-sixty providers from 158 SBHCs serving 135,800 students INTERVENTIONS: On-site training to strengthen patient-centered counseling and equip practitioners to integrate IUDs and implants into contraceptive services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes included counseling experience on IUDs and implants, knowledge of patient eligibility, and clinician method skills. RESULTS: At follow-up, providers were significantly more likely to report having enough experience to counsel on IUDs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62-6.36]) and implants (aOR: 3.06; 95% CI, 2.05 - 4.57).

Patients with hematologic malignancies may have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, due to immunosuppression related to the underlying disease and its treatment. In the absence of specific data, potential risk factors for severe events of COVID-19 should be considered as for other community acquired respiratory virus (CARV) infections: >60 years, severe immunodeficiency, chemotherapy treatment. We present three patients with Szary syndrome (SS) and COVID-19 infection. Objective: We aim to report the outcome of COVID-19 in patients with SS treated at the department of Dermatology of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires. Methods and material: Patients with SS who were diagnosed positive for COVID19 infection, during worldwide pandemic in 2020. We collected retrospectively clinical data, SS evolution and treatment response. Case 1: A 58-year-old male with hypertension was diagnosed with SS stage IVA1 in July 2014, he received multiple systemic treatments such as extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), IFN 2b, bexarotene, with partial response (PR) and eventually stable disease. In August 2020, he was hospitalized due to fever, dry cough and progressive cutaneous disease. SARS-CoV2 was confirmed, requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory (IMV) in the ICU and systemic corticosteroids. The clinical course improved with complete response (CR) of cutaneous disease and persistence of hematologic involvement. He was discharged 3 months later with no SARS-CoV-2 sequels. Case 2: A 66-year-old female with breast cancer in 2002 treated with RT and tamoxifeno was diagnosed with SS stage IVA1 in March 2012. She was treated with IFN 2b, TSEB, vorinostat and ECP with CR, relapse and then PR. In November 2020 she started chemotherapy due to cutaneous and nodal progression. A month later, she required hospitalisation and IMV due to dry cough and respiratory distress, SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed. She died 7 days later due to progression of respiratory distress. Case 3: An 86-year-old male with arterial hypertension was diagnosed with SS stage IVA1 in March 2017. He received ECP, methotrexate, with PR. In February 2021 he was hospitalized due to dry cough, headache with cutaneous disease relapse. Laboratory parameters showed pre-existing lymphopenia. SARS CoV-2 was confirmed. He was admitted to the ICU requiring IMV due to respiratory distress, and died 15 days after. Conclusions: Among our patients, two had several associated comorbidities and risk factors for a severe event of COVID-19, besides case 3 presented pre-existing lymphopenia at presentation.

At our Trust, there was a 46% reduction in PED attendances in 2020 compared to the same two-month period in 2019 (6631 v 12092).ObjectivesThe study aims were to analyse the impact of lockdown on PED attendance in our Trust, identify reasons for reduced attendance, drivers of change in behaviour, the clinical conditions, timing, and outcomes of PED attendees.MethodsThis quantitative sub-study was part of a prospective mixed methods study that recruited caregivers of children 16 years attending PEDs in our Trust during November-December 2020. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data including demographics, details on reason for attendance, source and type of advice sought prior to attendance, the form of transport used to get to PED and clinical outcomes of the attendees. Likert scales were used to assess fears and drivers of change in behaviour around PED attendance. We used frequencies, proportions and Spearmans correlation coefficient to summarize the data. Likert scale data was analysed using measures of central tendency (median) and dispersion (interquartile range).ResultsA total of 98 caregivers who attended PED with their children during the study period were recruited randomly. Most participants were female (79.6%). About 92% of the participants disclosed their ethnicity: with 57/90 (63%) were white, 19(21%) identified as black and 14(16%) were other races including people of Asian and Hispanic descent.Over 60% of participants came to PED within 2 days of illness, with mode of transport being: by ambulance (13%), drove their own cars (59%) and used public transport (13%). The commonest clinical presentation was injuries 29/98 (30%), followed by respiratory conditions 11/98 (11%). A total of 76 (78%) were discharged while 17(17%) were admitted.The main concerns related to PED attendance were;risk of contracting COVID-19(41%);and concerned about overburdening the NHS (25%). Just under half, 42/98 (43%), of participants stated that they would have attended PED in the same time frame as they did in contrast to 32/98 (32.6%) of those who felt they would have attended earlier if there was no pandemic. Whilst 22/98 (22.4%) were not worried about attending PED at all. There was no correlation between self-rated level of worry about coming to PED and time taken to PED attendance (spearman correlation co-efficient = 0.1399)Most participants 60/98(61.2%) discussed their childs illness with another person prior to presentation. 5/98 (5.1%) of the participants were advised not come to ED but they decided to attend anyway. 28/98 (28.6%) participants contacted GPs followed by 19/98 (19%) who consulted the NHS 111 service.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that in line with national figures, PED attendances fell dramatically during the Covid pandemic, especially in the area of respiratory illness. For the carers who brought their children to the PED, there was a high level of concern about safety and infection control for themselves and their children that needs to be addressed.","output":"Parental perceptions of paediatric emergency departmental attendance in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK (PPEDiC).

Many COVID-19 infected people are asymptomatic or experience moderate symptoms and recover without medical intervention. However, older people and those with comorbid hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or heart disease are at higher risk of mortality. Because current therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients are limited specifically for this elderly population at risk, Biophytis is developing BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone, a Mas receptor activator) as a new treatment option for managing patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the severe stage. The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV2 spike protein seems to alter the function of ACE2, a key player in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The clinical picture of COVID-19 includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiomyopathy, multiorgan dysfunction and shock, all of which might result from an imbalance of the RAS. We propose that RAS balance could be restored in COVID-19 patients through MasR activation downstream of ACE2 activity, with 20-hydroxyecdysone (BIO101) a non-peptidic Mas receptor (MasR) activator. Indeed, MasR activation by 20-hydroxyecdysone harbours anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-fibrotic properties. BIO101, a 97% pharmaceutical grade 20-hydroxyecdysone could then offer a new therapeutic option by improving the respiratory function and ultimately promoting survival in COVID-19 patients that develop severe forms of this devastating disease. Therefore, the objective of this COVA study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BIO101, whose active principle is 20-hydroxyecdysone, in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, group sequential and adaptive which will be conducted in 2 parts.

Follow-up of participants discharged from hospital will be performed through post-intervention phone calls at 14 ( 2) and 60 ( 4) days. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Two treatment arms will be tested in this study: interventional arm 350 mg b.i.d. of BIO101 (AP 20-hydroxyecdysone) and placebo comparator arm 350 mg b.i.d of placebo. Administration of daily dose is the same throughout the whole treatment period. Participants will receive the study medication while hospitalized for up to 28 days or until a clinical endpoint is reached (i.e., negative or positive event). Participants who are officially discharged from hospital care will no longer receive study medication. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary study endpoint: The proportion of participants with negative events up to 28 days. Requiring mechanical ventilation (including cases that will not be intubated due to resource restrictions and triage). Requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Requiring high-flow oxygen defined as delivery of oxygen at a flow of 16 L/min. Only if the primary endpoint is significant at the primary final analysis the following Proportion of participants with events of respiratory failure at Day 28. Proportion of participants with positive events at Day 28. Proportion of participants with events of all-cause mortality at Day 28. A positive event is defined as the official discharge from hospital care by the department due to improvement in participant condition. Secondary and exploratory endpoints: In addition, a variety of functional measures and biomarkers (including the SpO2 / FiO2 ratio, viral load and markers related to inflammation, muscles, tissue and the RAS / MAS pathways) will also be collected. RANDOMIZATION: In part 1, randomization will be stratified by RAS pathway modulator use (yes/no) and co-morbidities (none vs. 1 and above). In Part 2, randomization will be stratified by centre, gender, RAS pathway modulator use (yes/no), co-morbidities (none vs. 1 and above), receiving Continuous Positive Airway Pressure/Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP/BiPAP) at study entry (Yes/No) and suspicion of COVID-19 related myocarditis or pericarditis (present or not).

One of the policies made by the Indonesian government is the implementation of PSBB (Large-Scale Social Restrictions) in several affected areas. The impact of the application is none other than attacking various sectors of life especially on the speed of state finances which are experiencing a decline. Therefore, the presence of the New Normal as a post-PSBB transition is used as an opening door for the tourism sector in helping to stabilize state finances. Because the tourism sector is one of the mainstays in generating foreign exchange. Therefore, in this paper two formulations of the problem are taken namely First, what is the role of the tourism sector in stabilizing state finances? Second, what is the strategy carried out by the government in opening a new normal as a post-PSSB transition in the tourism sector? The research method in this writing is done by using normative juridical research. The purpose of this paper is to find out the role of the tourism sector in stabilizing state finances in the COVID-19 era.

Salah satu kebijakan yang dilakukan pemerintah Indonesia adalah pemberlakuan PSBB (Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar) di beberapa daerah terdampak. Dampak dari penerapan tersebut tak lain menyerang berbagai sektor kehidupan, terutama pada kecepatan keuangan negara yang sedang mengalami penurunan. Oleh karena itu, kehadiran New Normal sebagai transisi pasca PSBB dijadikan sebagai pintu pembuka bagi sektor pariwisata dalam membantu menstabilkan keuangan negara. Pasalnya, sektor pariwisata merupakan salah satu andalan dalam menghasilkan devisa negara. Oleh karena itu, dalam tulisan ini diambil dua rumusan masalah yaitu Pertama, apa peran sektor pariwisata dalam menstabilkan keuangan negara? Kedua, bagaimana strategi yang dilakukan pemerintah dalam membuka new normal sebagai transisi pasca PSSB di sektor pariwisata? Metode penelitian dalam penulisan ini dilakukan dengan menggunakan penelitian yuridis normatif.

These newer imaging techniques are not more effective in standard surveillance of patients with BO because the prevalence of early neoplasia is low and HD-WLE with random biopsy analysis detects most cases of neoplasia. The evaluation and treatment of patients with BO and early-stage neoplasia should be centralized in tertiary referral centers, where procedures are performed under optimal conditions, by expert endoscopists. Lesions that require resection are almost always detected by HD-WLE, although advanced imaging techniques can detect additional flat lesions. However, these are of limited clinical significance because they are effectively eradicated by ablation therapy. No endoscopic imaging technique can reliably assess submucosal or lymphangio-invasion. Endoscopic resection of early-stage neoplasia in patients with BO is important for staging and management. Optical chromoendoscopy can also be used to evaluate lesions before endoscopic resection and in follow-up after successful ablation therapy.","output":"Diagnosis by endoscopy and advanced imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed serious restrictions for academic institutions to maintain their research and teaching practical subjects.

Although such approaches have enabled delivering the theoretical content of courses during the pandemic, universities have faced serious difficulties in running practicals with actual research experiments and teaching hand-on skills because such activities potentially override the required safety guidelines. Here, we report an adaptive measure, implemented at Monash University, to run home-based studies in cognitive neuroscience and achieve learning objectives, which are normally delivered in face-to-face practicals. We introduce two specifically designed short-term research projects and describe how different aspects of these projects, such as tutorials, experiments, and assessments, were modified to meet the required social distancing. The results of cognitive tests were closely comparable between the laboratory-based and home-based experiments indicating that students followed the guidelines and the required procedures for a reliable data collection.

However, a universally effective treatment regimen has not been developed to date. The main protease (Mpro), a key enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, plays a crucial role in the replication and transcription of this virus in cells and has become the ideal target for rational antiviral drug design. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations three times for these complexes of Mpro (monomeric and dimeric) and nine potential drugs that have a certain effect on the treatment of COVID-19 to explore their binding mechanism. In addition, a total of 12 methods for calculating binding free energy were employed to determine the optimal drug. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine consistently showed an outstanding binding ability to monomeric Mpro under various methods. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir presented the best performance when binding to a dimer, which was independent of the protonated state of Hie41 (protonated at N?) and Hid41 (protonated at N?), and these findings suggest that Chloroquine may not effectively inhibit the activity of dimeric Mproin vivo. Furthermore, three common hot-spot residues of Met165, Hie41, and Gln189 of monomeric Mpro systems dominated the binding of Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine. In dimeric Mpro, Gln189, Met165, and Met49 contributed significantly to binding with Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir; therefore, Gln189 and Met165 might serve as the focus in the discovery and development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. In addition, the van der Waals interaction played a significant role in the binding process, and the benzene ring of the drugs showed an apparent inhibitory effect on the normal function of Mpro. The binding cavity had great flexibility to accommodate these different drugs. The results would be notably helpful for enabling a detailed understanding of the binding mechanisms for these important drug-Mpro interactions and provide valuable guidance for the design of potent inhibitors.","output":"Inhibition mechanism and hot-spot prediction of nine potential drugs for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by large-scale molecular dynamic simulations combined with accurate binding free energy calculations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discussed Real-time Forecasting of the COVID-19 Epidemic using daily cumulative cases of COVID-19 in South Sulawesi Our aim is to make model for the growth of COVID-19 cases in South Sulawesi in the top 5 provinces with the largest COVID-19 cases in Indonesia and predict when this pandemic reaches the peak of spread and when it ends This paper used the Richards model, which is an extension of a simple logistic growth model with additional scaling parameters Data used in the paper as of June 24, 2020 were taken from the official website of the Indonesian government Our results are that the maximum cumulative number of COVID-19 cases has reached 10,000 to 12,000 cases The peak of the pandemic is estimated to occur from June to July 2020 while continuing to impose social restrictions The condition in South Sulawesi shows a sloping curve around October 2020, which means that there are still additional cases but not significant When entering November, the curve starts to flat which indicates the addition of very small cases until the pandemic ends The results of the pandemic peak prediction are the same as the Indonesian data;what is different is the prediction of when the pandemic will end In the best-case scenario, the current data will tend to slow down, with the COVID-19 pandemic in South Sulawesi expected to end in November 2020 Our modeling procedure can provide information about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in South Sulawesi that may facilitate real-time public health responses about future disease outbreaks ? 2020 Tim Pengembang Jurnal UPI","output":"Real-time forecasting of the COVID-19 epidemic using the richards model in South Sulawesi, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting healthcare services worldwide We investigated the impact of a strict lockdown policy on the characteristics of neonatal and pediatric attendances to our pediatric emergency department (PED) The clinical features of PED visits in March-April 2020 (COVID-19) and March-April 2019 (non-COVID-19) were analyzed During the COVID-19 lockdown period, visits reduced by 67%, from 3159 to 1039 Neonatal access decreased from 78 to 59, mainly due to fewer pathological conditions, with a complete disappearance of respiratory infections On the other hand, minor neonatal clinical conditions rose from 44 (56 4%) to 48 (81 4%), mostly due to feeding-related issues Communicable diseases, particularly respiratory infections and gastroenteritis, dropped from 1552 (49 1%) to 288 (27 7%) Accident-related visits also decreased during COVID-19, from 535 (16 9%) to 309 (29 7%), becoming the most common cause of PED access Hospital admissions reduced from 266 to 109, while PICU (pediatric intensive care unit) admissions decreased from 27 to 11, with a comparable rate of 10 1% in both periods The lockdown due to COVID-19 had a substantial impact on our PED visits, which markedly decreased, mainly due to fewer respiratory infections Unexpectedly, neonatal visits for minor conditions did not decline, but rather slightly increased Among the children admitted to the PICU, none had respiratory disease","output":"Neonatal and Pediatric Emergency Room Visits in a Tertiary Center during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a virus that is still related to the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) which still has an RNA chain that mutates faster than DNA.

In paediatric orthopaedics it has been applied in the pre-operative and intra-operative stages, allowing complex deformities to be replicated and patient-specific instrumentation to be used. This systematic review analyses the literature on the effect of 3D printing on paediatric orthopaedic osteotomy outcomes.A systematic review of several databases was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies evaluating the use of 3D printing technology in orthopaedic osteotomy procedures in children (aged  16 years) were included. Spinal and bone tumour surgery were excluded. Data extracted included demographics, disease pathology, target bone, type of technology, imaging modality used, qualitative/quantitative outcomes and follow-up. Articles were further categorized as either 'pre-operative' or 'intra-operative' applications of the technology.Twenty-two articles fitting the inclusion criteria were included. The reported studies included 212 patients. There were five articles of level of evidence 3 and 17 level 4.A large variety of outcomes were reported with the most commonly used being operating time, fluoroscopic exposure and intra-operative blood loss.A significant difference in operative time, fluoroscopic exposure, blood loss and angular correction was found in the 'intra-operative' application group. No significant difference was found in the 'pre-operative' category.Despite a relatively low evidence base pool of studies, our aggregate data demonstrate a benefit of 3D printing technology in various deformity correction applications, especially when used in the 'intra-operative' setting.

STUDY DESIGN: In our study, we have evaluated an in-house developed ELISA for the detection of the immunoglobulin classes A, G and M directed against the full-length spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2. For this analysis, we have included 110 sera from patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms or blood donors without symptoms collected at the Austrian Red Cross, Blood Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Linz. In addition, we have selected four commercially available IgG-based ELISAs as well as one IgA/IgG-based ELISA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as a multiplexed IgG-based micro-ELISA assay developed for rapid Point of Care testing applications. CONCLUSIONS: All assays evaluated in the course of this study demonstrated suitable sensitivity and specificity values for the identification of patients that have experienced a past infection with SARS-CoV-2.

This Amsterdam Colorectal Liver Met Registry (AmCORE) based study included 520 patients, 774 procedures, and 2101 tumors undergoing local treatment (resection and/or thermal ablation) from 2000 to 2021. Outcomes following local treatment were analyzed for primary tumor sidedness of CRC, RAS, and BRAF mutations and MSI status. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS), local control (LC), distant progression-free survival (DPFS), and overall survival (OS). Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed based on Cox proportional hazards model. The chi-square test was used to analyze complications. Complications (p = 0.485), OS (p = 0.252), LTPFS (p = 0.939), and LC (p = 0.423) was not associated with tumor-sidedness. Compared to right-sided colon cancer (CC) (reference HR 1.000), DPFS was superior for left-sided CC and rectal cancer (p = 0.018) with an HR for left-sided CC of 0.742 (95% CI, 0.596-0.923) and for RC of 0.760 (95% CI, 0.597-0.966). Regarding RAS mutations, no significant difference was found in OS (p = 0.116). DPFS (p = 0.001), LTPFS (p = 0.039), and LC (p = 0.025) were significantly lower in the RAS mutation group. Though no difference in LTPFS was found between RAS wildtype and RAS mutated CRLM following resection (p = 0.532), LTPFS was worse for RAS mutated tumors compared to RAS wildtype following thermal ablation (p = 0.037). OS was significantly lower in the BRAF mutation group (p < 0.001) and in the MSI group (p < 0.001) following local treatment, while both did not affect DPFS, LTPFS, and LC. This AmCORE based study suggests the necessity of wider margins to reduce LTP rates in patients with RAS mutated CRLM, especially for thermal ablation.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Pediatric and general adult academic medical centers and a Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: OHNS cases from March 18 to April 8, 2020-the 3 weeks immediately following the Ohio state-mandated suspension of all elective surgery on March 18, 2020-were compared with a 2019 control data set. RESULTS: During this time, OHNS at the general adult and pediatric medical centers and CCC experienced 87.8%, 77.1%, and 32% decreases in surgical procedures as compared with 2019, respectively. Aerosol-generating procedures accounted for 86.8% of general adult cases, 92.4% of pediatric cases, and 62.0% of CCC cases. Preoperative COVID-19 testing occurred in 7.1% of general adult, 9% of pediatric, and 6.9% of CCC cases. The majority of procedures were tiers 3a and 3b per the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Aerosol-protective personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn in 28.6% of general adult, 90% of pediatric, and 15.5% of CCC cases. CONCLUSION: For OHNS, the majority of essential surgical cases remained high-risk aerosol-generating procedures. Preoperative COVID-19 testing and intraoperative PPE usage were initially inconsistent; systemwide guidelines were developed rapidly but lagged behind recommendations of the OHNS department and its academy.

Risk representations are the cognitive responses a person holds about illness risk such as, identity (i.e., label/characteristics of risk), cause (i.e., factors causing condition), timeline (i.e., onset/duration of risk), consequences (i.e., intrapersonal/interpersonal outcomes), behavioral efficacy (i.e., if and how the condition can be controlled/treated), and illness risk coherence (i.e., extent to which representations, behaviors, and beliefs are congruent). The current study applies the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM-SR) to evaluate how risk representations may relate to COVID-19 protective and risk behaviors. METHODS: Participants include 400 workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk aged &#8805; 18 years and US residents. Participants completed an online survey measuring risk representations (B-IPQ) and COVID-19 related behaviors, specifically, physical distancing, hand washing, and shopping frequency. RESULTS: Risk coherence, consequences, timeline, emotional representation, and behavioral efficacy were related to risk and protective behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Risk representations vary in their relationship to COVID-19 risk and protective behaviors. Implications include the importance of coherent, targeted, consistent health communication, and effective health policy in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.","output":"The Role of Risk Perceptions and Affective Consequences in COVID-19 Protective Behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article COVID-19 coronavirus: recommended personal protective equipment for the orthopaedic and trauma surgeon, written.","output":"Correction to: COVID-19 coronavirus: recommended personal protective equipment for the orthopaedic and trauma surgeon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is no prior study of the effect of mobility-limiting measures on the occurrence of COVID-19 in Iraq. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between publicly available mobility index data and the growth ratio (GR) of COVID-19. METHOD: We used Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports to extract Iraqs mobility data and the official Ministry of Health COVID-19 statements. We used the data to calculate the Pearsons correlation coefficient and fit a linear regression model to determine the relationship between percentage change from the baseline in the mobility indices and the GR of COVID-19 in Iraq. RESULTS: There was a moderate positive correlation between each of the mobility indices except the residential index and COVID-19 GR in Iraq. The general linear model indicated that as each of the mobility indices increases by one unit, the GR of COVID19 increases by 0.002C0.003 except for the residential index. As the residential mobility index increases by one unit, the GR decreases by 0.009. All the findings were statistically significant (P-value < 0.0001).

Its genomic surveillance is important in cities with millions of inhabitants and an economic center, such as Mexico City. Results. From 16 November to 31 December 2021, we observed an increase of 88% in Omicron prevalence in Mexico City. We explored the R346K substitution, prevalent in 42% of Omicron variants, known to be associated with immune escape by monoclonal antibodies. In a phylogenetic analysis, we found several independent exchanges between Mexico and the world, and there was an event followed by local transmission that gave rise to most of the Omicron diversity in Mexico City. A haplotype analysis revealed that there was no association between haplotype and vaccination status. Among the 66% of patients who have been vaccinated, no reported comorbidities were associated with Omicron; the presence of odynophagia and the absence of dysgeusia were significant predictor symptoms for Omicron, and the RT-qPCR Ct values were lower for Omicron. Conclusions. Genomic surveillance is key to detecting the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a timely manner, even weeks before the onset of an infection wave, and can inform public health decisions and detect the spread of any mutation that may affect therapeutic efficacy.","output":"Early Genomic, Epidemiological, and Clinical Description of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant in Mexico City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring (RM) technology embedded in cardiac rhythm devices permits continuous monitoring of device function, and recording of selected cardiac physiological parameters and cardiac arrhythmias and may be of utmost utility during Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, when in-person office visit for regular follow-up were postponed. However, patients not alredy followed-up via RM represent a challenging group of patients to be managed during the lockdown. METHODS: We reviewed patient files scheduled for an outpatient visit between January 1, 2020 and May 11th, 2020 to assess the proportion of patients in whom RM activation was possible without office visit, and compared them to those scheduled for visit before the lockdown. RESULTS: During COVID-19 pandemic, RM activation was feasible in a minority of patients (7.8% of patients) expected at outpatient clinic for a follow-up visit and device check-up. This was possible in a good proportion of complex implantable devices such as cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter defibrillator but only in 3 patients with a pacemaker the RM function could be activated during the period of restricted access to hospital.

VCR can cause pulmonary fibrosis (PF), leading to respiratory failure. The transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts may play a key role in PF. The present study attempted to reveal the molecular mechanism of VCR-induced PF and the possible involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Methods: Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELFs) were treated with different concentrations of VCR. Inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK were added to HELFs. Cell proliferation state was assessed using cell counting kit-8 and by directly counting the number of cells. The expressions of vimentin and -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) were investigated using western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Activation of ERK and P38 was estimated by the expression of phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38), p38 MAPK, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and ERK1/2 using western blot analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to estimate the level of collagen I in cell culture supernatants. Results: Results showed that VCR promoted cellular proliferation, secretion of collagen I and the expression of vimentin and -SMA. High expression of p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 was associated with the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059 suppressed the expression of the above proteins. Conclusion: Our study revealed that VCR could promote the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts by regulating the MAPK signal pathway, which may be a promising way to treat VCR-induced PF.","output":"Vincristine Promotes Transdifferentiation of Fibroblasts Into Myofibroblasts via P38 and ERK Signal Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

We examine changes in young peoples mental health from before to during the initial and second more prolonged lockdown, and whether women and those with pre-existing depressive symptoms were disproportionally impacted. MethodsParticipants reported on mental health indicators in an ongoing 18-year data collection in the Danish National Birth Cohort and in a COVID-19 survey, including 8 data points: 7 in the initial lockdown, and 1 year post. Changes in quality of life (QoL), mental well-being, and loneliness were estimated with random effect linear regressions on longitudinal data (N=32,985), and linear regressions on repeated cross-sections (N=28,579). FindingsInterim deterioration in mental well-being and loneliness was observed during the initial lockdown, and only in those without pre-existing depressive symptoms. During the second lockdown, a modest deterioration was again observed for mental well-being and loneliness. QoL likewise only declined among those without pre-existing symptoms, where women showed a greater decline than men. QoL did not normalise during the initial lockdown and remained at lower levels during the second lockdown. These findings were not replicated in the repeated cross-sections. InterpretationExcept for an interim decrease in mental health during lockdown, and only in those without pre-existing depressive symptoms, this studys findings do not suggest a substantial detrimental impact of the lockdowns. Potential methodological differences in-between studies are a possible explanation for the mixed evidence. FundingThe Velux Foundation Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed, PsycINFO, MedrXiv, and PsyArXiv with the terms (\\"Mental*\\" OR \\"Psychological*\\" OR \\"Emotional*\\") AND (\\"Youth\\" OR \\"Young Adult*\\") AND (\\"COVID*\\" OR \\"Coronavirus\\" OR \\"Lockdown*\\") for articles published in English between January 1st 2020 and October 1st 2021. Included studies varied in terms of quality of data used but overall studies reported a detrimental impact of the lockdowns on young peoples mental health. However, the evidence on mental well-being and loneliness has shown to be inconsistent and with signs of resilience. Young people, women, and those with a pre-existing mental disorder have been identified as vulnerable subgroups, but only a few studies investigating mental health in individuals with a pre-existing mental disorder included a pre-lockdown measurement. The included studies also demonstrated that there is a gap in the evidence in understanding how mental health changed week by week, as well as the long-term impact over the course of the lockdowns. Added value of this studyWith longitudinal data, this study shows an interim impact of the initial and second lockdown on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in young individuals without pre-existing symptoms in Denmark. Since commencement of the initial lockdown, the levels of mental health returned to before levels, but one year after the initial lockdown, the levels were still lower than before lockdown in young people without pre-existing depressive symptoms. Young individuals with pre-existing depressive symptoms did not experience more detrimental impact of the lockdown, but rather indication of resilience or even improvements in mental health were observed. A disproportional impact of the lockdown on women compared to men was only observed for QoL, as women without pre-exiting depressive symptoms experienced a greater decline in QoL than men without pre-existing depressive symptoms. However, findings based on the repeated cross-sectional data did not show similar interim impact - but instead no - or clinically irrelevant impact. Thus, taken together our findings do not suggest a substantial lasting impact of the lockdowns on mental health among young individuals. Implications of all available evidenceA great majority of earlier studies suggest that the lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic have had substantial detrimental impact on mental health, and that women and those with a pre-existing mental disorder constitute vulnerable subgroups. However, these studies vary considerably in terms of method applied. Our findings emphasise the importance of the use of different data setups, as well as methodology applied for the investigation of mental health. More studies based on high-quality data used in different settings are needed to fully understand the impact of the lockdowns on young peoples mental health, including potential disproportional impact on vulnerable subgroups.","output":"The impact of the initial and 2nd national COVID-19 lockdown on mental health in young people with and without pre-existing depressive symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionCurrent estimates of pandemic spread using infectious disease models in Germany for SARS-CoV-2 often do not use age-specific infection parameters and are not always based on known contact matrices of the population. They also do not usually include setting-based information of reported cases and do not account for age-specific underdetection of reported cases. Here, we report likely pandemic spread using an age-structured model to understand the age- and setting-specific contribution of contacts to transmission during all phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. MethodsWe developed a deterministic SEIRS model using a pre-pandemic contact matrix. The model is optimized to fit reported age-specific SARS-CoV-2 incidences from the Robert Koch Institute, includes information on setting-specific reported cases in schools and integrates age and pandemic period-specific parameters for underdetection of reported cases deduced from a large population-based seroprevalence study. ResultsWe showed that taking underreporting into account, younger adults and teenagers are the main contributors to infections during the first three pandemic waves in Germany. Overall, the contribution of contacts in schools to the total cases in the population was below 10% during the third wave. DiscussionAccounting for the pandemic phase and age-specific underreporting seems important to correctly identify those parts of the population where quarantine, testing, vaccination, and contact-reduction measures are likely to be most effective and efficient.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, isolation area-stratified study collected demographic data, sleep status and emotional measurements from 1036 HPCD in 9 medical institutions from March 5 to 9, 2020 in Wuhan, China, which was the epicenter of the epidemic. HPCD who worked in isolation areas with COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. The severity of symptoms of sleep disorders, insomnia and emotional self-efficacy were assessed by the Chinese versions of the 10-item Self-rating sleeping situation scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index and the 12-item Regulatory emotional self-efficacy questionnaire, respectively. Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with sleep disturbances. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed via AMOS to explore the relationship among the four components. RESULTS: A total of 1036 out of 1075 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 96.4%. A total of 925 (89.3%) were aged 20 to 39 years, and 755 (72.9%) were women. Among all participants, 874 (84.4%) were nurses, and 162 (15.6%) were physicians; 538 (51.9%) worked in intensive care isolation units; 843 (81.4%) worked in isolation areas for 4 hours straight, and 395 (38.1%) perceived COVID-19 peer exposure. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of sleep disorders (543, 52.4%). Exposure status and length of work were the main factors affecting sleep status, which had indirect effects on sleep status by mediating regulatory emotional self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: In this survey of HPCD for patients with COVID-19 in China, participants reported experiencing sleep disturbance burdens, especially those having exposure experience and working long shifts. Regulatory emotional self-efficacy (RESE) is an important resource for alleviating sleep disturbances and improving sleep quality.

BACKGROUND: Utilization of remote monitoring platforms was recommended amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The HeartLogic algorithm combines data from multiple implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) sensors (first and third heart sounds, intrathoracic impedance, respirations, night heart rate, and patient activity) to provide integrated data that may allow for detection of early signs of worsening HF. PURPOSE: We examined whether the HeartLogic platform may elucidate behavioral changes that impact HF decompensation, and the possible consequences of home confinement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Italian lockdown was imposed from March 8th to May 18th. On March 8th 2020, the HeartLogic feature was active in 349 ICD and cardiac resynchronization therapy ICD patients at 20 Italian centers. The period from January 1st to July 19th was divided in 3 phases: Pre-Lockdown (weeks 1-11), Lockdown (weeks 12-20), Post-Lockdown (weeks 21-29). RESULTS: Immediately after the implementation of stay at home orders (week 12) we observed a significant drop in median activity level (65min [36-103] in week 12 vs. 101min [61-140] in Pre-Lockdown; p < 0.001), while there was no difference in the other contributing sensors. The median composite HeartLogic index increased at the end of Lockdown (4.7 [1.3-10.2] in week 20 vs. 2.5 [0.7-7.0] in Pre-Lockdown; p = 0.019). The weekly rate of HeartLogic alerts was significantly higher during Lockdown (1.56 alerts/week/100pts, 95%CI:1.15-2.06; IRR = 1.71, p = 0.014) and Post-Lockdown (1.37 alerts/week/100pts, 95%CI:0.99-1.84; IRR = 1.50, p = 0.072) than that reported in Pre-Lockdown (0.91 alerts/week/100pts, 95%CI:0.64-1.27). However, the median duration of alert state and the maximum index value did not change among phases, as well as the proportion of alerts followed by clinical actions at the centers (Pre-Lockdown: 31%, Lockdown: 22%, Post-Lockdown: 28%), and the proportion of alerts fully managed remotely (i.e. no in-clinic visits) (Pre-Lockdown: 89%, Lockdown: 90%, Post-Lockdown: 88%). CONCLUSIONS: The system was sensitive to the behavioral changes occurred during the lockdown, i.e. decrease in activity. However, the home confinement had no impact on the other sensors. The higher rate of HeartLogic alerts during lockdown and the increase in the median index after 8 weeks of home confinement suggest the worsening of the HF status, possibly explained by the behavioral changes. Nonetheless, the management of the HF detected events (actions performed and management strategy) was not impacted by the restrictions.","output":"Implantable cardioverter defibrillator multisensor monitoring during home confinement caused by the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is an acute, multisystem and toxin-mediated disease that usually causes shock and multiple organ failure in the early stages of its clinical course. It is associated with a substantial increase in mortality rate. The disease has been associated with invasive group A Streptococcus and is rarely caused by Streptococcus mitis (S. mitis). In healthy adults, S. mitis is closely related to endocarditis but rarely related to STSS. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of STSS caused by S. mitis in a healthy 45-year-old woman. She presented with fever 14 h after surgery and with hypotension 24 h later, and she subsequently suffered from septic shock, low albumin, dysfunction of coagulation, acute kidney dysfunction, respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and cellulitis of the incision. The diagnosis was obtained through clinical manifestation and blood culture examination. The patient was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, adequate antibiotics for a total of 4 weeks, respiratory support, and surgical debridement and drainage of the incision. She was discharged after her vital signs returned to normal and the incision healed on day 40 after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of STSS is often delayed or missed, which leads to a high mortality rate. It is possible to cure patients if the disease can be identified early and treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, adequate antibiotics and control of the source of infection.

We demonstrated that VitB6 can suppress LPS-induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation that lead to ferroptosis and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we found that VitB6 can regulate the expression of iron regulatory proteins, maintaining intracellular iron homeostasis. To confirm that VitB6 could inhibit LPS-induced ferroptosis and apoptosis, we pretreated mice with ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and emricasan that efficiently mimicked VitB6 pharmacological effects. This improved the survival rate of mice challenged with a high LPS dose. In addition, VitB6 regulated the expression of LPS-induced apoptosis-related proteins and iron regulatory proteins. It mediated the expression of Nrf2, transcription factor NF-E2Crelated factor 2, which promoted the expression of antioxidant enzymes and restrained LPS-induced ferroptosis and apoptosis.

For data gathering, the EE dimension of the Maslach Inventory for teachers was used, along with a TC questionnaire and the sociodemographic data of the participants. A binary logistical regression model was used for statistical analysis. Regarding TC, over 30% of teachers declared that they smoked; 65% of the teachers presented medium-high EE and 31% of teachers presented high EE. Teachers who said they were smokers had a greater risk of presenting high EE (OR: 1.7, p < 0.05), along with younger teachers (44 years; OR: 2.1, p < 0.01). In addition, teachers with high EE also have a high risk of TC. The present study reports an association between TC and high EE category among teachers, regardless of gender.

The present study is a pilot study aimed to compare non-mydriatic fundus photography with indirect ophthalmoscopy for its utilisation as a feasible and logistically convenient screening modality for DR in an older age, rural, tribal population in Western India. DESIGN AND SETTING: This community-based, cross-sectional, prospective population study was a part of a module using Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness and DR methodology in 8340 sampled participants with 50 years age. In this study, the diabetics identified were screened for DR using two methods: non-mydriatic fundus photography on the field by trained professionals, that were then graded by a retina specialist at the base hospital and indirect ophthalmoscopy by expert ophthalmologists in the field with masking of each others findings for its utility and comparison. RESULTS: The prevalence of DR, sight threatening DR and maculopathy using indirect ophthalmoscopy was found to be 12.1%, 2.1% and 6.6%, respectively. A fair agreement (=0.48 for DR and 0.59 for maculopathy) was observed between both the detection methods. The sensitivity and specificity of fundus photographic evaluation compared with indirect ophthalmoscopy were found to be 54.8% and 92.1% (for DR), 60.7% and 90.8% (for any DR) and 84.2% and 94.8% (for only maculopathy), respectively. CONCLUSION: Non-mydriatic fundus photography has the potential to identify DR (any retinopathy or maculopathy) in community settings in Indian population. Its utility as an affordable and logistically convenient cum practical modality is demonstrable. The sensitivity of this screening modality can be further increased by investing in better resolution cameras, capturing quality images and training and validation of imagers.

AIM We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine all-cause mortality and causes of death among PWH. METHODS We systematically searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane central register of controlled trials from inception through March 15, 2021. Studies that reported a mortality estimate of PWH compared with the general population and/or reported causes of death were included. Random-effects meta-analysis with inverse variance method was used to obtain pooled estimates. We stratified the analysis by the year of cohort entry (before 2000 vs after 2000). RESULT Of the 4769 studies identified, 52 met the eligibility criteria. The pooled all-cause standardized mortality ratio (SMR) from 9 studies in PWH was 1.93 (95% CI 1.38-2.70; I2 = 97%). The pooled SMRs before and after the year 2000 were 2.40 (95% CI 1.92-3.00; I2 = 87%) and 1.20 (95% CI 1.03-1.40; I2 = 62%), respectively. Before the year 2000, 31.2% deaths occurred due to HIV followed by haemorrhage (26.0%), cardiovascular disease (18.2%), liver disease (9.0%), and cancer (8.9%). Fewer (13.9%) deaths were attributable to HIV after the year 2000 with the proportion of deaths due to haemorrhage remaining unchanged. CONCLUSION With treatment advances, mortality in PWH has declined over the last few decades approaching that of the general population.

OBJECTIVE: We looked for attributes that correlated with satisfactory tele-encounters. METHODS: Eleven consultation-liaison attending surveys and 8 attendings' tele-encounter logs from March to June 2020 were completed and reviewed to assess for patient and provider characteristics associated with barriers to using telepsychiatry. RESULTS: A vast majority of 223 tele-psychiatric encounters were acceptable to providers in terms of technology (82%) and their ability to form a connection with the patient (78%). In multivariable logistic regression models, an unresolvable difficulty in using the platform was less common for female patients (odds ratio = 0.239, P = 0.002) and more common for patients who prefer a non-English language (odds ratio = 9.059, P < 0.001); achieving a personal connection that felt right was also less likely for patients who prefer a non-English language (odds ratio = 0.189, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry has previously been limited to outpatient use and, generally, for providers and patients who specifically preferred it.

In the present overview, evaluations of the perceived risk of selected transboundary animal diseases of pigs, as collated from the willing participants from the provincial veterinary services of South Africa, are presented. A scenario tree revealed that infected but undetected pigs were the greatest perceived threat. The provincial veterinary services, according to participants in the study, face certain difficulties, including the reporting of disease and the flow of disease information amongst farmers. Perceived strengths in surveillance and disease monitoring include the swiftness of sample despatch to the national testing laboratory, as well as the ease of flow of information between the provincial and national agricultural authorities. The four factors were identified that were perceived to most influence animal health-service delivery: transport, access, livestock policy and resources. African swine fever was perceived to be the most important pig disease in South Africa. Because the decentralisation of veterinary services in South Africa was identified as a potential weakness, it is recommended that national and provincial veterinary services need to work together and interdependently to achieve centrally controlled surveillance systems.

Three consecutive patients with heterotaxy syndrome and functional single ventricle complicated by infra-cardiac TAPVC treated with our own strategy were retrospectively studied. In two infants, DV stent placement was performed on the day of birth. In one case at 11 days of age. The risk of pulmonary vein obstruction was reduced, and on-pump surgery, including TAPVC repair, was performed on a standby basis. Since the rapid increase in hepatic enzymes occurred on postoperative day 0 to 1 in all cases, percutaneous stent occlusion was performed until postoperative day 3. The procedure improved liver function. One patient died due to severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation, one case underwent BCPS, and one patient was waiting to undergo. DV stent placement can avoid TAPVC repair in the early neonatal period. After TAPVC repair, the portosystemic shunt remained, resulting in hepatic dysfunction, but this could be improved by stent and vertical vein occlusion.

METHODS: From March 16 to April 30, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center were identified with laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by review of in-patient hospital records. RESULTS: We identified 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS, of which 9 had pediatric onset; 17 with progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). Thirty-seven underwent PCR testing and were confirmed positive. Of the entire group, 64 (84%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20 therapies (n = 34, 44.7%) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (n = 10, 13.5%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive disease, and a nonambulatory status.

However, prospective studies to assess objectively the feasibility and safety of RPD compared to open pancreatoduodenectomy (OPD) are currently lacking. METHODS/DESIGN The PORTAL trial is a multicenter randomized controlled, patient-blinded, parallel-group, phase III non-inferiority trial performed in seven high-volume centers for pancreatic and robotic surgery in China (> 20 RPD and > 100 OPD annually in each participating center). The trial is designed to enroll and randomly assign 244 patients with an indication for elective pancreatoduodenectomy for malignant periampullary and pancreatic lesions, as well as premalignant and symptomatic benign periampullary and pancreatic disease. The primary outcome is time to functional recovery postoperatively, measured in days. Secondary outcomes include postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as perioperative costs. A sub-cohort of 128 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will also be compared to assess the percentage of patients who undergo postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy within 8 weeks, in each arm. Secondary outcomes in this cohort will include patterns of disease recurrence, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. DISCUSSION The PORTAL trial is designed to assess the feasibility and safety of RPD compared to OPD, in terms of functional recovery as described previously.

The areas with its highest concentrations within the EU are these most populated and industrialised ones. Excessive nitrogen dioxide concentrations are responsible for around 75,000 premature deaths of EU residents each year;in Poland, this value reaches almost 1,900. Since 2017, there have been new possibi-lities to measure NO2 concentration, made as part of the Copernicus Sentinels-5P Programme. Hence, it is purposeful to analyse changes in nitrogen dioxide emissions in the most important Polish cities against the EU in spring and summer 2020. The basis for the analysis was satellite data collected during the Copernicus Sentinels-5P Programme. In 2020, there were huge changes in NO2 concentration, which were the consequences of the implementation of restrictive safety measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic: a significant reduction in road traffic and the closure or limiting of production in many industrial plants. It was found that, as a result of lockdown, nitrogen dioxide concentrations in Polands largest cities fell to a much lesser degree than in cities of similar size in southern or western Europe. The analyses indicated that data obtained from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite will play a key role in monitoring changes in nitrogen dioxide concentration throughout the EU. Ground-based observations of nitrogen dioxide concentrations, which have dominated until recently, will remain only of comparative importance in the assessment and analysis of the compound concentration. ? 2021, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study in patients receiving intensive care with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 ARDS. 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D serum levels, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell subsets were measured on admission as well as after 10-15 days. Clinical parameters were extracted from the patient data management system. Standard operating procedures included the daily administration of vitamin D3 via enteral feeding. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were eligible, of which 26 were included in this study as data on vitamin D status was available. 96% suffered from severe COVID-19 ARDS. All patients without prior vitamin D supplementation (n = 22) had deficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D but not did not increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels after 10-15 days.

A spontaneous HPV16 E6/E7-expressing oral tumor model in human HLA-A2 (AAD) transgenic mice will be important for the development of therapeutic HPV vaccines for the control of HPV-associated head and neck cancers. METHODS: In the current studies, we characterized the HLA-A2 restricted HPV16 E7-specific CD8 + T cell mediated immune responses in the HLA-A2 (AAD) transgenic mice using a therapeutic naked DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to a mutated E7(N53S). We also employed oncogenic DNA plasmids that encoded HPV16E6/E7/Luc, NRas(G12V), and sleeping beauty transposase for the transfection into the submucosal of oral cavity of the transgenic mice with electroporation to create a spontaneous oral tumor. Furthermore, we characterized the therapeutic antitumor effects of CRT/E7(N53S) DNA vaccine using the spontaneous HPV16 E6/E7-expressing oral tumor model in HLA-A2 (AAD) transgenic mice. RESULTS: We found that CRT/E7(N53S) DNA vaccine primarily generated human HPV16 E7 peptide (aa11-20) specific CD8 + T cells, as compared to the wild-type CRT/E7 vaccine, which primarily generated murine H-2D(b) restricted E7 peptide (aa49-57) specific CD8 + T cell responses. We also observed transfection of the oncogenic DNA plasmids with electroporation generated spontaneous oral tumor in all of the injected mice. Additionally, treatment with CRT/E7(N53S) DNA vaccine intramuscularly followed by electroporation resulted in significant antitumor effects against the spontaneous HPV16 E6/E7-expressing oral tumors in HLA-A2 (AAD) transgenic mice.

The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-ASIPP Risk Mitigation & Stratification (COVID-ARMS) Return to Practice Task Force in order to provide guidance for safe and strategic reopening. OBJECTIVES: The aims are to provide education and guidance for interventional pain specialists and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic that minimizes COVID-related morbidity while allowing a return to interventional pain care. METHODS: The methodology utilized included the development of objectives and key questions with utilization of trustworthy standards, appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest, as well as a panel of experts from various regions, specialities, and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification were reviewed. The principles of best evidence synthesis of available literature and grading for recommendations as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) typically utilized in ASIPP guideline preparation was not utilized in these guidelines due to limitations because of their lack of available literature on COVID-19, risk mitigation and stratification. These guidelines are considered evidence -- informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. RESULTS: Numerous risk factors have emerged that predispose patients to contracting COVID-19 and/or having a more severe course of the infection. COVID-19 may have mild symptoms, even be asymptomatic, or may be severe and life threatening. Older age and certain comorbidities, such as underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, have been associated with worse outcomes. In pain care, COVID-19 patients are a heterogeneous group with some individuals relatively healthy and having only a short course of manageable symptoms while others become critically ill. It is necessary to assess patients on a case-by-case basis and craft individualized care recommendations. A COVID-ARMS risk stratification tool was created to quickly and objectively assess patients. Interventional pain specialists and their patients may derive important benefits from evidence-informed risk stratification, protective strategies to prevent infection, and the gradual resumption of treatments and procedures to manage pain. LIMITATIONS: COVID-19 was an ongoing pandemic at the time during which these recommendations were developed. The pandemic has created a fluid situation in terms of evidence-informed guidance. As more and better evidence is gathered, these recommendations may be modified. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain patients require continuity of care but during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, steps must be taken to stratify risks and protect patients from possible infection to safeguard them from COVID-19-related illness and transmitting the disease to others. Pain specialists should optimize telemedicine encounters with their pain patients, be cognizant of risks of COVID-19 morbidity, and take steps to evaluate risk-benefit on a case-by-case basis.

CASE REPORT A 44-year-old previously healthy woman with a history of inter-state travel developed a flu-like illness, followed by acute, steadily progressive cognitive impairment. She was admitted in a comatose state after a first tonic-clonic seizure. Blood tests were non-informative. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was indicative of AHNE.

Data of 38,353 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior research were used. For movement behaviors, participants reported the frequency and duration of physical activity and daily time on TV viewing and computer/tablet use before and during the pandemic period. Participants also reported the frequency of loneliness, sadness (feeling sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety feelings (feeling worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period. Sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, country region, and time adhering to the quarantine were used as correlates. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression models for the data analysis. The prevalence of all movement behavior clusters increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cluster of all three unhealthy movement behaviors increased from 4.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.9-5.4) to 26.2% (95% CI: 24.8-27.7). Younger adults, people with higher academic achievement, not working or working at home, and those with higher time in quarantine presented higher clustering. People that increased one and two or three unhealthy movement behaviors were, respectively, more likely to present loneliness (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41 [95% CI: 1.21-1.65] and OR = 1.71 [95% CI: 1.42-2.07]), sadness (OR = 1.25 [95% CI: 1.06-1.48] and OR = 1.73 [95% CI: 1.42-2.10]), and anxiety (OR = 1.34 [95% CI: 1.13-1.57] and OR = 1.78 [95% CI: 1.46-2.17]) during the COVID-19 quarantine.

A therapeutic antibody against the viral envelope (E) protein represents a promising immunotherapy for disease control. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We generated seventeen novel mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high reactivity against E protein of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). The mAbs were further dissected using recombinant E protein domain I-II (E-DI-II) and III (E-DIII) of DENV-2. Using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and mouse protection assay with lethal doses of DENV-2, we identified four serotype-specific mAbs that had high neutralizing activity against DENV-2 infection. Of the four, E-DIII targeting mAb DB32-6 was the strongest neutralizing mAb against diverse DENV-2 strains. Using phage display and virus-like particles (VLPs) we found that residue K310 in the E-DIII A-strand was key to mAb DB32-6 binding E-DIII. We successfully converted DB32-6 to a humanized version that retained potency for the neutralization of DENV-2 and did not enhance the viral infection. The DB32-6 showed therapeutic efficacy against mortality induced by different strains of DENV-2 in two mouse models even in post-exposure trials. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We used novel epitope mapping strategies, by combining phage display with VLPs, to identify the important A-strand epitopes with strong neutralizing activity. This study introduced potential therapeutic antibodies that might be capable of providing broad protection against diverse DENV-2 infections without enhancing activity in humans.","output":"Development of a Humanized Antibody with High Therapeutic Potential against Dengue Virus Type 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Isoflurane has shown better control of intensive care sedation than propofol or midazolam and seems to be a useful alternative. However, its effect on survival remains unclear. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to compare mortality after sedation with either isoflurane or propofol/midazolam. DESIGN A retrospective analysis of data in a hospital database for a cohort of consecutive patients. SETTING Sixteen-bed interdisciplinary surgical ICU of a German university hospital. PATIENTS Consecutive cohort of 369 critically ill surgical patients defined within the database of the hospital information system. All patients were continuously ventilated and sedated for more than 96 h between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. After excluding 169 patients (93 >79 years old, 10 <40 years old, 46 mixed sedation, 20 lost to follow-up), 200 patients were studied, 72 after isoflurane and 128 after propofol/midazolam. INTERVENTIONS Sedation with isoflurane using the AnaConDa system compared with intravenous sedation with propofol or midazolam. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hospital mortality (primary) and 365-day mortality (secondary) were compared with the Kaplan-Meier analysis and a log-rank test. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) [with 95% confidence interval (95% CI)] were calculated by logistic regression analyses to determine the risk of death after isoflurane sedation. RESULTS After sedation with isoflurane, the in-hospital mortality and 365-day mortality were significantly lower than after propofol/midazolam sedation: 40 versus 63% (P = 0.005) and 50 versus 70% (P = 0.013), respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders (coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute renal failure, creatinine, age and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), patients after isoflurane were at a lower risk of death during their hospital stay (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.68, P = 0.002) and within the first 365 days (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.81, P = 0.010).

This unknown coronavirus and the subsequent official announcement of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 alarmed the public and initiated the uptake of preventive measures. However, the manner in which the public responded to these announcements, and whether individuals from different provinces, responded similarly during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, remains unknown. To assess public reactions, we examined search interests during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. This study aimed to investigate how information seeking changed over time and how changes in information seeking varied across regions in China. <br><br>Methods: We used an interrupted time-series analysis to examine the Baidu Search Index and selected COVID-19 related terms associated with the COVID-19 derived exposure variables. We analyzed the search index daily using segmented log-normal regressions with data from Jan 1, 2017 to Mar 15, 2021, and derived relative risk (RR) estimates representing relative daily changes associated with exposure. Analyses were stratified by the provincial Human Index (HDI)- an area-level measure of socioeconomic status- and were conducted to assess regional heterogeneity in information-seeking responses. <br><br>Findings: Synchronous increases in COVID-19 related searches on the index were observed in the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in all provinces regardless of the number of confirmed cases. The most precipitous increase occurred in the week following the announcement of human-to-human transmission (Jan 18 to Jan 25 2020), when most provinces had activated their highest level of response to public health emergencies. Search patterns increased more as the HDI level increased, with a 1058 (95% CI: 991-1130), 1236 (95% CI: 1166 -1309) and 1243 (95% CI: 1155-1338) fold increase in regions with low, middle and high HDI, respectively. Searches on the index began to decline nationwide after the initiation of mass-scale lockdowns and travel restrictions, but statistically significant increases continued to occur in conjunction with the confirmation and report of major sporadic local outbreaks, including the outbreaks in Beijing (June, 2020), Qingdao (October, 2020) and Shijiazhuang (January, 2021). The relative increase in searches on the index was statistically significantly higher in regions with higher HDI in each outbreak. <br><br>Interpretation: Using search index data of nearly one billion internet users in China, we found that changes in the patterns of search interest in COVID-19 in each province of China occurred in a synchronous fashion during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and at the time of subsequent local outbreaks, irrespective of the location of the epicenter of each outbreak and the variation in pandemic severity across the country.

Family is an important place to shape personality traits, and people with different personalities will adopt different lifestyles, which will lead to variations in health outcomes. Therefore, this article aims to explore the relationship between health literacy and personality and its influencing factors in different family structures. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with 1,406 individuals. A questionnaire was utilized to measure health literacy, personality and demographic variables, including family structure. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were used to examine the relation between health literacy and personality traits between two types of family structure. RESULTS: CCA showed that the canonical correlation coefficients were 0.309 (p < 0.001) and 0.347 (p < 0.001), in two-parent family and single-parent family, respectively. The openness of personality traits exhibited the highest correlation with health literacy. Compared with the remaining personality traits, openness yielded the strongest effect ( = 0.485 and  = 0.830) in two types of family structure, respectively.

We report the outcomes of our early experience with SPA colorectal resections in comparison with CL surgery. METHODS We compared the following data, patient characteristics, operating time, morbidity, operative mortality, length of hospital stay and tumour variables, of patients who underwent SPA right, left, sigmoid and total colon resections, as well as high anterior resections and panproctocolectomies, with that of patients who underwent equivalent conventional laparoscopic (CL) operations. The 40 SPA and 78 CL patients studied underwent surgery between February 2008 and September 2011. RESULTS There was no difference between the SPA and CL operations, as regards the patient's sex (55.0 vs. 62.8% males, p = 0.411), comorbidity (ASA I 10.0 vs. 12.8%; ASA II 57.5 vs. 59.0%; ASA III 32.5 vs. 25.6%; ASA IV 0 vs. 2.6%, p = 0.722) and body mass index (26.2 vs. 28.0 kg/m(2), p = 0.073). However, SPA patients were younger (mean age 54.1 vs. 64.8 years, p = 0.001), and malignancy was a less common indication for surgery (25.0 vs. 71.8%, p < 0.001).

This study aims to assess the magnitude of psychological distress and associated factors among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large tertiary hospital located in north-east Italy. METHODS: All healthcare and administrative staff working in the Verona University Hospital (Veneto, Italy) during the COVID-19 pandemic were asked to complete a web-based survey from 21 April to 6 May 2020. Symptoms of post-traumatic distress, anxiety and depression were assessed, respectively, using the Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Personal socio-demographic information and job characteristics were also collected, including gender, age, living condition, having pre-existing psychological problems, occupation, length of working experience, hospital unit (ICUs and sub-intensive COVID-19 units vs. non-COVID-19 units). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with each of the three mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 2195 healthcare workers (36.9% of the overall hospital staff) participated in the study. Of the participants, 35.7% were nurses, 24.3% other healthcare staff, 16.4% residents, 13.9% physicians and 9.7% administrative staff. Nine per cent of healthcare staff worked in ICUs, 8% in sub-intensive COVID-19 units and 7.6% in other front-line services, while the remaining staff worked in hospital units not directly engaged with COVID-19 patients. Overall, 63.2% of participants reported COVID-related traumatic experiences at work and 53.8% (95% CI 51.0%-56.6%) showed symptoms of post-traumatic distress; moreover, 50.1% (95% CI 47.9%-52.3%) showed symptoms of clinically relevant anxiety and 26.6% (95% CI 24.7%-28.5%) symptoms of at least moderate depression. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that women, nurses, healthcare workers directly engaged with COVID-19 patients and those with pre-existing psychological problems were at increased risk of psychopathological consequences of the pandemic.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study METHODS: We conducted a survey of clinician-scientists in ophthalmology at U.S. academic institutions between April 17, 2019 and May 19, 2019. We collected information including 1) demographic data, 2) amount, type, and source of startup funding, first extramural grant, and first R01-equivalent independent grant, 3) starting and current salaries, and 4) Likert-scale measures of career satisfaction were analyzed using multivariate regression. RESULTS 98 clinician-scientists in ophthalmology were surveyed across different ages (mean 4811 years), research categories, institutional types, geographic regions, and academic ranks. Median startup funding was $50-99k, and median starting salary was $150-199k. Most investigators (67%) received their first extramural award from the National Eye Institute, mostly through K-award mechanisms (82%). The median time to receiving their first independent grant was 8 years, mostly through an R01 award (70%). Greater institutional startup support (P=0.027) and earlier extramural grant success (P=0.022) were associated with earlier independent funding. Male gender (P = 0.001) and MD degree (P=0.008) were associated with higher current salaries, but not starting salaries. Overall career satisfaction increased with career duration (P=0.011), but not with earlier independent funding (P=0.746) or higher income (P=0.300). CONCLUSIONS Success in research funding by clinician-scientists in ophthalmology may be linked to institutional support and earlier acquisition of extramural grants, but does not impact academic salaries.

Transthoracic esophagectomy is the preferred surgical approach worldwide allowing for en-bloc resection of the tumor with the surrounding lymph nodes. However, the percentage of cardiopulmonary complications associated with the transthoracic approach is high (50 to 70%).Recent studies have shown that robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy (RATE) is at least equivalent to the open transthoracic approach for esophageal cancer in terms of short-term oncological outcomes. RATE was accompanied with reduced blood loss, shorter ICU stay and improved lymph node retrieval compared with open esophagectomy, and the pulmonary complication rate, hospital stay and perioperative mortality were comparable. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy, risks, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of RATE as an alternative to open transthoracic esophagectomy for treatment of esophageal cancer. METHODS/DESIGN This is an investigator-initiated and investigator-driven monocenter randomized controlled parallel-group, superiority trial. All adult patients (age  18 and  80 years) with histologically proven, surgically resectable (cT1-4a, N0-3, M0) esophageal carcinoma of the intrathoracic esophagus and with European Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0, 1 or 2 will be assessed for eligibility and included after obtaining informed consent. Patients (n = 112) with resectable esophageal cancer are randomized in the outpatient department to either RATE (n = 56) or open three-stage transthoracic esophageal resection (n = 56). The primary outcome of this study is the percentage of overall complications (grade 2 and higher) as stated by the modified Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications. DISCUSSION This is the first randomized controlled trial designed to compare RATE with open transthoracic esophagectomy as surgical treatment for resectable esophageal cancer. If our hypothesis is proven correct, RATE will result in a lower percentage of postoperative complications, lower blood loss, and shorter hospital stay, but with at least similar oncologic outcomes and better postoperative quality of life compared with open transthoracic esophagectomy. The study started in January 2012. Follow-up will be 5 years. Short-term results will be analyzed and published after discharge of the last randomized patient.

Materials & Methods: Patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) or previously diagnosed with PCa were prospectively enrolled in this phase II trial. A combined uPAR PET, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) was performed and standardized uptake value (SUV) from primary tumor, as delineated by mpMRI, was measured by two independent readers. Correlation between SUV and Gleason score obtained by biopsy was assessed. Results: A total of 27 patients had histologically verified PCa visible on mpMRI and constituted the study population. There was a positive correlation between SUVmax and Gleason score (Spearman's rho= 0.55; P = 0.003). Receiver operating characteristics analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.67-1.00) in discriminating Gleason score 3+4 from 3+3. A cut-off for tumor SUVmax could be established with a sensitivity of 96% (79-99%) and specificity of 75% (30-95%) in detecting Gleason Scores 3+4. For discriminating Gleason score  4+3 vs.  3+4, a cut-off could be established for detecting Gleason score  4+3 with a sensitivity of 93% (69-99%) and specificity of 62% (36-82%). Conclusion: SUV measurements from uPAR PET in primary tumors as delineated by mpMRI showed a significant correlation with Gleason score, and tumor SUVmax was able to discriminate between low-risk and intermediate risk Gleason score profiles with high diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, uPAR PET/MRI could be a promising method for non-invasive evaluation of PCa, which may in the future potentially reduce the need for repeated biopsies, e.g. in active surveillance.","output":"Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (uPAR) PET/MRI of Prostate Cancer for Non-invasive Evaluation of Aggressiveness: a Prospective Phase II Clinical Trial Comparing with Gleason Score."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Healthcare workers (HCWs) employed in hospital settings frequently experience many occupational stressors leading to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Literature has increasingly highlighted PTSD as a major issue that involves both staff and healthcare organizations; the consequences of PTSD may include medication errors and lower standards of care. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses the need for preventing PTSD in HCWs working closely with COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the latest developments in assessing and managing the occupational risk of PTSD symptoms in hospital HCWs. METHODS: We searched for publications in MEDLINE/Pubmed using selected keywords. Each article was reviewed and categorized into one or more of the following four categories based on its subject matter: risk assessment, risk management and occurrence rates. RESULTS: Our search resulted in a total of 32 publications that matched our inclusion criteria. Increased years of service, older age, previous year exposure to violence, personality traits (i.e. neuroticism), history of mental disorders, being non-graduates, were found to be workers pre-trauma factors predicting PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest the need to prioritize preventative interventions aimed to anticipate the effects of traumatic exposure by training HCWs in evidence based anticipatory methods of coping with stressful events. With regard to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we found evidence of the need to strength social support and training targeted at psychological skills of medical staff who treated COVID-19 patients.

Whether the risk of VTE significantly differed between COVID-19 cohorts and non-COVID-19 cohorts with similar disease severity remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to compare the rate of VTE between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts with similar disease severity. METHODS: A systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Embase and Google Scholar) was conducted from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 to identify studies reporting VTE in COVID-19. Relative risks (RR) were estimated for the effect measure with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Seven studies (41,768 patients) evaluated VTE in COVID-19 cohorts compared to non-COVID-19 cohorts. The overall risk of VTE (RR 1.18; 95%CI 0.79C1.77; p = 0.42; I(2) = 54%), pulmonary embolism (RR 1.25; 95%CI 0.77C2.03; p = 0.36; I(2) = 52%) and deep venous thrombosis (RR 0.92; 95%CI 0.52C1.65; p = 0.78; I(2) = 0%) did not significantly differ between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts. However, subgroup analyses suggested an increased risk of VTE amongst CODID-19 versus non COVID-19 cohorts when only patients hospitalized within the intensive care unit (ICU) were considered (RR 3.10; 95%CI 1.54C6.23), which was not observed in cohorts of predominantly non-ICU patients (RR 0.95; 95%CI 0.81C1.11) (P(interaction) = 0.001). CONCLUSION: There was no signal for a difference in VTE in COVID-19 cohorts compared to non-COVID-19 cohorts, except for the subgroup of patients hospitalized in the ICU. These results should be viewed as exploratory and further studies are needed to confirm these results.","output":"Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 cohorts: A systematic review with meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pemerintah memberlakukan adanya pembatasan sosial atau kondisi menjaga jarak untuk mencegah penularan Coronavirus.

The rapid proliferation and infectivity of the virus can be attributed to many accumulating mutations in the spike protein leading to continuous generation of variants. The spike protein is a glycoprotein that recognizes and binds to cell surface receptor known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) leading to the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes and entry into the host cells. These circulating variants in the population have greatly impacted the virulence, transmissibility, and immunological evasion of the host. The present study is aimed at understanding the impact of the major mutations (L452R, T478K and N501Y) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and their consequences on the binding affinity to human ACE2 through protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. Protein-protein docking and Molecular mechanics with generalised Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) binding free energy analysis reveal that the spike mutants-L452R, T478K and N501Y have a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 as compared to the native spike protein. The increase in the number of interface residues, interface area and intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and non-bonded contacts corroborated with the increase in the binding affinity of the spike mutants to ACE2. Further, 75 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulation investigations show variations in the geometric properties such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), total solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and number of hydrogen bonds (NHBs) in the mutant spike:ACE2 complexes with respect to the native spike:ACE2 complex. Therefore, the findings of this study unravel plausible molecular mechanisms of increase in binding affinity of spike mutants (L452R, T478K and N501Y) to human ACE2 leading to higher virulence and infectivity of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The study will further aid in designing novel therapeutics targeting the interface residues between spike protein and ACE2 receptor.","output":"Structural and functional insights into the major mutations of SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD and its interaction with human ACE2 receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Most studies have shown that diabetic patients with COVID-19 have a higher proportion of mortality and poor prognosis.

The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and quickly spread to over 200 countries. COVID-19 can cause multiple organ injuries (e.g., kidney, heart, blood, and nervous system). Among them, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical complication due to its high incidence and mortality rate. So, it is essential to evaluate AKI in COVID-19 patients during this pandemic state. The aim of this work is to detect the occurrence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. So, a retrospective study was conducted on hospitalized adult patients > 18 years old with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the Abo Teeg Hospital at Assiut City, Egypt, from May 1, 2020, to July 1, 2020. All data were collected from medical records, patients follow-up, and charts. Data were verified, coded by the researcher, and analyzed using IBM-SPSS 21.0. RESULTS: Eighty-six COVID-19 patients were admitted to Abo Teeg Hospital in Assiut City, Egypt, between May and July 2020. Thirty-eight patients (33%) were of the male gender. Mean age was 58.07  17.9, and 61 patients developed AKI. 32.8% of the AKI group were a stage I severity (increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl within 48 h), 21.3% of them presented by stage II (2C2.9 times increase in serum creatinine), and 45.9% were in stage III (3 times or more increase in serum creatinine). The overall hospital mortality for the patients admitted to ICU with AKI was 6.7% (11/61), compared to 1% (4/25) in those without AKI.

For corrosion protection, hard chrome plating (HCP) is commercially used since the early 20th3. Yet the biggest drawback concerns environmental protection, since toxic and carcinogenic hexavalent chromium Cr6+ is used. As an alternative, thermal spray (TS) is increasingly used since the last 20 years. Nevertheless, the coatings are technologically constrained in regard to high porosity, low material efficiency and poor bonding to the base material. Therefore, the demand for an environmental friendly and economical process that produces high-quality coatings is increasingly coming into the research focus. With laser, dense, metallurgically bonded and therefore well-adhering coatings with high material efficiency of > 90% can be produced from a large number of metallic alloys without the need to use environmentally harmful chemicals or noise emissions. However, the typical area coating rate of < 0.4 m2/h is significantly lower than that of TS of about 10 m2/h4,5, and is too small for coating large-scale components. In this regard, a novel coating process with laser was developed in this work. By decoupling the melding of powder from the coating speed, the coating speed of < 2 m/min in conventional laser coating can be increased to > 500 m/min. Defect-free layers that metallurgically bond to the base material with a thickness of 50-250 m and a material efficiency of > 90% can be achieved. According to the results, an area coating rate up to 20 m2/h is achievable.

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Guilan Province, Iran. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on 1,000 patients with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to six hospitals in Guilan Province, Iran, from April 13 to June 14, 2020. This study evaluated the patients' clinical information, demographic characteristics, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans. Results: The mean age of the patients was obtained at 551.3 years, and the majority (n=800;80%) of the cases were male. Furthermore, most patients had underlying diseases, including respiratory system disease (n=173;17.3%), cardiovascular disease (n=711;71.1%), and malignancy (n=146;14.6%). Some of the most common causes of infection with coronavirus were being in crowded places (n=733;73.3%), close contact with an infected person (n=370;82.2%), possession of pets (n=107;23.2%), and family gatherings (n=822;82.2%). In addition, the most common clinical symptoms in patients included fever (n=911;91.1%), cough (n=900;90%), and dyspnea or shortness of breath (n=889;88.9%). Other less common symptoms were diarrhea (n=160;16%), vomiting (n=168;16.8%), and headache (n=217;21.7%). Dyspnea was developed in 889 patients (88.9%), and 660 (66%) cases had increased leucocytes. Conclusion: Coronavirus would cause mild to fatal pneumonia in patients. Therefore, early detection and treatment is of significant importance for these patients.

Timely prognosis and treatment are important to control the spread of this infection. Unreliable screening systems and limited number of clinical facilities are the major hurdles in controlling the spread of covid-19. Nowadays, many automated detection systems based on deep learning techniques using computed tomography (CT) images have been proposed to detect covid-19. However, these systems have the following drawbacks: (i) limited data problem poses a major hindrance to train the deep neural network model to provide accurate diagnosis, (ii) random choice of hyperparameters of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) significantly affects the classification performance, since the hyperparameters have to be application dependent and, (iii) the generalization ability using CNN classification is usually not validated. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose two models: (i) based on a transfer learning approach, and (ii) using novel strategy to optimize the CNN hyperparameters using Whale optimization-based BAT algorithm + AdaBoost classifier built using dynamic ensemble selection techniques. According to our second method depending on the characteristics of test sample, the classifier is chosen, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting and simultaneously produced promising results.

Less is known about why youth are engaging in social distancing and how these motivations are connected with their engagement, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Methods: Data were collected March 29th and 30th 2020, two-weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents motivations to engage in social distancing, social distancing behaviors, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Results: The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Engagement in social distancing was not significantly associated with adolescents mental or social health. However, specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Conclusions: Understanding adolescents motivations to engage in social distancing may help inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and improve mental and social health during pandemics.","output":"Adolescents Motivations to Engage in Social Distancing during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations with Mental and Social Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study investigated the impact of prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory failure on the patient outcome.

We used a multistate survival model to compare the outcomes of patients treated with or without prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which incorporates the dynamic nature of prone positioning and adjusts for potential confounders. SETTING: Seventy-two international institutions participating in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Critical Care Consortium international registry. PATIENTS: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients who were supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 232 coronavirus disease 2019 patients at 72 participating institutions who were supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period from February 16, 2020, to October 31, 2020. Proning was used in 176 patients (76%) before initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and in 67 patients (29%) during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Survival to hospital discharge was 33% in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation prone group versus 22% in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation supine group. Prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14C0.68).

To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, Iraq, like other countries, has imposed national lockdown measures, such as social distancing, restriction of automobile traffic, and industrial enterprises. This has led to reduced human activities and air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement in air quality. This study focused on the analysis of the impact of the six partial, total, and post-lockdown periods (1st partial lockdown from March 1 to16, 2020, 1st total lockdown from March 17 to April 21, 2nd partial lockdown from April 22 to May 23, 2nd total lockdown from May 24 to June 13, 3rd partial lockdown from June 14 to August 19, and end partial lockdown from August 20 to 31) on the average of daily NO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations, as well as air quality index (AQI) in 18 Iraqi provinces during these periods (from March 1st to August 31st, 2020). The analysis showed a decline in the average of daily PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations by 24%, 15%, and 8%, respectively from March 17 to April 21, 2020 (first phase of total lockdown) in comparison to the 1st phase of partial lockdown (March 1 to March 16, 2020).

This study has investigated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in outpatients of the Hospital das Clinicas, in Sao Paulo city (Brazil), which is a large university hospital belonging to the public health system that cares for patients with complex diseases who need tertiary or quaternary medical care. Our serological inquiry was carried out for 6 weeks, with once-a-week blood sampling and included 439 patients from several outpatient services. Overall, 61 patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (13.9%); 56.1 % of the patients live in Sao Paulo city, with the remaining living in other towns of the metropolitan area; 32.8% of the patients testing positive for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic, 55.7% developed mild or moderate disease and 11.5% had to be hospitalized. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive serology was lower among patients who had received the seasonal influenza vaccine compared to the ones who did not. These findings may indicate that those individuals care more about health issues, and/or that they have a better access to health care and/or a better quality of health care service.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 231 treatment naive patients with a single HCC  3 cm who had received either curative PRFA (162 patients) or curative SR (69 patients). All patients were regularly followed up after treatment at our department with blood and radiologic tests. RESULTS: The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates after PRFA and SR were 95.4%, 79.6% and 63.1%, respectively in the PRFA group and 100%, 81.4% and 74.6%, respectively in the SR group. The corresponding recurrence free survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years after PRFA and SR were 82.0%, 38.3% and 18.0%, respectively in the PRFA group and 86.0%, 47.2% and 26.0%, respectively in the SR group. In terms of overall survival and recurrence free survival, there were no significant differences between these two groups. In comparison of PRFA group patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) (n = 127) and SR group patients with LC (n = 50) and in comparison of PRFA group patients without LC (n = 35) and SR group patients without LC (n = 19), there were also no significant differences between two groups in terms of overall survival and recurrence free survival. In the multivariate analysis of the risk factors contributing to overall survival, serum albumin level was the sole significant factor. In the multivariate analysis of the risk factors contributing to recurrence free survival, presence of LC was the sole significant factor. The rate of serious adverse events in the SR group was significantly higher than that in the PRFA group (P = 0.023). Hospitalization length in the SR group was significantly longer than in the PRFA group (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: PRFA is as effective as SR in the treatment of single and small HCC, and is less invasive than SR.

METHOD A retrospective study of 11,848 THAs and 18,972 TKAs (2001-2002) was conducted. Death within 90 days and 1 year of the surgery were the main endpoints. Co-morbidity measures were calculated using either medication or hospitalisation history. Logistic regression models were employed and discrimination and calibration were assessed. Specifically, models with unweighted and weighted measure scores, models with the specific conditions, and a model combining conditions identified by all measures were assessed. RESULTS In THAs, the best performing prediction models included co-morbidities from all three measures (90 days: c = 0.84, P = 0.284, 1 year: c = 0.79, P = 0.158). Individually, the model with Charlson conditions performed best at 90 days mortality (c = 0.80, P = 0.777) and the Charlson and Elixhauser performed similarly at 1 year (both c = 0.77, P > 0.05). In TKAs, the best performing prediction model included co-morbidities from all measures (90 days: c = 0.82, P = 0.349, 1 year: c = 0.78, P = 0.873).

In the present study, 662 serum samples collected from February 2020 to January 2021 from acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients were tested to determine neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers using a microneutralization test (MNT) for live SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM directed against different viral antigens were measured by high-throughput automated platforms. We observed higher levels of NAbs in elderly (&gt;60 years old) individuals and in patients presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 NAbs develop as soon as five days from symptom onset and, despite a decline after the second month, persist for over 11 months, showing variable dynamics. Through correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we set up a testing algorithm, suitable for the laboratory workload, by establishing an optimal cutoff value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG for convalescent plasma donors to exclude from MNT samples foreseen to have low/negative NAb titers and ineligible for plasma donation. Overall, MNT, although cumbersome and not suitable for routine testing of large sample sizes, remains the reference tool for the assessment of antibody-mediated immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In particular, this study describes outputs from an idealised disease model that simulates the dynamics of a COVID-19 outbreak in a prison setting when varying levels of social interventions are in place, and a Monte Carlo-based model that assesses the reduction in risk of case importation, resulting from a process that requires incoming prisoners to undergo a period of self-isolation prior to admission into the general prison population. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Prisons, typically containing large populations confined in a small space with high degrees of mixing, have long been known to be especially susceptible to disease outbreaks. In an attempt to meet rising pressures from the emerging COVID-19 situation in early 2020, modellers for Public Health Englands Joint Modelling Cell were asked to produce some rapid response work that sought to inform the approaches that Her Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) might take to reduce the risk of case importation and sustained transmission in prison environments. FINDINGS: Key results show that deploying social interventions has the potential to considerably reduce the total number of infections, while such actions could also reduce the probability that an initial infection will propagate into a prison-wide outbreak. For example, modelling showed that a 50% reduction in the risk of transmission (compared to an unmitigated outbreak) could deliver a 98% decrease in total number of cases, while this reduction could also result in 86.8% of outbreaks subsiding before more than five persons have become infected. Furthermore, this study also found that requiring new arrivals to self-isolate for 10 and 14 days prior to admission could detect up to 98% and 99% of incoming infections, respectively. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: In this paper we have presented models which allow for the studying of COVID-19 in a prison scenario, while also allowing for the assessment of proposed social interventions. By publishing these works, the authors hope these methods might aid in the management of prisoners across additional scenarios and even during subsequent disease outbreaks. Such methods as described may also be readily applied use in other closed community settings. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: These works went towards informing HMPPS on the impacts that the described strategies might have during COVID-19 outbreaks inside UK prisons. The works described herein are readily amendable to the study of a range of addition outbreak scenarios. There is also room for these methods to be further developed and built upon which the timeliness of the original project did not permit.","output":"Insights gained from early modelling of COVID-19 to inform the management of outbreaks in UK prisons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019.

METHODS: Eight face\\\\to\\\\face reflective rounds took place in Southampton Children's Hospital, UK, from September 2017 to February 2020 with a further virtual round in July 2020 during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Each round was facilitated by a clinical psychologist and consultant. For each round, up to three volunteer panellists from different staff groups were invited to share their personal experiences on a pre\\\\selected subject to the large group. The group would then contribute to the discussion by offering their own reflections. Feedback forms were distributed to attendees and collated. RESULTS: Eight rounds were held with mean attendance of 32 (range 19C47). Across the eight rounds, the total attendance was 256 staff members. The virtual round had 20 participants. Feedback was received from 202 participants. The majority (98%) would recommend the rounds to colleagues with 64 participants (32%) rating the rounds as exceptional and 91 (45%) as excellent. The virtual round received similar positive feedback. CONCLUSION: Large group reflective practice can be implemented within an existing regular educational program.

Whether this is causative for the development of NAFLD is not yet clarified. Here we investigate the effect of hepatic DPP4 overexpression on the development of liver steatosis in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. METHODS: Plasma DPP4 activity of subjects with or without NAFLD was analyzed. Wild-type (WT) and liver-specific Dpp4 transgenic mice (Dpp4-Liv-Tg) were fed a high-fat diet and characterized for body weight, body composition, hepatic fat content and insulin sensitivity. In vitro experiments on HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were conducted to validate cell autonomous effects of DPP4 on lipid storage and insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Subjects suffering from insulin resistance and NAFLD show an increased plasma DPP4 activity when compared to healthy controls. Analysis of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice revealed elevated systemic DPP4 activity and diminished active GLP-1 levels. They furthermore show increased body weight, fat mass, adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic steatosis, liver damage and hypercholesterolemia. These effects were accompanied by increased expression of PPAR and CD36 as well as severe insulin resistance in the liver. In agreement, treatment of HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes with physiological concentrations of DPP4 resulted in impaired insulin sensitivity independent of lipid content. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give evidence that elevated expression of DPP4 in the liver promotes NAFLD and insulin resistance. This is linked to reduced levels of active GLP-1, but also to auto- and paracrine effects of DPP4 on hepatic insulin signaling.","output":"Elevated hepatic DPP4 activity promotes insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of physical activity (PA) as an intervention against anxiety disorders and depression is undeniable in clinical psychology. Therefore, the question arose whether these effects also occur when a fear stimulus, like the COVID-19 pandemic, affects otherwise healthy adolescents. Boredom is closely linked to symptoms of fear and anxiety, but the connection between PA, boredom and fear is partly unclear. METHODS: A cross-sectional online study was conducted that involved 122 students. Participants were 13C19 years old (M(age) = 15.83, SD = 1.73). The survey was available online from April 27th to May 3rd, 2020. At this time, schools in Germany had already been closed for 6 weeks. A self-report questionnaire was used to measure physical activity, boredom, and fear of COVID-19. A multiple linear regression model was conducted. RESULTS: The reported fear of COVID-19 significantly correlates with total PA, quantity of strenuous PA, and boredom. Furthermore, a significant regression equation was found. The variables boredom, PA, and age contribute significantly to predicting the fear of COVID-19 [R(2) = 0.127, F(3,118) = 6.876, p < 0.000], among adolescents. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that there is an association between PA, boredom and the quarantine experience of adolescents.

OBJECTIVES 1) To develop and provide evidence of validity for a comprehensive simulation-enhanced training (SET) curriculum for an advanced minimally invasive procedure; (2) to demonstrate transfer of acquired psychomotor skills from a simulation laboratory to live porcine model; and (3) to compare training outcomes of SET curriculum group and chief resident group. SETTING University. METHODS This prospective single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial allocated 20 intermediate-level surgery residents to receive either conventional training (control) or SET curriculum training (intervention). The SET curriculum consisted of cognitive, psychomotor, and nontechnical training modules. Psychomotor skills in a live anesthetized porcine model in the OR was the primary outcome. Knowledge of advanced minimally invasive and bariatric surgery and nontechnical skills in a simulated OR crisis scenario were the secondary outcomes. Residents in the SET curriculum group went on to perform a laparoscopic jejunojejunostomy in the OR. Cognitive, psychomotor, and nontechnical skills of SET curriculum group were also compared to a group of 12 chief surgery residents. RESULTS SET curriculum group demonstrated superior psychomotor skills in a live porcine model (56 [47-62] versus 44 [38-53], P<.05) and superior nontechnical skills (41 [38-45] versus 31 [24-40], P<.01) compared with conventional training group. SET curriculum group and conventional training group demonstrated equivalent knowledge (14 [12-15] versus 13 [11-15], P = 0.47). SET curriculum group demonstrated equivalent psychomotor skills in the live porcine model and in the OR in a human patient (56 [47-62] versus 63 [61-68]; P = .21). SET curriculum group demonstrated inferior knowledge (13 [11-15] versus 16 [14-16]; P<.05), equivalent psychomotor skill (63 [61-68] versus 68 [62-74]; P = .50), and superior nontechnical skills (41 [38-45] versus 34 [27-35], P<.01) compared with chief resident group. CONCLUSION Completion of the SET curriculum resulted in superior training outcomes, compared with conventional surgery training.

Specifically, this project aims to use deep learning to (1) predict an individual's risk of suicide or self-harm, (2) assess conversation success and CV skill using robust metrics, and (3) extrapolate demographic information from a texter survey to conversations where the texter did not complete the survey. To these ends, contributions to deep learning include a modified Transformer-over-BERT model; a framework for multitask learning to improve generalisation in the presence of sparse labels; and a mathematical model for using imperfect machine learning models to estimate population parameters from a biased training set. Key results include a deep learning model with likely better performance at predicting suicide risk than trained CVs and the ability to predict whether a texter is 21 or under with 88.4% accuracy. We produce three metrics for conversation success and evaluate the validity and usefulness for each. Finally, reversal of participation bias provides evidence that women, who make up 80.3% of conversations with an associated texter survey, make up closer to 73.5%- 74.8% of all conversations; and that if, after every conversation, the texter had shared whether they found their conversation helpful, affirmative answers would fall from 85.1% to 45.45% - 46.51%.","output":"DeepHelp: Deep Learning for Shout Crisis Text Conversations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online social work services (e.g., telemental health; telebehavioral health; virtual care; telehealth) present significant opportunities for clinical social workers to provide effective care to marginalized populations, such as LGBTQ+ youth.

Here, we tracked the effects of early life Ivermectin treatment in Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis) on growth rates, mortality, metabolically expensive organ size, and susceptibility to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infection. One year after exposure, there was no effect of Ivermectin exposure on frog mass (X(2)(1) = 0.904, p = 0.34), but when tracked through the exponential growth phase (~2.5 years) the Ivermectin exposed individuals had lower growth rates and were ultimately smaller (X(2)(1) = 7.78, p = 0.005; X(2)(1) = 5.36, p = 0.02, respectively).

However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct values obtained from SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity. Methods: We performed amplification of a human gene target (beta-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1282 NP specimens collected from patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP specimen quality, characterized by late Ct values for the human gene target beta-actin Ct, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-actin Ct. Results: Low-quality NP swabs are less likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio, 0.607 [95% credible interval {CrI}, .487-.753]). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-actin Ct values (slope, 0.181 [95% CrI, .097-.264]), consistent with a reduction in detection of 0.181 cycles for each additional cycle of the beta-actin target. COVID-19 disease severity was not associated with beta-actin Ct values. Conclusions: Variability in NP specimen quality significantly impacts the performance of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays, and caution should be taken when interpreting quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Ct results. If unrecognized, low-quality NP specimens, which are characterized by a low level of amplifiable human DNA target, may limit the successful application of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to direct infection control and public health interventions.","output":"Quantifying the Impact of Nasopharyngeal Specimen Quality on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Test Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 originated in Wuhan and rippled across China.

Noninvasive prenatal diagnostics (NIPT) predicts fetal genotype, identifying pregnancies with no risk. All current techniques detect fetal antigen alleles with unspecific background and without estimation of fetal fraction, thus new protocols for detection of fetal BG/HPA alleles with ultrahigh sensitivity still need to be tested to improve NIPT. AIM To design NIPT of clinically important antigens using Ion AmpliSeq HD technology. METHODS Plasma DNA from 36 pregnant women (9-33 week of gestation, 24 immunized with anti-HPA-1a,-3b,-15a, -K, or -D+C+S), with known BG/HPA genotypes of their neonates/partners, was tested on Ion S5 System using the Ion AmpliSeq HD designer custom gene panel. NGS contained 25 rs-targets encoding relevant BG/HPA antigens and 10 markers. RESULTS Using the NGS protocol, 76 out of 85 differences in fetal/maternal BG/HPA genotypes were determined in concentration above 2% fetal paternally inherited allele chimerism. The level of unspecific reads for BG/HPA alleles was below 0.87%. In 24 immunized women NGS revealed feto-maternal incompatibility in 11 cases (from 2.44% to 7.41%) and excluded in 10 (<0.05%), three cases had inconclusive results (1.79%, 0.19%, 0.11%). The presence of fetal DNA was confirmed in each case by detecting markers with at least 2% chimerism. CONCLUSION The use of Ion AmpliSeq HD technology improves the prediction of feto-maternal incompatibility, increasing the sensitivity of BG/HPA NIPT and serving confirmation of the fetal DNA at the same workflow.","output":"Prediction of fetal blood group antigens from maternal plasma using Ion AmpliSeq HD technology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the long-term health consequences of COVID-19 are not fully understood. We aimed to determine the long-term lung pathology and blood chemistry changes in Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2. Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were inoculated with 10(5) PFU of SARS-CoV-2, and changes post-infection (pi) were observed for 20 days. On days 5 and 20 pi, the lungs were harvested and processed for pathology and viral load count. Multiple blood samples were collected every 3 to 5 days to observe dynamic changes in blood chemistry. Infected hamsters showed consistent weight loss until day 7 pi At day 5 pi, histopathology of the lungs showed moderate to severe inflammation and the virus could be detected. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has an acute onset and recovery course in the hamster infection model. During the acute onset, blood triglyceride levels increased significantly at day 3 pi During the recovery course, uric acid and low-density lipoprotein levels increased significantly, but the total protein and albumin levels decreased. Together, our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters not only causes lung damage but also causes long-term changes in blood biochemistry during the recovery process. IMPORTANCE COVID-19 is now considered a multiorgan disease with a wide range of manifestations. There are increasing reports of persistent and long-term effects after acute COVID-19, but the long-term health consequences of COVID-19 are not fully understood.

These effects are challenging to study, especially for elusive species with large spatial requirements, as it is hard to obtain reliable proxies of recreational intensity over extensive areas. Commonly used proxies, such as the density of, or distance to, hiking paths, ignore outdoor recreation occurring on other linear feature types. Here we utilized crowdsourced data from the Strava training app to obtain a large-scale proxy for pedestrian outdoor recreation intensity in southeast Norway. We used the proxy and GPS-tracking data from collared Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) to investigate how recreation affects habitat selection at the home range scale and local scale by lynx during summer. We fitted resource selection functions at the two scales using conditional logistic regression. Our analysis revealed that lynx avoided areas of recreational activity at the local scale, but not at home range scale. Nonetheless, lynx frequently used areas associated with recreation, and to a greater degree at night than during the day. Our results suggest that local-scale avoidance of recreation and temporal adjustments of habitat use by lynx mitigate the need for a home range-scale response towards recreation.

From July 2008 to October 2015, 39 consecutive patients with SHHCC were screened. Of these, 12 were treated with TACE/TAE and repeated RF ablation (TACE/TAE + RF ablation group) and the remaining 27 patients were treated with the aforementioned new strategy (new strategy group). Local tumor progression (LTP)-free survival, intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on several clinicopathological variables to identify factors affecting long-term outcome and intrahepatic recurrence. Correlation analysis was also performed. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year LTP-free survival rates and OS rates were significantly higher in the new strategy group than in the TACE/TAE + RF ablation group (82.9% vs 58.3%, 73.9% vs 29.2%, 18.5% vs 9.7%, P = 0.002; 92.0% vs 75.0%, 84.0% vs 33.3%, 32.7% vs 16.7%, P = 0.025). However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the 1-, 2-, and 3-year IDR-free survival rates (P = 0.108).

Many discourses and practices surrounding hospitals new investments in information and communication technologies tend to revolve around security provision. Oftentimes, however, scenarios of extreme and exceptional circumstances are used to justify the implementation of identification and tracking technologies that may be more about managerial control than patient care. Drawing upon qualitative research in 23 U.S. hospitals from 2007 to 2009, our analysis focuses on hospitals deployment of identification and location technologies that manage patients, track personnel, and generate data in real-time. These systems are framed as aiding in the process of managing supplies and medications for pandemic flu outbreaks, monitoring exposure patterns for infectious diseases, and helping triage or manage the location and condition of patients during mass casualty disasters. We show that in spite of the framing of security and emergency preparedness, these technologies are primarily managerial tools for hospital administrators. Just as systems can be used to track infection vectors, those same systems can be used on a daily basis to monitor the workflow of hospital personnel, including nurses, physicians, and custodial staff, and to discipline or reward according to performance. In other words, the biosecuritization modality of the technological imperative leads to the framing of medical progress as the rationalization of organizations through technological monitoring, which is intended to promote accountability and new forms of responsibilization of healthcare workers.","output":"The biosecuritization of healthcare delivery: Examples of post-9/11 technological imperatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dendritic-cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; CD209) has an important role in mediating adherence of Mycobacteria species, including M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG to human dendritic cells and macrophages, in which these bacteria can survive intracellularly. DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin, and interactions with mycobacterial cells are believed to occur via mannosylated structures on the mycobacterial surface. Recent studies suggest more varied modes of binding to multiple mycobacterial ligands. Here we identify, by affinity chromatography and mass-spectrometry, four novel ligands of M. bovis BCG that bind to DC-SIGN. The novel ligands are chaperone protein DnaK, 60 kDa chaperonin-1 (Cpn60.1), glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and lipoprotein lprG. Other published work strongly suggests that these are on the cell surface. Of these ligands, lprG appears to bind DC-SIGN via typical proteinglycan interactions, but DnaK and Cpn60.1 binding do not show evidence of carbohydrate-dependent interactions.

Herein, focused 1,2,4-triazole-1,2,3-triazole molecular hybrids with varying lengths and decorations, mimicking the thematic features of non-hydroxamate inhibitors, were designed and synthesized using efficient protocols and were alkylated with pharmacophoric amines to develop new Mannich bases. After full spectroscopic characterization the newly synthesized triazoles tethering Mannich bases were subjected to safety assessment via MTT assay against normal human fibroblasts, then evaluated for their potential anticancer activities against colon (Caco-2) and breast (MDA-MB 231) cancers. The relatively lengthy bis-Mannich bases 15 and 16 were safer and more potent than 5-fluorouracil with sub-micromolar IC(50) and promising selectivity to the screened cancer cell lines rather than normal cells. Both compounds upregulated p53 (2C5.6-fold) and suppressed cyclin D expression (0.8C0.2-fold) in the studied cancers, and thus, induced apoptosis. 15 was superior to 16 in terms of cytotoxic activities, p53 induction, and cyclin D suppression. Mechanistically, both were efficient MMP-2/9 inhibitors with comparable potencies to the reference prototype hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitor NNGH at their anticancer IC(50) concentrations. 15 (IC(50) = 0.143 M) was 4-fold more potent than NNGH against MMP-9 with promising selectivity (3.27-fold) over MMP-2, whereas 16 was comparable to NNGH.

Subjects performed intermittent contractions (1 s) of the calf muscle at 20% maximal voluntary contraction, and the leg blood flow (LBF), leg vascular conductance (LVC) and EMG activities of the triceps surae muscles were measured during each contraction-relaxation period (3 s). The LBF and LVC responses were averaged for each subject and fitted using a four-phase, exponential growth and decay function. Hypoxia evoked significant increases in the change in LBF (15%) and LVC (23%) from the start to the end of exercise, as well as the amplitude of the rapid growth phase of LBF and LVC (21%). Similar, but non-significant, effects on the amplitude of the slow growth phase of LBF (P = 0.08) and LVC (P = 0.10) were observed. By contrast, hypoxia had no effect on temporal parameters of these growth phases, parameters defining the decay phases or EMG activities.

To better treat this condition, we need greater understanding of the pathogenesis, as well as objective biomarkers to predict treatment response. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a firm place as a biomarker for diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), but until recently has had little role for disease of the peripheral nervous system. Objectives: To review the current state-of-the-art of peripheral nerve MRI in diabetic and HIV symmetrical polyneuropathy. We used systematic literature search methods to identify all studies currently published, using this as a basis for a narrative review to discuss major findings in the literature. We also assessed risk of bias, as well as technical aspects of MRI and statistical analysis. Methods: Protocol was pre-registered on NIHR PROSPERO database. MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE databases were searched from 1946 to 15th August 2020 for all studies investigating either diabetic or HIV neuropathy and MRI, focusing exclusively on studies investigating symmetrical polyneuropathy. The NIH quality assessment tool for observational and cross-sectional cohort studies was used for risk of bias assessment. Results: The search resulted in 18 papers eligible for review, 18 for diabetic neuropathy and 0 for HIV neuropathy. Risk of bias assessment demonstrated that studies generally lacked explicit sample size justifications, and some may be underpowered. Whilst most studies made efforts to balance groups for confounding variables (age, gender, BMI, disease duration), there was lack of consistency between studies. Overall, the literature provides convincing evidence that DPN is associated with larger nerve cross sectional area, T2-weighted hyperintense and hypointense lesions, evidence of nerve oedema on Dixon imaging, decreased fractional anisotropy and increased apparent diffusion coefficient compared with controls. Analysis to date is largely restricted to the sciatic nerve or its branches. Conclusions: There is emerging evidence that various structural MR metrics may be useful as biomarkers in diabetic polyneuropathy, and areas for future direction are discussed. Expanding this technique to other forms of peripheral neuropathy, including HIV neuropathy, would be of value.

METHODS: In Phase I of the study, a cross-sectional study, 3712 students living in 1569 dorm rooms in 13 buildings responded to a questionnaire about incidence and duration of common colds in the previous 12 months. In Phase II, air temperature, relative humidity and CO(2) concentration were measured for 24 hours in 238 dorm rooms in 13 buildings, during both summer and winter. Out-to indoor air flow rates at night were calculated based on measured CO(2) concentrations. RESULTS: In Phase I, 10% of college students reported an incidence of more than 6 common colds in the previous 12 months, and 15% reported that each infection usually lasted for more than 2 weeks. Students in 6-person dorm rooms were about 2 times as likely to have an incidence of common colds 6 times per year and a duration 2 weeks, compared to students in 3-person rooms. In Phase II, 90% of the measured dorm rooms had an out-to indoor air flow rate less than the Chinese standard of 8.3 L/s per person during the heating season. There was a dose-response relationship between out-to indoor air flow rate per person in dorm rooms and the proportion of occupants with annual common cold infections 6 times.

Notwithstanding, the intensive research work done in different pharmaceutical research fronts such as disposal and fate, environmental impacts and concerns, human health risks, removal, degradation and development of treatment technologies, found that such research is not totally aligned with the market trends and consumption patterns. There are other drivers and interests that promote the pharmaceutical research. Thus, this review is an important contribution to those that are interested not only on the pharmaceutical market and drugs consumption, but also on the links, the drivers and interests that motivate and determine the research work on certain groups of pharmaceuticals on water and wastewater.","output":"Pharmaceuticals Market, Consumption Trends and Disease Incidence Are Not Driving the Pharmaceutical Research on Water and Wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Emergency Management and Response Information Sharing and Analysis Center's (EMR-ISAC) InfoGram is a weekly publication of information concerning the protection of critical infrastructures relevant to members of the Emergency Services Sector This issue includes the following articles: DHS extends SAFER [Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response] grant deadline, waives some requirements;FEMA creates exercise documents for COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] reopening planning;Communication cards break barriers for those with hearing disabilities;Technology Clearinghouse: Promoting Innovative Solutions;Cyber Diligence and Health Crises;Phishing attacks lure through threat of termination, stimulus money;CISA [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency] releases Cybersecurity Framework for Emergency Service Sector;and 6 Steps to Securing IoT [Internet of Things] Devices and Taking Back Your Privacy COVID-19 (Disease);Grants-in-aid;People with disabilities--Services for;Technology;Cybersecurity;Infrastructure (Economics)","output":"FEMA creates exercise documents for COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] reopening planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a patient with COVID-19 who developed simultaneous pulmonary, intracardiac and peripheral arterial thrombosis.

Thrombosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the third most common cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke. DVT is associated with the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein in the body. Thrombosis promotes slowed blood flow, hypoxia, cell activation, and the associated release of many active substances involved in blood clot formation. All thrombi which adhere to endothelium consist of fibrin, platelets, and trapped red and white blood cells. In this review, we summarise the impact of various factors affecting haemostatic disorders leading to blood clot formation. The paper discusses the causes of thrombosis, the mechanism of blood clot formation, and factors such as hypoxia, the involvement of endothelial cells (ECs), and the activation of platelets and neutrophils along with the effects of bacteria and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanisms related to the action of anticoagulants affecting coagulation factors including antiplatelet drugs have also been discussed.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review at a tertiary referral center. METHODS Patients who underwent surgery via EETA from January 2009 to May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Intraoperative CSF leakage was graded 0-3 in terms of the dural defect size; various repairs were used depending on the grade. RESULTS A total of 777 patients underwent 869 operations via EETA; 609 (70.1%) experienced no intraoperative CSF leakage (grade 0) but 260 (29.9%) did. Leakage was of grade 1 in 135 cases (15.5%), grade 2 in 83 (9.6%), and grade 3 in 42 (4.8%). In 260 patients with intraoperative CSF leakage, a buttress was wedged into the sellar defect site in 178 cases (68.5%) and a pedicled flap was placed in 105 cases (40.4%). Autologous fat (108 cases, 41.5%) and a synthetic dural substitute (91 cases, 35%) were used to fill the dead space of the sellar resection cavity. Postoperative CSF leakage developed in 21 patients: 6 of grade 1, 7 of grade 2, and 8 of grade 3. Buttress placement significantly decreased postoperative leakage in grade 1 patients (p = 0.041). In patients of perioperative leakage grades 2 and 3, postoperative CSF leakage was significantly reduced only when both fat and a buttress were applied (p = 0.042 and p = 0.043, respectively).

Loss of protein structure is described by two reaction coordinates: conformational disorder of the polymer and wetting by the solvent. These establish a competition between conformational entropy and hydrophobic interaction favoring random coil or globular states, respectively. Based on the Landau theory of phase transition, the resulting free energy barrier is found to decrease linearly with the temperature difference T-Tm, and the inactivation rate should scale as U to the power of T-Tm. This form recalls an accepted model of thermal damage to cells in hyperthermia. For SARS-CoV-2 the value of U in Celsius units is found to be 1.32. Although the fitting of the model to measured data is practically indistinguishable from Arrhenius law with an activation energy, the entropy barrier mechanism is more suitable and could explain the pronounced sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to thermal damage. Accordingly, we predict the efficacy of mild fever over a period of about 24 hours in inactivating the virus.","output":"Thermal Inactivation Scaling Applied for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Horizon scanning aims to systematically identify upcoming health technologies and thus allows policy-makers to be better prepared for the entry of new medicines with possibly high price tags into the national health system. The aim of this study is to survey the existence of national and cross-national horizon scanning systems for medicines in European countries. Methods: Experts working in public authorities (members of the Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Information/PPRI network) in the WHO European region participated in surveys in 2014 and 2019 and informed about the status of horizon scanning in their country (response rate: 14 and 44 countries, respectively). Identified advanced horizon scanning systems as of 2019 were further investigated based on a literature review. Results: In 2019, six countries (Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom) reported systematic use of horizon scanning for some new medicines, and four countries (Austria, Denmark, France, Ireland) had some horizon scanning activities ongoing. No systematic use of horizon scanning was reported from the remaining 34 countries. The findings of the survey undertaken five years earlier were similar, with even fewer systems in place. A recent development is the establishment of cross-country initiatives of governments that aim, among others, to jointly perform horizon scanning; the International Horizon Scanning Initiative (IHSI) initiated by the Beneluxa collaboration is the most advanced undertaking in this respect. Countries with systematic use tend to have horizon scanning fully integrated in a system for the management of new medicines, and they use horizon scanning outcomes to inform decisions as to whether or not a Health Technology Assessment will be conducted and price negotiations be started. Differences between existing horizon scanning systems mainly concern the timings of scanning and reporting, the sources for the inputs and the accessibility of the findings. Conclusion: There appears to be a discrepancy between the perceived importance of horizon scanning based on some eye-opening examples in the past and its actual implementation in European health systems. The latter is likely attributable to horizon scanning being resource-intensive. The establishment of new national and international horizon scanning systems offers the opportunity to investigate their impact on sustainable access to affordable medicines from the start.","output":"Ready for the future?

In this retrospective single center study, we reviewed 252 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients treated at one temporary cabin hospital in Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, serial chest computed tomography (CT), and serial viral test data were compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The association between clinical features and symptomatic status or patient referral status was analyzed. Among all 252 patients, 74 (29.4%) were asymptomatic and 138 (54.76%) had more than two family members who developed COVID-19. The probability for family clustering was similar between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (59.70 vs. 61.64%, P = 0.79). Asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients were equally likely to reach a virus-free state during their stay at the cabin hospital (93.15 vs. 86.44%, P = 0.13). The initial chest CT screening showed that 81 (32.1%) patients had no visible pneumonia, 52 (20.6%) had unilateral pneumonia, and 119 (47.2%) had bilateral pneumonia. Symptomatic patients had a higher chance to have bilateral pneumonia (P < 0.0001) and were less likely to show improvement on the follow-up CT scan (P = 0.0002).

MethodsWe simulated study populations under varying vaccination probabilities, COVID-19 VE, influenza VE, and proportions of controls included with the other vaccine-preventable ARI. Mean bias was calculated as the difference between true and estimated VE. Absolute mean bias in VE estimates was classified as low (<10%), moderate (10% to <20%), and high ([]20%). ResultsWhere vaccination probabilities are positively correlated, COVID-19 and influenza VE test-negative studies with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 ARI controls, respectively, underestimate VE.

For influenza VE studies, mean bias was low for all scenarios where SARS-CoV-2 represented []10% of controls. Although bias was driven by the conditional probability of vaccination, low VE of the vaccine of interest and high VE of the confounding vaccine increase its magnitude. ConclusionsWhere a low percentage of controls are included with the other vaccine-preventable ARI, bias in COVID-19 and influenza VE estimates is low.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a matched case-control study among adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who had results from a SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Immunization histories, relevant clinical data, and RT-PCR test results were obtained from the Yale New Haven Health Systems medical records between June 1, 2021, and August 15, 2021, when the Delta variant caused 92% of infections in Connecticut. Case participants were defined as adolescents who had a positive test result and an associated medical encounter. Control participants were defined as those who had a negative test result and were matched to a case participant by age, county of residence, and date of testing. EXPOSURES: Adolescents were defined as fully immunized if they had received 2 doses of vaccine at least 14 days before focal time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. The vaccines effectiveness (VE) was estimated using matched odds ratios from conditional logistic regression models. Secondary measures included estimated VE by clinical symptoms, number of vaccine doses received, and elapsed time from immunization. RESULTS: A total of 6901 adolescents were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample comprised 186 case participants and 356 matched control participants. The median age was 14 (IQR, 13-16) years, 262 (48%) identified as female, 81 (15%) as Black, 82 (15%) as Hispanic, and 297 (55%) as White. Overall, 134 (25%) were fully immunized (case participants, 10 [5%]; control participants, 124 [35%]). The median time between immunization and the SARS-CoV-2 test was 62 days (range, 17-129 days). Within 4 months of receiving 2 doses, VE against any infection was estimated to be 91% (95% CI, 80%-96%); against asymptomatic infection, 85% (95% CI, 57%-95%). Effectiveness after a single dose was estimated to be 74% (95% CI, 18%-92%).

METHODS: Using longitudinal data from a national dialysis provider, we constructed hierarchical, linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the relationships between neighborhood food environment or socioeconomic status and serum phosphorus level among patients receiving incident dialysis. RESULTS: Our cohort included 258,510 patients receiving chronic hemodialysis in 2005-2013. Median age at dialysis initiation was 64 years, 45% were female, 32% were Black, and 15% were Hispanic.

Living in a neighborhood with better availability of healthy food was not associated with a lower phosphorus level. Neighborhood income also was not associated with differences in phosphorus. Patient age, race, cause of ESKD, and mean monthly dialysis duration were most closely associated with phosphorus level. CONCLUSIONS: Neither neighborhood availability of healthy food options nor neighborhood income was associated with phosphorus levels in patients receiving chronic dialysis.

In mammalian species oligomannose N-glycans can have up to 9 Man, meanwhile structures can grow to over 200 units in yeast mannan. The highly dynamic nature, branching complexity and 3D structure of oligomannoses have been recently highlighted for their roles in immune escape and infectivity of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV2. The architectural features that allow these N-glycans to perform their functions is yet unclear, due to their intrinsically disordered nature that hinders their structural characterization. In this work we will discuss the results of over 54 s of cumulative sampling by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of differently processed, free (not protein-linked) oligomannose N-glycans common in vertebrates. We then discuss the effects of a protein surface on their structural equilibria based on over 4 s cumulative MD sampling of the fully glycosylated CD16a Fc gamma receptor (FcRIIIa), where the type of glycosylation is known to modulate its binding affinity for IgG1s, regulating the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our results show that the proteins structural constraints shift the oligomannoses conformational ensemble to promote conformers that satisfy the steric requirements and hydrogen bonding networks demanded by the proteins surface landscape. More importantly, we find that the protein does not actively distort the N-glycans into structures not populated in the unlinked forms in solution. Ultimately, the highly populated conformations of the Man5 linked glycans support experimental evidence of high levels of hybrid complex forms at N45 and show a specific presentation of the arms at N162, which may be involved in mediating binding affinity to the IgG1 Fc.","output":"The oligomannose N-glycans 3D architecture and its response to the FcRIIIa structural landscape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of acetaminophen (APAP) is increasing recently, especially with COVID-19 outbreaks.

METHODS: Adult male albino rats were divided into groups: Control group, APAP-induced hepatotoxicity group, Vitamin E-treated group, H2S-treated group and NEC-1-treated group. Serum levels for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), interleukin-33 (IL-33), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid profile were measured. Histopathological examinations of liver tissue with H(et)E stain and immunohistochemistry for activated caspase-3 were also done.

RECENT FINDINGS: Typical symptom for SB infections is diarrhea, mostly self-limiting. Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoan parasites, and helminths. Host-pathogen interaction is of special interest in infections with potentially severe or prolonged course. Research uses increasingly enterocyte cell culture systems. SARS-CoV2 can also infect enterocytes via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and causes gastrointestinal complaints in some patients. Chronic SB infections as tuberculosis, Cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus have to be differentiated from Crohn's and other diseases. Severe rare fungal and protozoan parasitic infections can cause relevant morbidity in immunocompromised patients. Soil-transmitted helminthic infections are a special issue in endemic areas. SUMMARY: Many infections involve the SB, typically causing mild and self-limiting diarrhea. Symptomatic therapy, hygiene, and isolation are the mainstay of management.

As an emerging virus, CHIKV imposes a threat to public health. Currently, there are no vaccines or antivirals available for the prevention of CHIKV infection. Lycorine, an alkaloid from Amaryllidaceae plants, has antiviral activity against a number of viruses such as coronavirus, flavivirus and enterovirus. In this study, we found that lycorine could inhibit CHIKV in cell culture at a concentration of 10 mol/L without apparent cytotoxicity. In addition, it exhibited broad-spectrum anti-alphavirus activity, including Sindbis virus (SINV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV), and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEEV).

The measures used in this study included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Short Grit Scale, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS). The results of mediation analyses revealed significant indirect effects of consistency of interest, a major component of grit, on psychological distress;we also found non-significant indirect effects of perseverance of effort, another major component of grit, on psychological distress. These results suggest that consistency of interest buffers the psychological distress induced by fear of COVID-19. Based on these results, it can be concluded that individuals with higher consistency of interest are less likely to experience worsening of their mental health, even if they experience fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","output":"Interest consistency can buffer the effect of COVID-19 fear on psychological distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We aimed to demonstrate the computed tomography (CT) findings observed at the initial presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and reveal the most frequent infiltration and distribution patterns of the disease.

We comprehensively analyzed the most common and relatively rare CT imaging features (e.g., distribution pattern, density of the lesions, additional CT signs) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (20.6%) had no evidence of pneumonia on their initial high-resolution CT images. Among 147 patients (79.4%) who had parenchymal infiltration consistent with pneumonia, 10 (6.8%) had a negative baseline RT-PCR test, and positivity was detected as a result of repeated tests. Most of the patients had multifocal (89.1%) and bilateral (86.4%) lesions. The most common location, right lower lobe, was affected in 87.8% of the patients. Lesions were distributed predominantly at peripheral (87.1%) and posterior (46.3%) areas of lung parenchyma. Most of the patients had pure ground glass opacity (GGO) (82.3%) followed by GGO with consolidation (32.7%) and crazy paving pattern (21.8%). Pure consolidation, solid nodules, halo sign, reverse halo sign, vascular enlargement, subpleural line, air-bronchogram, and bronchiectasis were the other findings observed in at least 15% of the cases. Halo sign, acinar nodules, air-bubble sign, pleural thickening and effusion, mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy were seen rarely (2%-12.9%). Pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, cavitation, and tree-in-bud pattern were not detected in our study group.

We identified 12 studies for inclusion after searching four databases: Web of Science, PubMed, AJOL, and EBSCOhost for articles written in English from January 2020 to April 2021. Anxiety disorder with rates from 9.5% to 73.3% and depression, 12.5% to 71.9%, were the most reported PDs. Availability of protective gear and information regarding preventive measures reduced the risk of developing any PDs, while psychoactive substance use, history of chronic medical illness, low level of resilience, and low social support increased these risks. A considerable proportion of HCWs manifest various psychological problems such as their counterparts in other parts of the world. Multiple factors were also implicated as risk, albeit associations were not consistently established across the studies.

Individuals display a wide range of responses to stress, which can manifest in a variety of outcomes for the brain as well as subsequent behavior. Chronic Social Defeat Stress (CSDS) in mice has been widely used to model individual variation following a social stressor. Following a course of repeated intermittent psychological and physical stress, mice diverge into separate populations of social reactivity: resilient (socially interactive) and susceptible (socially avoidant) animals. A rich body of work reveals distinct neurobiological and behavioral consequences of this experience that map onto the resilient and susceptible groups. However, the range of factors that emerge over the course of defeat have not been fully described. Therefore, in the current study, we focused on characterizing behavioral, physiological, and neuroendocrine profiles of mice in three separate phases: before, during, and following CSDS. We found that following CSDS, traditional read-outs of anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors do not map on to the resilient and susceptible groups. By contrast, behavioral coping strategies used during the initial social stress encounter better predict which mice will eventually become resilient or susceptible. In particular, mice that will emerge as susceptible display greater escape behavior on Day 1 of social defeat than those that will emerge as resilient, indicating early differences in coping mechanisms used between the two groups. We further show that the social avoidance phenotype in susceptible mice is specific to the aggressor strain and does not generalize to conspecifics or other strains, indicating that there may be features of threat discrimination that are specific to the susceptible mice. Our findings suggest that there are costs and benefits to both the resilient and susceptible outcomes, reflected in their ability to cope and adapt to the social stressor.","output":"Characterizing the behavioral and neuroendocrine features of susceptibility and resilience to social stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes in healthcare and surgical training, with elective operating reduced or stopped, conferences rearranged and examinations cancelled.

It is crucial to identify patients who are suspected of having COVID-19 early, because the vaccine is not readily available in certain parts of the world. Methodology: Lung computed tomography (CT) imaging can be used to diagnose COVID-19 as an alternative to the RT-PCR test in some cases. The occurrence of ground-glass opacities in the lung region is a characteristic of COVID-19 in chest CT scans, and these are daunting to locate and segment manually. The proposed study consists of a combination of solo deep learning (DL) and hybrid DL (HDL) models to tackle the lesion location and segmentation more quickly. One DL and four HDL modelsnamely, PSPNet, VGG-SegNet, ResNet-SegNet, VGG-UNet, and ResNet-UNetwere trained by an expert radiologist. The training scheme adopted a fivefold cross-validation strategy on a cohort of 3000 images selected from a set of 40 COVID-19-positive individuals. Results: The proposed variability study uses tracings from two trained radiologists as part of the validation. Five artificial intelligence (AI) models were benchmarked against MedSeg.

Here, we investigated the mechanism by which astrocytes regulate IL-8 expression. We demonstrate that while ?-catenin negatively regulated IL-8 transcription, its canonical transcriptional partners, members of the TCF/LEF transcription factors (TCF1, TCF3, TCF4 and LEF1) and Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) positively regulated IL-8 transcription. We further identified a putative TCF/LEF binding site at -175nt close to the minimal transcription region on the IL-8 promoter, mutation of which caused a significant reduction in IL-8 promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated binding of TCF1, TCF4, LEF1 and ATF2 on the IL-8 promoter suggesting that TCFs/LEF partner with ATF2 to induce IL-8 transcription.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a digital therapeutic care app compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in Germany. We further aimed to explore under which circumstances the reimbursement rate could be modified to consider value-based pricing. METHODS: We developed a state-transition Markov model based on a best-practice analysis of prior LBP-related decision-analytic models, and evaluated the cost utility of a digital therapeutic care app compared to TAU in Germany. Based on a 3-year time horizon, we simulated the incremental cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for people with nonacute LBP from the societal perspective. In the deterministic sensitivity and scenario analyses, we focused on diverging attrition rates and app cost to assess our models robustness and conditions for changing the reimbursement rate. All costs are reported in Euro (1=US $1.12). RESULTS: Our base case results indicated that the digital therapeutic care strategy led to an incremental cost of 121.59, but also generated 0.0221 additional QALYs compared to the TAU strategy, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5486 per QALY. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the reimbursement rate and the capability of digital therapeutic care to prevent reoccurring LBP episodes have a significant impact on the ICER. At the same time, the other parameters remained unaffected and thus supported the robustness of our model. In the scenario analysis, the different model time horizons and attrition rates strongly influenced the economic outcome. Reducing the cost of the app to 99 per 3 months or decreasing the apps attrition rate resulted in digital therapeutic care being significantly less costly with more generated QALYs, and is thus considered to be the dominant strategy over TAU. CONCLUSIONS: The current reimbursement rate for a digital therapeutic care app in the statutory health insurance can be considered a cost-effective measure compared to TAU. The apps attrition rate and effect on the patients prolonged behavior change essentially influence the settlement of an appropriate reimbursement rate. Future value-based pricing targets should focus on additional outcome parameters besides pain intensity and functional disability by including attrition rates and the apps long-term effect on quality of life.","output":"Digital Therapeutic Care Apps With Decision-Support Interventions for People With Low Back Pain in Germany: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonthermal, biocompatible plasma (NBP) is a promising unique state of matter that is effective against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The Health in Prisons Programme (HIPP) of the WHO Regional Office for Europe worked with partner organizations to review regularly the evidence on best practices in prison health and use it to inform policy recommendations at the global level. HIPP issued overarching guidance and specific tools to support implementation of measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 in prisons and other custodial settings. Moreover, to monitor the emergence of outbreaks, the HIPP developed a minimum data set for countries voluntarily to report COVID-19 cases and identify situations in need of direct support. FINDINGS: Since May 2020, the WHO has periodically received data from Member States, leading to the development of country-specific bulletins to support countries and, whenever appropriate, to organize virtual missions to further support ministries and public health bodies responsible for managing COVID-19 in prisons.

In this study, we considered a four-stage global supply chain and designed the network with the objectives of maximizing profit and minimizing disruption risk. We quantified and modeled disruption risk as a function of the geographic diversification of facilities called supply density (evaluated based on the interstage distance between nodes) to mitigate the risk caused by disruptions. Furthermore, we developed a bi-criteria mixed-integer linear programming model for designing the supply chain in order to maximize profit and supply density. We propose an interactive fuzzy optimization algorithm that generates efficient frontiers by systematically taking decision-maker inputs and solves the bi-criteria model problem in the context of a realistic example. We also conducted disruption analysis using a discrete set of disruption scenarios to determine the advantages of the network design from the bi-criteria model over the traditional profit maximization model. Our study demonstrates that the network design from the bi-criteria model has a 2% higher expected profit and a 2.2% lower profit variance under disruption than the traditional profit maximization solution. We envisage that this model will help firms evaluate the trade-offs between mitigation benefits and mitigation costs.","output":"An application of interactive fuzzy optimization model for redesigning supply chain for resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To summarize current literature evidence on the role of computed tomography (CT) scan in the diagnosis and assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS Recent guidelines on the use of CT scans in COVID-19 vary between countries. However, the consensus is that it should not be used as the first line; a notion supported by the WHO. Currently, several investigations are being used including reverse transcription PCR testing, chest radiographs, and ultrasound scans, and CT scans. They are ideally performed later during the disease process as the sensitivity and specificity are highest by that time. Typical COVID-19 features on CT scans vary but include vascular enlargement, ground-glass opacities, and ground glass opacification together with consolidation. SUMMARY Since COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic, there was a push towards identifying appropriate diagnostic tests that are both reliable and effective. There is a general agreement that CT scans have a high sensitivity but low specificity in diagnosing COVID-19. However, the quality of available studies is not optimal, so this must always be interpreted with the clinical context in mind. Clinicians must aim to weigh up the practicalities and drawbacks of CT scans when considering their use for a patient. The ease and speed of use of CT scans must be balanced with their high radiation doses, and infection control considerations.","output":"The role of computed tomography scan in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Porcine post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) has reemerged as an important topic in pig production, as common control strategies based on prophylactic use of antimicrobials and zinc oxide have been deemed unsustainable. The objectives of this study were to estimate the cumulative incidence of porcine post-weaning diarrhea with different etiologies in production systems weaning without zinc oxide and prophylactic antimicrobials, to assess risk factors for post-weaning diarrhea, and to estimate the impact of post-weaning diarrhea on growth rate. A cohort study was conducted at two commercial indoor producers weaning without medicinal zinc oxide and prophylactic antimicrobials. RESULTS: Piglets were included at birth (n = 300) and 272 survived until weaning. After insertion to the nursery units, the piglets were clinically examined every day for 14 days, and rectal swabs were collected and analyzed for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and rotavirus A. The cumulative incidences of PWD the first 14 days after insertion to the nursery units were 41.8% (CI 33.6, 50.4) and 51.1% (CI 42.3, 60.0) at the two producers, respectively. We found a low incidence of cases associated to ETEC, and detected a substantial proportion of cases associated to rotavirus. We observed a biphasic pattern in the assumed etiology with rotavirus occurring first, and then a shift towards cases associated to ETEC/non-ETEC hemolytic E. coli. Being offspring of older sows was a protective factor for the development of PWD (Hazard ratio = 0.88 [CI 0.78, 0.99] per unit increase in parity of the dam). Low birth weight reduced the post-weaning growth rate (? 5.2 g/day [CI ? 7.5, ? 2.9] per 100 g decrease in birthweight) and increased the hazard of developing PWD (Hazard ratio for birthweight below 1100 g: 2.30 [CI 1.41C3.74]). The combined effect of having diarrhea for 2 days or more and receiving antimicrobial treatment was associated with an increased average daily weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests novel insights regarding pathogen dynamics and risk factors for PWD in productions not using prophylactic antimicrobials and medicinal zinc. The findings may have important implications for both antimicrobial usage and prevention strategies.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to such phenotypic variability, we compared the genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of two natural isolates of the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of the human disease melioidosis. Significant intrinsic genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic variations were observed between the two strains involving genes of diverse functions. We identified 16 strain-specific regions in the B. pseudomallei K96243 reference genome, and for eight regions their differential presence could be ascribed to either DNA acquisition or loss. A remarkable 43% of the transcriptional differences between the strains could be attributed to genes that were differentially present between K96243 and Bp15682, demonstrating the importance of lateral gene transfer or gene loss events in contributing to pathogen diversity at the gene expression level. Proteins expressed in a strain-specific manner were similarly correlated at the gene expression level, but up to 38% of the global proteomic variation between strains comprised proteins expressed in both strains but associated with strain-specific protein isoforms.

METHODS We performed a retrospective observational study in patients with HIV who were admitted to Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda between Oct 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2011. Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, HIV-positivity, and clinically diagnosed pneumonia. Exclusion criteria were contraindication to bronchoscopy or an existing diagnosis of tuberculosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected within 72 h of admission and a combination of RNA sequencing and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture plus PCR were performed. The primary outcome was detection of an established or possible respiratory pathogen in the total study population. FINDINGS We consecutively enrolled 217 patients during the study period. A potential microbial cause for pneumonia was identified in 211 (97%) patients. At least one microorganism of established respiratory pathogenicity was identified in 113 (52%) patients, and a microbe of possible pathogenicity was identified in an additional 98 (45%). M tuberculosis was the most commonly identified established pathogen (35 [16%] patients; in whom bacterial or viral co-infections were identified in 13 [37%]).

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a new laparoscopic procedure. Herein we would like to present our experiences. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2009 and October 2009, data of the 32 patients who were operated through SILS are evaluated prospectively. There were 22 females and 10 males with a mean age of 45.114.8 years. Ten splenectomies for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, 16 cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis or asymptomatic gallstones, 3 appendectomies for acute appendicitis, one distal pancreatosplenectomy for Renal Cell Cancer metastases, 1 adrenalectomy for Conn Syndrome and 1 case of liver resection for hepatic adenoma were carried out. The most common splenectomy indication was idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, cholecystectomy indication was acute cholecystitis (n=8), and asymptomatic cholelithiasis (n=8), appendectomy indication was acute appendicitis, distal pancreatosplenectomy indication was renal cell cancer metastases, adrenalectomy indication was Conn syndrome and liver resection indication was left hepatic mass in between segments 1 and 2. SILS was carried out successfully in 31 patients. Only in 1 patient conversion was required owing to bleeding. RESULTS All procedures were carried out through a 2-cm umbilical incision. There was no mortality and morbidity recorded. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands of minimally invasive surgeons, SILS incision laparoscopic surgery could be carried out successfully in a wide range of surgical operations. However, to be able to show the differences between Standard laparoscopic surgery and single SILS, prospective randomized comparative studies are required.","output":"Our early experiences with single-incision laparoscopic surgery: the first 32 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The opioid crisis in the United States may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in opioid use, emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid-related overdoses, and opioid overdose deaths have been reported. No study has examined changes in multiple naloxone administrations, an indicator of overdose severity, during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study examines changes in the occurrence of naloxone administrations and multiple naloxone administrations during EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, North Carolina (NC). METHODS: Using a period-over-period approach, we compared the occurrence of opioid-related EMS runs, naloxone administrations, and multiple naloxone administrations during the 29-week period before (September 1, 2019, to March 9, 2020) and after NC's COVID-19 state of emergency declaration (ie, the COVID-19 period of March 10 to September 30, 2020). Furthermore, historical data were used to generate a quasi-control distribution of period-over-period changes to compare the occurrence of each outcome during the COVID-19 period to each 29-week period back to January 1, 2014. RESULTS: All outcomes increased during the COVID-19 period. Compared to the previous 29 weeks, the COVID-19 period experienced increases in the weekly mean number of opioid-related EMS runs (25.6, SD 5.6 vs 18.6, SD 6.6; P<.001), naloxone administrations (22.3, SD 6.2 vs 14.1, SD 6.0; P<.001), and multiple naloxone administrations (5.0, SD 1.9 vs 2.7, SD 1.9; P<.001), corresponding to proportional increases of 37.4%, 57.8%, and 84.8%, respectively. Additionally, the increases during the COVID-19 period were greater than 91% of all historical 29-week periods analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses, naloxone administrations, and multiple naloxone administrations during EMS runs increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, NC. For a host of reasons that need to be explored, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have exacerbated the opioid crisis.","output":"Increases in Naloxone Administrations by Emergency Medical Services Providers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Time Series Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: An acute respiratory disease, known as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was identified in the late 2019. As launched by World Health Organization, it is now a pandemic problem. So far there is no any vaccine or drug for treatment to this disease. The world including Ethiopia have been relying on practicing different preventive measures. As of 17-Apr-2020, the Ethiopian health minister reported 96 confirmed cases and 3 deaths of COVID-19 from the total of 6231 laboratory tests conducted. The mainstay of approach to avoid COVID-19 is applying preventive measures. Therefore, the current survey aimed to assess self-reported measures of prevention practice and associated factors regarding COVID-19 among educated Ethiopians in the early stage of this outbreak. Methods: : An online based cross-sectional study was conducted to collect information from educated Ethiopians during the early stage of the outbreak from March 25 to April 4, 2020. Electronic based questionnaire developed by reviewing literature and revising from ''COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring comprised monitoring knowledge, risk perceptions, preventive behaviors, and public trust in the current coronavirus outbreak. Data were analyzed using SPSS-25. Results were presented using descriptive and inferential statistics. To determine predictor variables for preventive practice, a binary logistic regression model was fitted. Variables with a p-value < 0.05 in the final model were declared as predictors. Results: : Five-hundred and twenty-eight Ethiopians participated in this study of which 80.7% were males. The mean age of study participants was 33.2 (7.4) years. Above one-third (34.7%) of the participants had a health-related profession. Majority (79.7%) of the respondents attended degree and above education. Overall, above half (55.9%) of the study participants had good knowledge about COVID-19. About 55.3% and 57.8% had good knowledge regarding symptoms and prevention methods of COVID-19, respectively. Overall, above half (54%) of the respondents had good COVID-19 preventive practice.

Conclusion: The COVID-19 preventive practice is not sufficiently satisfactory among educated Ethiopians. Females, those with advanced age, those who believes presence of re-infection by COVID-19, those with good knowledge of symptoms, prevention methods, and self-protective knowhow had better preventive practice.

Herein, we analyzed whole blood samples obtained from individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, varying from mild to critical symptoms, approximately one week after symptom onset. In order to identify blood-specific markers of disease severity status, a targeted expression analysis of 143 immune-related genes was carried out by dual-color reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (dcRT-MLPA). The clinically well-defined subgroups of COVID-19 patients were compared with healthy controls. The transcriptional profile of the critically ill patients clearly separated from that of healthy individuals. Moreover, the number of differentially expressed genes increased by severity of COVID-19. It was also found that critically ill patients can be distinguished by reduced peripheral blood expression of several genes, which most likely reflects the lower lymphocyte counts. There was a notable predominance of IFN-associated gene expression in all subgroups of COVID-19, which was most profound in critically ill patients. Interestingly, the gene encoding one of the main TNF-receptors, TNFRS1A, had selectively lower expression in mild COVID-19 cases. This report provides added value in understanding COVID-19 disease, and shows potential of determining early immune transcript signatures in the blood of patients with different disease severity.

Analysis of deletion mutants of pV suggested that amino acids 81C120, 190C210, and 380C389 act as multiple nuclear localization signals (NLS), which also appear to serve as the binding sites for importin -3 protein, a member of the importin / nuclear import receptor pathway.

The presence of NoLS is essential for the production of infectious progeny virions, as deletion of both NoLs are lethal for the production of infectious BAdV-3. Analysis of mutant BAV.pVd1d3 (isolated in pV completing CRL cells) containing deletion/mutation of both NoLS in non-complementing CRL cells not only revealed the altered intracellular localization of mutant pV but also reduced the expression of some late proteins. However, it does not appear to affect the incorporation of viral proteins, including mutant pV, in BAV.pVd1d3 virions. Further analysis of CsCl purified BAV.pVd1d3 suggested the presence of thermo-labile virions with disrupted capsids, which appear to affect the infectivity of the progeny virions.

However, there are great challenges to investigate telocytes functions using primary telocytes, due to the difficulties of isolation, identification, and stability. The present study aims at constructing continuous cell strain of mouse lung telocyte cell line with stable characters by gene modification and investigating biological behaviors and responses of gene-modified telocytes to inflammation. METHODS: Mouse primary lung telocytes were isolated and identified using immune-labeling markers and immunoelectron microscopy. Primary telocytes were transformed with Simian vacuolating virus 40 small and large T antigen (SV40). Biological characters, behaviors morphology, and proliferation of those gene-modified telocytes were defined and monitored dynamically for 50 generations, as compared with primary lung telocytes. Cell cycle of mouse primary lung telocytes or gene-modified telocytes was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Gene modified telocytes of generations 5, 10, 30 and 50 were observed with telopodes and also showed CD34 and ckit positive. Multiple cellular morphology were also observed on telocyte cell-line under monitor of celliq and enhanced cell proliferation were showed. SV40 transduction was also reduced apoptosis and increased the ratio of S and G2 phases in telocyte cell-line.

Two protein-based vaccines against serogroup B infection are available for human use while four tetravalent conjugate vaccines including serogroups C, W and Y have been licensed. The tetravalent Menveo? conjugate vaccine is well-defined: a simple monomeric structure of oligosaccharides terminally conjugated to amino groups of the carrier protein CRM(197).

Understanding this phenomenon is important for the long-term goal of controlling conjugation to prepare conjugate vaccines of optimal immunogenicity.

However, testing for the presence of the virus is a major bottleneck in tracking the spreading of the disease. Given its adaptability regarding the nucleotide sequence of target regions, RT-qPCR is a strong ally to reveal the rapid geographical spreading of novel viruses. We assessed PCR variations in the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis taking into account public genome sequences and diagnosis kits used by different countries. We analyzed 226 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from samples collected by March 22, 2020. Our work utilizes a phylogenetic approach that reveals the early evolution of the virus sequence as it spreads around the globe and informs the design of RT-qPCR primers and probes. The quick expansion of testing capabilities of a country during a pandemic is largely impaired by the availability of adequately trained personnel on RNA isolation and PCR analysis, as well as the availability of hardware (thermocyclers). We propose that rapid capacity development can circumvent these bottlenecks by training medical and non-medical personnel with some laboratory experience, such as biology-related graduate students. Furthermore, the use of thermocyclers available in academic and commercial labs can be promptly calibrated and certified to properly conduct testing during a pandemic.

It is crucial to have solutions to help reduce barking quickly and humanely that are easy to understand and put into place that also do not require a lot of resources such as time, expertise, or money. This study looked at the use of an exercise (Quiet Kennel ExerciseQKE) that uses classical counterconditioning (Pavlov) to help change the way the dogs feel when a person enters the kennel area from unpleasant to pleasant. This should help to reduce barking, especially that which is caused by negative emotions such as fear and frustration. After the initial baseline period of 5 days, people passing through the kennel tossed treats to the dogs no matter what the dogs did for 10 days. Data was collected three times a day for the entire study period. Sound level readings (decibels), number of dogs present, and number of dogs barking were recorded. Results showed improvement in the loudest volume recorded after the exercise was in place, fewer dogs barking over time, and each dog barking less each time. The most improvement was noticed in the afternoon. ABSTRACT: Excessive barking is a major source of noise pollution in dog kennels and negatively impacts welfare. Because resources are often limited, minimizing barking in the simplest and most easily implementable way is imperative. This pilot study implemented a Quiet Kennel Exercise (QKE) that utilized classical counterconditioning to change the dogs negative emotional state (which can lead to barking) to a more positive emotional state. Therefore, barking motivation is reduced, so barking should decrease. This study aims to show proof of concept that decreasing barking through classical counterconditioning is effective. It was conducted in one ward of day-time boarding kennels at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Data was collected three times per day and included decibel readings, number of dogs present, and number of dogs barking during a 5-day initial baseline and 10-day intervention period. During baseline, people passing through the ward acted as they normally would. During intervention, passersby were asked to simply toss each dog a treat regardless of the dogs behaviors in the kennel. Descriptive results show improvement in maximum level of barking after QKE, fewer dogs barking over time, dogs barking less each time, and the most improvement noted in the afternoon.","output":"Impact of Classical Counterconditioning (Quiet Kennel Exercise) on Barking in Kenneled DogsA Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Huntington disease (HD) is an ideal model for investigating selective neurodegeneration, as expanded polyQ repeats in the ubiquitously expressed huntingtin (HTT) cause the preferential neurodegeneration in the striatum of the HD patient brains.

DESIGN Thirty-two international experts, four methodologists, and four critical illness survivors met virtually at least monthly. All section groups gathered face-to-face at annual Society of Critical Care Medicine congresses; virtual connections included those unable to attend. A formal conflict of interest policy was developed a priori and enforced throughout the process. Teleconferences and electronic discussions among subgroups and whole panel were part of the guidelines' development. A general content review was completed face-to-face by all panel members in January 2017. METHODS Content experts, methodologists, and ICU survivors were represented in each of the five sections of the guidelines: Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption). Each section created Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome, and nonactionable, descriptive questions based on perceived clinical relevance. The guideline group then voted their ranking, and patients prioritized their importance. For each Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome question, sections searched the best available evidence, determined its quality, and formulated recommendations as \\"strong,\\" \\"conditional,\\" or \\"good\\" practice statements based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation principles. In addition, evidence gaps and clinical caveats were explicitly identified. RESULTS The Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption) panel issued 37 recommendations (three strong and 34 conditional), two good practice statements, and 32 ungraded, nonactionable statements. Three questions from the patient-centered prioritized question list remained without recommendation. CONCLUSIONS We found substantial agreement among a large, interdisciplinary cohort of international experts regarding evidence supporting recommendations, and the remaining literature gaps in the assessment, prevention, and treatment of Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility (mobilization/rehabilitation), and Sleep (disruption) in critically ill adults.

Results: Most of the participating managers had difficulty completing the entire training program in this intervention project due to external circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and re-organisations, and because no extra time during working hours had been allocated to the managers to participate in the intervention project. Despite this, all participating managers appreciated being given the opportunity to participate and take part in the content of the intervention. Everyone considered the theoretical model, the wage model, on which the intervention project was based, to be very useful and to have given them new insights into their managerial duties. Conclusions: If society and organisations want a larger amount of employees to participate in working life until an older age, they also need to allocate working hours for managers to acquire new knowledge on how to create healthy and sustainable workplaces for all ages, as well as to implement these tools, measures and working methods permanently in the daily organisational work. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Management, Measures and Maintenance: Success and Setbacks in Interventions Promoting a Healthy and Sustainable Employability and Working Life for All Ages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, a new member of the Coronaviridae family, officially designated as \\"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\\" (SARS-CoV-2), emerged and spread rapidly. The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak was accompanied by a high rate of morbidity and mortality worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Within the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be the third most highly pathogenic virus that infects humans, following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Four major mechanisms are thought to be involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis, including the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) signaling pathway, oxidative stress and cell death, cytokine storm, and endothelial dysfunction. Following virus entry and RAS activation, acute respiratory distress syndrome develops with an oxidative/nitrosative burst. The DNA damage induced by oxidative stress activates poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1), viral macrodomain of non-structural protein 3, poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), and transient receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2) channel in a sequential manner which results in cell apoptosis or necrosis. In this review, blockers of angiotensin II receptor and/or PARP, PARG, and TRPM2, including vitamin D3, trehalose, tannins, flufenamic and mefenamic acid, and losartan, have been investigated for inhibiting RAS activation and quenching oxidative burst. Moreover, the application of organic and inorganic nanoparticles, including liposomes, dendrimers, quantum dots, and iron oxides, as therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2 were fully reviewed. In the present review, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are explained by focusing on molecular mechanisms.

Surveillance based on case reporting has become the core pandemic monitoring method in the country and globally. However, population-based seroprevalence studies may provide an unbiased estimate of the actual disease spread and, in combination with multiple surveillance tools, help to define the pandemic course. This study summarises results from four consecutive serological surveys conducted between May 2020 and April 2021 at St.Petersburg, Russia and combines them with other SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data. Methods: We conducted four serological surveys of two random samples (May-June, July-August, October--December 2020, and February-April 2021) from adults residing in St.Petersburg recruited with the random digit dialing (RDD), accompanied by a telephone interview to collect information on both individuals who accepted and declined the invitation for testing and account for non-response. We have used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay CoronaPass total antibodies test (Genetico, Moscow, Russia) to report seroprevalence. We corrected the estimates for non-response using the bivariate probit model and also accounted the test performance characteristics, obtained from independent assay evaluation. In addition, we have summarised the official registered cases statistics, the number of hospitalised patients, the number of COVID-19 deaths, excess deaths, tests performed, data from the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) surveillance, the vaccination uptake, and St. Petersburg search and mobility trends. The infection fatality ratios (IFR) have been calculated using the Bayesian evidence synthesis model. Findings: After calling 113,017 random mobile phones we have reached 14,118 individuals who responded to computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and 2,413 provided blood samples at least once through the seroprevalence study. The adjusted seroprevalence in May-June, 2020 was 9.7% (95%: 7.7-11.7), 13.3% (95% 9.9-16.6) in July-August, 2020, 22.9% (95%: 20.3-25.5) in October-December, 2021 and 43.9% (95%: 39.7-48.0) in February-April, 2021. History of any symptoms, history of COVID-19 tests, and non-smoking status were significant predictors for higher seroprevalence. Most individuals remained seropositive with a maximum 10 months follow-up. 92.7% (95% CI 87.9-95.7) of participants who have reported at least one vaccine dose were seropositive. Hospitalisation and COVID-19 death statistics and search terms trends reflected the pandemic course better than the official case count, especially during the spring 2020. SARS-CoV-2 circulation showed rather low genetic SARS-CoV-2 lineages diversity that increased in the spring 2021. Local VOC (AT.1) was spreading till April 2021, but B.1.617.2 substituted all other lineages by June 2021. The IFR based on the excess deaths was equal to 1.04 (95% CI 0.80-1.31) for the adult population and 0.86% (95% CI 0.66-1.08) for the entire population. Conclusion: Approximately one year after the COVID-19 pandemic about 45% of St. Petersburg, Russia residents contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection in, or 2.2 mln people. Combined with vaccination uptake of about 10% it was enough to slow the pandemic until the Delta VOC started to spread.

Experimentally, the different PDMS materials led to similar numbers of attached bacteria, which can be rationalized by the identical energy barriers simulated between bacteria and the different materials. However, different numbers of residual bacteria after detachment were observed, which was suggested by simulation that the detachment process is determined by the interfacial physicochemistry rather than the mechanical property of a material. This finding is further supported by analyzing the bacteria detachment from PDMS substrates from which non-crosslinked polymer chains had been removed: similar numbers of residual bacteria were found on the extracted PDMS substrates.

METHODS: In a sample (n = 398) of heterosexual and gay men and women, we evaluated the drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, and bulimic symptomatology. Using ANCOVAs, we analyzed the differences in symptoms score according to sex, sexual orientation and relational status including body mass index (BMI) as covariate; we also evaluated the mediating role of drive for thinness in the relationship between sexual orientation and body dissatisfaction. RESULTS: We found an increased drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction in men-attracted compared with women-attracted participants; also, body dissatisfaction was greater in women than in men. Heterosexual women presented higher bulimia scores than lesbian women. Gay men open to relationships presented higher drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction scores than those not-open to relationships. Finally, differences in body dissatisfaction between gay and heterosexual men were fully explained by drive for thinness, while, in the case of women, drive for thinness only partially explained these differences. CONCLUSIONS: Attraction to men seems to be a risk factor for EDs in the case of gay men and heterosexual women. In addition, in the case of heterosexual women, other factors independent of the desire to attract men seem to be important.","output":"Sexual attraction to men as a risk factor for eating disorders: the role of mating expectancies and drive for thinness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease) can induce systemic vascular involvement contributing to morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial and endothelial cells through the ACE2 receptor. The anatomical involvement of the coronary tree is not explored yet. METHODS: Cardiac autopsy tissue of the entire coronary tree (main coronary arteries, epicardial arterioles/venules, epicardial capillaries) and epicardial nerves were analyzed in COVID-19 patients (n = 6). All anatomical regions were immunohistochemically tested for ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68 and IL-6. COVID-19 negative patients with cardiovascular disease (n = 3) and influenza A (n = 6) served as controls. FINDINGS: COVID-19 positive patients showed strong ACE2 / TMPRSS2 expression in capillaries and less in arterioles/venules. The main coronary arteries were virtually devoid of ACE2 receptor and had only mild intimal inflammation. Epicardial capillaries had a prominent lympho-monocytic endotheliitis, which was less pronounced in arterioles/venules. The lymphocytic-monocytic infiltrate strongly expressed CD4, CD45, CD68. Peri/epicardial nerves had strong ACE2 expression and lympho-monocytic inflammation. COVID-19 negative patients showed minimal vascular ACE2 expression and lacked endotheliitis or inflammatory reaction. INTERPRETATION: ACE2 / TMPRSS2 expression and lymphomonocytic inflammation in COVID-19 disease increases crescentically towards the small vessels suggesting that COVID-19-induced endotheliitis is a small vessel vasculitis not involving the main coronaries. The inflammatory neuropathy of epicardial nerves in COVID-19 disease provides further evidence of an angio- and neurotrophic affinity of SARS-COV2 and might potentially contribute to the understanding of the high prevalence of cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmias in COVID-19.

Thus, our goal was to evaluate binding of antibodies from sera of infected and vaccinated people to different antigens expressed by SARS-CoV-2 variants. MethodsWe compared sera from vaccinated donors with sera from four patient/donor cohorts: critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit (split in sera collected between 2 and 7 days after admission and more than ten days later), a NIBSC/WHO reference panel of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, and ambulatory or hospitalized (but not critically ill) positive donors. Samples were tested with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG serological assay designed with microplates coated with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD recombinant antigen. The same sample sets were also tested with microplates coated with antigens harbouring RBD mutations present in eleven of the most widespread variants. ResultsSera from vaccinated individuals exhibited higher antibody binding (P<0.001) than sera from infected (but not critically ill) individuals when tested against the WT and each of 11 variants RBD. The optical density generated by sera from non-critically ill convalescence individuals upon binding to variants antigens was different (P<0.05) from that of the WT in some variants--noteworthy, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Delta Plus variants.

Sadly, this remains true even as we suffer the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Whilst current chemo- and radiotherapeutic treatment strategies have significantly improved the patient survival rate, disease reoccurrence continues to pose a deadly risk for all too many patients. Incomplete removal of tumour cells from the body increases the chances of metastasis and developing resistance against current treatments. Immunotherapy represents a therapeutic modality that has helped to overcome these limitations in recent decades. However, further progress is needed. So-called immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a recently discovered and unique mode of cell death that could trigger this necessary further progress. ICD involves stimulation of a tumour-specific immune response as a downstream effect. Facilitated by certain treatment modalities, cells undergoing ICD can trigger the IFN-?3 mediated immune response involving cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and ?3? T cells that eradicate residual tumour cells. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of small-molecules being tested as potential ICD inducers. A large number of these ICD inducers are metal-based complexes. In fact, anticancer metal drugs based on Pt, Ru, Ir, Cu, and Au are now known to give rise to an immune response against tumour cells as the result of ICD. Advances have also been made in terms of exploiting combinatorial and delivery strategies.

In the quarantined group, higher depressive, anxiety, and stress scores were associated with the female gender and with lower resilience scores but were not linked to age, psychiatric history, medical history, duration of quarantine, or religiosity. CONCLUSION: The elderly population does not seem to develop significant COVID-19 quarantine-related psychological distress, possibly thanks to high resilience and effective coping strategies developed through the years.","output":"Mental Health, resilience, and religiosity in the elderly under COVID-19 quarantine in Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Spanish Flu was one of the disasters in the history of Iran, especially Southern Iran, which led to the death of a significant number of people in Iran.

Some sparse case reports have described various forms of encephalitis in COVID-19 disease, but very few data have focused on clinical presentations, clinical course, response to treatment and outcomes. METHODS: The ENCOVID multicentre study included patients with encephalitis with full infectious screening, CSF, EEG, MRI data and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recruited from 13 centres in northern Italy. Clinical presentation and laboratory markers, severity of COVID-19 disease, response to treatment and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: twenty-five cases of encephalitis positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia and/or pleocytosis in 68% of cases whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR resulted negative. Based on MRI, cases were classified as ADEM (n=3), limbic encephalitis (LE, n=2), encephalitis with normal imaging (n=13) and encephalitis with MRI alterations (n=7). ADEM and LE cases showed a delayed onset compared to the other encephalitis (p=0.001) and were associated with previous more severe COVID-19 respiratory involvement. Patients with MRI alterations exhibited worse response to treatment and final outcomes compared to other encephalitis.

However, it remains unknown how the reliability of responses to these tools may be compromised by individual and social factors. We aimed to determine whether personal concern over lost wages impacts responses to COVID-19 symptom-screening questionnaires making them less useful in limiting person-to-person transmission. METHODS: We utilized an anonymous online questionnaire, administered through personal social media networks and those of two U.S. private colleges between September 16, 2020 and November 2, 2020 and distributed to currently or recently employed individuals 18 years of age or older. Participants considered ambiguous hypothetical scenarios involving possible COVID-19 symptoms or exposure and responded to a COVID-19 symptom screen (N = 219). FINDINGS: In response to symptom-related scenarios (i.e., elevated temperature or slight cough), respondents lacking access to paid sick leave were 2.2 to 2.7 times more likely to attend work than those with access to paid leave (p < .05). This was not true for contact-related scenarios. Pay type and income level also significantly influenced screening responses. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Risk of acute wage loss and overall financial stability appear to influence work-attendance decisions with regard to COVID-19 symptom screens.

Our understanding of the origin and evolution of the pandemic has shifted considerably. We review evidence of the characteristic age-related pattern of death during the 1918 pandemic relative to the original antigenic sin hypothesis. We analyze age-stratified mortality data from Copenhagen around 1918 to identify break points associated with unusual death risk. Whereas infants had no meaningful risk elevation, death risk gradually increased, peaking for young adults 20C34 years of age before dropping sharply for adults ages 35C44 years, suggesting break points for birth cohorts around 1908 and 1878. Taken together with data from previous studies, there is strong evidence that those born before 1878 or after 1908 were not at increased risk of dying of 1918 pandemic influenza. Although the peak death risk coincided with the 1889C1892 pandemic, the 1908 and 1878 break points do not correspond with known pandemics.

The virus is likely to show seasonal dynamics in European climates as other respiratory viruses and coronaviruses do. Analysing the association with meteorological factors might be helpful to anticipate how cases will develop with changing seasons. METHODS: Routinely measured ambient daily mean temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity were the explanatory variables of this analysis. Test-positive COVID-19 cases represented the outcome variable. The analysis included 54 English cities. A two-stage meta-regression was conducted. At the first stage, we used a quasi-Poisson generalized linear model including distributed lag non-linear elements. Thereby, we investigate the explanatory variables' non-linear effects as well as the non-linear effects across lags. RESULTS: This study found a non-linear association of COVID-19 cases with temperature. At 11.9C there was 1.62-times (95%-CI: 1.44; 1.81) the risk of cases compared to the temperature-level with the smallest risk (21.8C). Absolute humidity exhibited a 1.61-times (95%-CI: 1.41; 1.83) elevated risk at 6.6 g/m3 compared to the centering at 15.1 g/m3.

Data is emerging that smell impairment is a prominent symptom in COVID-19 and that this coronavirus behaves differently in causing olfactory dysfunction compared to other respiratory viruses. Anosmia and hyposmia, the complete and partial loss of smell, respectively, can result from many causes, most commonly from viral infections, sinonasal disease, and head trauma. Olfactory dysfunction negatively impacts quality of life, as sense of smell is important for flavor perception and the enjoyment of food. Olfaction is also important for the detection of warning smells, such as smoke, natural gas leaks, and spoiled food. Allergists and immunologists frequently encounter anosmia and hyposmia in patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and will likely see more infection-induced olfactory dysfunction in the era of COVID-19. Therefore, now more than ever, is crucial that we understand this impairment, how to evaluate and how to measure it. In this review, we offer a clinically relevant primer for the allergist and immunologist on olfactory dysfunction subtypes, exploring the pathophysiology, appropriate clinical assessment, objective smell testing, and management.

The ability of a plant to survive stress is a complex phenomenon. One of the essential tissues for plant performance under various environmental stimuli is the crown. However, the molecular characterization of this region remains poorly investigated. Gibberellins play a fundamental role in whole-plant stature formation. This study identified plant stature modifications and crown-specific transcriptome re-modeling in gibberellin-deficient barley sdw1.a (BW827) and sdw1.d (BW828) mutants exposed to increased temperature. RESULTS The deletion around the sdw1 gene in BW827 was found to encompass at least 13 genes with primarily regulatory functions. A bigger genetic polymorphism of BW828 than of BW827 in relation to wild type was revealed. Transcriptome-wide sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed several differentially expressed genes involved in gibberellin metabolism and heat response located outside of introgression regions. It was found that HvGA20ox4, a paralogue of the HvGA20ox2 gene, was upregulated in BW828 relative to other genotypes, which manifested as basal internode elongation. The transcriptome response to elevated temperature differed in the crown of sdw1.a and sdw1.d mutants; it was most contrasting for HvHsf genes upregulated under elevated temperature in BW828, whereas those specific to BW827 were downregulated. In-depth examination of sdw1 mutants revealed also some differences in their phenotypes and physiology. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that despite the studied sdw1 mutants being genetically related, their heat response seemed to be genotype-specific and observed differences resulted from genetic background diversity rather than single gene mutation, multiple gene deletion, or allele-specific expression of the HvGA20ox2 gene. Differences in the expressional reaction of genes to heat in different sdw1 mutants, found to be independent of the polymorphism, could be further explained by in-depth studies of the regulatory factors acting in the studied system. Our findings are particularly important in genetic research area since molecular response of crown tissue has been marginally investigated, and can be useful for wide genetic research of crops since barley has become a model plant for them.","output":"High-throughput sequencing data revealed genotype-specific changes evoked by heat stress in crown tissue of barley sdw1 near-isogenic lines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than ever, optimal influenza vaccination coverage among healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial to avoid absenteeism and disruption of health services, as well as in-hospital influenza outbreaks.

Purposely curated and aggregated data from individual research groups can fulfil this unmet need, resulting in rich resources for psychiatric research. Methods and analyses: As part of the Cardiff MRC Mental Health Data Pathfinder, we have curated and harmonised phenotypic and genetic information from 15 studies within the MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics to create a new data repository, DRAGON-DATA. To date, DRAGON-DATA includes over 45,000 individuals: adults or children with psychiatric diagnoses, affected probands with family members and individuals who carry a known neurodevelopmental copy number variant (ND-CNV). We have processed the available phenotype information to derive core variables that can be reliably analysed across groups. In addition, all datasets with genotype information have undergone rigorous quality control, imputation, CNV calling and polygenic score generation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine patients perspective on adoption of telehealth as a response to the pandemic and its sustainability in the future. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Following a COVID-19 outbreak, 101 patients with advanced genitourinary cancers are currently managed virtually for therapy administration at our tertiary care unit. They were surveyed about the current situation, and current and long-term employment of telehealth. INTERVENTION: Rapid implementation of virtual patient management. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Patients perception of anxiety of COVID-19 and cancer, perspective on telehealth measures as a reaction to the current COVID-19 pandemic, and long-term acceptance were used as outcomes. Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank test, chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney U test were performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 101 patients, 92 answered the questionnaire, with 71 (77.2%) responding virtually by e-mail or phone call. Anxiety of cancer (6/10, interquartile range [IQR] 3C8) superseded that of COVID-19 (four/10, IQR 2C5.25, p < 0.001), and patients oppose temporary treatment interruption. Of the patients, 66.0% perceive their susceptibility to COVID-19 as equal to or lower than the general population and 52.2% believe that COVID-19 will not affect their therapy. In future, patients (62.6%) prefer to maintain in-person appointments as opposed to complete remote care, but accept remote care during the pandemic (eight/10, IQR 5C9). Beyond the crisis, maintaining telehealth has low preference rates (four/10, IQR 2C7), with high acceptance for external laboratory controls (60.9%) and online visit management (48.9%), but lower acceptance for remote treatment planning including staging discussions (44.6%) and for referral to secondary care oncologists (17.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the pandemic, cancer remains the key concern and patients are not willing to compromise on their treatment. Rapid implementation of telehealth is tolerated well during the need of social distancing, with a clear red line concerning changes in existing patient-physician relationships. Balancing future implementation of telehealth while considering patients demand for personal relationships will ensure human dignity in uro-oncology.

Acceptance of telehealth during the current situation is high; however, long-term implementation of the adapted services is less favored. We deduce that patient-physician relationship is crucial for cancer patients and needs to be balanced against measures for social distancing to forge the future management.","output":"Telehealth in Uro-oncology Beyond the Pandemic: Toll or Lifesaver?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Caring for an individual with an eating disorder involves guilt, distress and many extra burdens and unmet needs. This qualitative study explored the experiences of parents with adult daughters suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa and the strategies they adopted. A subsidiary aim of the study was to explore the relationship between the caregivers perceived need for professional support and the support they reported receiving in practice from the health services. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 mothers and fathers from across Norway. Data collection, coding and analysis was conducted using the principles of constructivist grounded theory in an iterative process. The main concern shared by participants was identified by this process and their solution to the main concern then formed the content of the core category. RESULTS: Wearing all the hats emerged as the core category, indicating that the parents have to fulfil several roles to compensate the lack of help from health services. The three subcategories: adapting to the illness, struggling for understanding and help and continuing to stay strong described how the participants handled their situation as parents of adult daughters with eating disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In daily life, the parents of adults with eating disorders have to attend to a wide range of caregiver tasks to help their ill daughters. This study suggests that the health services that treat adults with eating disorders should be coordinated, with a professional carer in charge. The parents need easy access to information about the illness and its treatment. They also need professional support for themselves in a demanding situation.","output":"The experiences and strategies of parents of adults with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 or Covid-19 pandemic has affected many operations worldwide.

We examined the relationship between self-employment and cardiovascular risk among the general population in the United States from 1999 to 2016. Methods Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we identified all patients with hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), diabetes mellitus (DM), stroke, heart failure (HF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) between 1999 and 2016. Type of job was defined based on the participants response to the survey question as an employee of a private company, business, or individual for wages, salary, or commission or self-employed in own business, professional practice or farm. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to adjust for confounders. Results Of 30,103 patients, 2,835 (9.4%) were self-employed in their own business, professional practice, or farm and 27,268 (90.6%) were employed by a private company, business, or government. After adjusting for age, race, sex, BMI, marital status, educational level, health insurance status, smoking status, sleep duration and lipid profiles, self-employed individuals had a higher prevalence of HTN (OR: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 - 1.20), HLD (OR: 1.10; 95% CI 1.07 - 1.31), stroke (OR: 1.45; 95% CI 1.27 - 1.67), HF (OR: 1.17; 95% CI 1.03 - 1.32), and CAD (OR: 1.26; 95% CI 1.13 - 1.35) (all P < 0.05).

Further prospective studies are urgently needed to establish the optimal preventive strategy to reduce cardiovascular risks in self-employed individuals.","output":"Self-employment and Cardiovascular Risk in the US General Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A crisis is an immediate threat to the functioning of society, while disaster is an actual manifestation of a crisis. Both are now even more critically socially constructed. In the middle of battle with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic of Croatia's capital of Zagreb was afflicted with another disaster - two severe earthquakes. Restrictive public health measures were already in place, including restriction on public transport, travel between regions, closure of educational and other public institutions, alongside measures of physical distancing. Most previous cases of COVID-19 were centered in Zagreb, leading to concern of spreading the disease into disease-free communities. It seems that earthquakes did not have an effect on disease transmission - the number of COVID-19 cases remained stable through the 14-day incubation period, with a linear pandemic curve in Croatia in April, and flattened in May. This leads to a conclusion that the earthquake did not have a direct effect on disease spread. Despite the fact that the current pandemic and its responses are unique, this paradox can have interesting repercussions on how we conceptualize and approach notions as vulnerability and resilience.","output":"Double jeopardy; What happens when an epidemic is followed by an earthquake?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Systemic antimicrobials can be used as an adjunct to mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing (SRP)) as a non-surgical treatment approach to manage periodontitis. A range of antibiotics with different dosage and combinations are documented in the literature. The review follows the previous classification of periodontitis as all included studies used this classification. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of systemic antimicrobials as an adjunct to SRP for the non-surgical treatment of patients with periodontitis. SEARCH METHODS Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 9 March 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which involved individuals with clinically diagnosed untreated periodontitis. Trials compared SRP with systemic antibiotics versus SRP alone/placebo, or with other systemic antibiotics. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We included 45 trials conducted worldwide involving 2664 adult participants. 14 studies were at low, 8 at high, and the remaining 23 at unclear overall risk of bias. Seven trials did not contribute data to the analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for the 10 comparisons which reported long-term follow-up ( 1 year). None of the studies reported data on antimicrobial resistance and patient-reported quality of life changes. Amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD -16.20%, 95% CI -25.87 to -6.53; 1 study, 44 participants); clinical attachment level (CAL) (MD -0.47 mm, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.05; 2 studies, 389 participants); probing pocket depth (PD) (MD -0.30 mm, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.18; 2 studies, 389 participants); and percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP) (MD -8.06%, 95% CI -14.26 to -1.85; 2 studies, 389 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for closed pockets and BOP showed a minimally important clinical difference (MICD) favouring amoxicillin + metronidazole + SRP. Metronidazole + SRP versus SRP in chronic/aggressive periodontitis: the evidence for percentage of closed pockets (MD -12.20%, 95% CI -29.23 to 4.83; 1 study, 22 participants); CAL (MD -1.12 mm, 95% CI -2.24 to 0; 3 studies, 71 participants); PD (MD -1.11 mm, 95% CI -2.84 to 0.61; 2 studies, 47 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD -6.90%, 95% CI -22.10 to 8.30; 1 study, 22 participants) was of very low certainty. Only the results for CAL and PD showed an MICD favouring the MTZ + SRP group. Azithromycin + SRP versus SRP for chronic/aggressive periodontitis: we found no evidence of a difference in percentage of closed pockets (MD 2.50%, 95% CI -10.19 to 15.19; 1 study, 40 participants); CAL (MD -0.59 mm, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.08; 2 studies, 110 participants); PD (MD -0.77 mm, 95% CI -2.33 to 0.79; 2 studies, 110 participants); and percentage of BOP (MD -1.28%, 95% CI -4.32 to 1.76; 2 studies, 110 participants) (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Amoxicillin + clavulanate + SRP versus SRP for chronic periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 21 participants for CAL (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.71); PD (MD 0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.37); and BOP (MD 0%, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.09) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Doxycycline + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 22 participants for CAL (MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.49 to -0.11); and PD (MD -1.00 mm, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.22) was of very low certainty, with the doxycycline + SRP group showing an MICD in PD only. Tetracycline + SRP versus SRP for aggressive periodontitis: we found very low-certainty evidence of a difference in long-term improvement in CAL for the tetracycline group (MD -2.30 mm, 95% CI -2.50 to -2.10; 1 study, 26 participants). Clindamycin + SRP versus SRP in aggressive periodontitis: we found very low-certainty evidence from 1 study, 21 participants of a difference in long-term improvement in CAL (MD -1.70 mm, 95% CI -2.40 to -1.00); and PD (MD -1.80 mm, 95% CI -2.47 to -1.13) favouring clindamycin + SRP. Doxycycline + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: there was very low-certainty evidence from 1 study, 27 participants of a difference in long-term CAL (MD 1.10 mm, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84); and PD (MD 1.00 mm, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.70) favouring metronidazole + SRP. Clindamycin + SRP versus metronidazole + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 26 participants for CAL (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.95); and PD (MD 0.20 mm, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.78) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Clindamycin + SRP versus doxycycline + SRP for aggressive periodontitis: the evidence from 1 study, 23 participants for CAL (MD -0.90 mm, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.18); and PD (MD -0.80 mm, 95% CI -1.58 to -0.02) was of very low certainty and did not show a difference between the groups. Most trials testing amoxicillin, metronidazole, and azithromycin reported adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mild gastrointestinal disturbances, and metallic taste. No serious adverse events were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is very low-certainty evidence (for long-term follow-up) to inform clinicians and patients if adjunctive systemic antimicrobials are of any help for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis. There is insufficient evidence to decide whether some antibiotics are better than others when used alongside SRP. None of the trials reported serious adverse events but patients should be made aware of the common adverse events related to these drugs. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted clearly defining the minimally important clinical difference for the outcomes closed pockets, CAL, PD, and BOP.","output":"Adjunctive systemic antimicrobials for the non-surgical treatment of periodontitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patent is an important outcome of technological innovation.

Clinical data and outcomes were registered. Superinfection was defined as a bacterial or fungal infection that occurred 48 h after hospital admission. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors independently associated with superinfections. RESULTS: Overall, 315 patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized and 109 episodes of superinfections were documented in 69 (21.9%) patients. The median time from admission to superinfection was 19 days (range 11C29.75). Superinfections were caused by Enterobacterales (44.9%), non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (15.6%), Gram-positive bacteria (15.6%) and fungi (5.5%). Polymicrobial infections accounted for 18.3%. Predictors of superinfections were: intestinal colonization by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (OR 16.03, 95% CI 6.5C39.5, P < 0.001); invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4C13.1, P < 0.001); immunomodulatory agents (tocilizumab/baricitinib) (OR 5.09, 95% CI 2.2C11.8, P < 0.001); C-reactive protein on admission >7 mg/dl (OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.7C7.7, P = 0.001); and previous treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.1C7.2, P = 0.028).

We suggest that healthcare workers be designated to care exclusively for patients with COVID-19, whenever possible, as another approach to minimize nosocomial spread. This approach may also be beneficial in conserving limited supplies of reusable personal protective equipment (PPE). We recommend that visitors be restricted for patients with COVID-19. In settings where family members or visitors are necessary for caregiving, we recommend that the appropriate PPE be used by visitors. We also recommend that education regarding hand hygiene and donning/doffing procedures for PPE be provided.

EXPERIENCE: Six pregnant patients were admitted with severe or critical COVID-19 at Massachusetts General Hospital from April to June 2020 and received inhalational nitric oxide therapy. All patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A total of 39 treatments was administered. An improvement in cardiopulmonary function was observed after commencing nitric oxide gas, as evidenced by an increase in systemic oxygenation in each administration session among those with evidence of baseline hypoxemia and reduction of tachypnea in all patients in each session. Three patients delivered a total of four neonates during hospitalization. At 28-day follow-up, all three patients were home and their newborns were in good condition. Three of the six patients remain pregnant after hospital discharge. Five patients had two negative test results on nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 within 28 days from admission.

In this work, in-duct disinfectors based on grating-like dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasmas with varied electrode arrangements were established and evaluated. The highest airborne bacterial inactivation efficiency was achieved by vertical structure, namely when aerosol was in direct contact with the discharge region, at a given discharge power. For all reactors, the efficiency is linearly correlated to the discharge power (R2=0.929-0.994). The effects of environmental factors were examined. Decreased airflow rates boost the efficiency, which reaches 99.8% at the velocity of 0.5m/s with an aerosol residence time of ~3.6-9 ms. Increasing humidity (RH=20-60%) contributed to inactivation efficacy, while high humidity (RH=70%-90%) leads to a saturated efficiency, possibly due to the disruption of discharge uniformity. As suggested by the plasma effluent treatment and scavenger experiments, gaseous short-lived chemical species or charged particles are concluded as the major agents accounting for bacterial inactivation. This research provides new hints for air disinfection by DBD plasmas.","output":"In-duct Grating-like Dielectric Barrier Discharge System for Air Disinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic security of any company depends on its solvency and financial stability. It is also affected by uneven economic development due to the global financial crises, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increased competition from industrial and commercial companies, and military conflicts. Thus, it is necessary to assess the stability of companies as a basis for their economic security, taking into account the indicators of solvency and financial stability. The paper used systematization, comparative analysis, ranking, expert interview (in-depth interview), and Fishburne's method. First, the scheme of ensuring the financial stability and solvency of production and trading companies is proposed. Second, the evaluation indicators system is developed, and the rating scale of stability of production and trading companies is determined. According to the results, evaluation indicators were formed;some were calculated according to companies' financial statements and management accounting. Finally, to increase the efficiency of technical and economic parameters, areas for regulating the activities of companies and ensuring their stability were identified. According to an in-depth interview with experts, the sampled company received 69 points and corresponded to a sufficient level of stability. Factors that negatively affected the stability of companies' activities include quality indicators, namely compliance with standards, company image, digitalization, compliance with corporate culture, and personnel management policy. ? 2022 The author(s).","output":"Stability of Production and Trading Companies Considering Their Economic Security"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a method of mapping data from publicly available genomics and publication resources to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and implement a server to publish linked open data (LOD).

In this study, research is conducted on efficiently detecting imaging features of this type of pneumonia using deep convolutional neural networks in a large dataset. It is demonstrated that simple models, alongside the majority of pretrained networks in the literature, focus on irrelevant features for decision-making. In this paper, numerous chest x-ray images from various sources are collected, and the largest publicly accessible dataset is prepared. Finally, using the transfer learning paradigm, the well-known CheXNet model is utilized for developing COVID-CXNet.

We assessed differences by HIV status and associations between social disruption and psychosocial health. DESIGN: A cross-sectional telephone/videoconference administered survey of 3411 PLHIV and HIV-negative participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS). METHODS: An instrument combining new and validated measures was developed to assess COVID-19 prevention efforts, social disruptions (loss of employment, childcare, health insurance, and financial supports), experiences of abuse, and psychosocial health. Interviews were performed between April and June 2020. Associations between social disruptions and psychosocial health were explored using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for sociodemographics and HIV status. RESULTS: Almost all (97.4%) participants reported COVID-19 prevention behavior; 40.1% participants reported social disruptions, and 34.3% reported health care appointment disruption. Men living with HIV were more likely than HIV-negative men to experience social disruptions (40.6% vs. 32.9%; P < 0.01), whereas HIV-negative women were more likely than women with HIV to experience social disruptions (51.1% vs. 39.8%, P < 0.001). Participants who experienced 2 social disruptions had significantly higher odds of depression symptoms [aOR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 1.56], anxiety (aOR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.17 to 2.27), and social support dissatisfaction (aOR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.60).

Stress-related sleep disturbance is an established transdiagnostic risk factor; thus, identifying associations with coping strategies may inform future intervention efforts. The current study examined secondary control-oriented coping strategies, including positive reappraisal, which may be particularly effective in the context of stressors characterized by high uncertainty and low controllability such as a pandemic. METHOD: The current study (total N = 227 undergraduate students, predominantly female) examined the associations among primary and secondary control-oriented coping strategies, positive and negative affect (PA, NA), and the development of acute sleep disturbance in the month after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Control of prepandemic reported sleep disturbance allowed for prospective analyses of pandemic-related change. RESULTS: Participants reported high levels of stress due to the pandemic onset, including difficulties with time management, difficulties with work or school, and worry about the future. Reappraisal and acceptance were both associated with higher concurrent PA, lower NA, and less increase in sleep disturbance; however, positive reappraisal was the only coping strategy that predicted unique variance in increased sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings add to our understanding of stress adaptation in response to stressors characterized by high severity, high uncertainty, and low controllability, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and suggest that positive reappraisal and PA may foster resilience to stress-related sleep disturbance.

Vulnerable populations, specifically those suffering from serious mental illness and homelessness, are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection resulting in medical complications and psychiatric destabilization. In addition, mental health has become increasingly relevant throughout the country given the psychological distress people have been facing due to the spread of COVID-19 and the toll of a more restricted way of living. Although the healthcare industry has quickly integrated novel ways of treating patients with mental illness with technological advances, these technologies are not applicable to different populations equally. There is a clear disparity that is represented within the public county health systems, which leads to a widening gap between those who receive adequate treatment for mental illness and those who do not. AIMS: The aims of this paper were to provide a commentary on the benefits of technology-based psychiatric and psychological interventions based off experience in a public health system and based off a relevant, thorough literature review. In addition, we aim to highlight the importance of accessibility of these interventions for vulnerable populations and provide recommendations for integrating these services expeditiously. METHODS: Literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar. CONCLUSIONS: Based off data collected from experience in a public health system and literature review, we conclude that although the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated significant innovation to integrate technology for psychiatric care, this innovation is not equally accessible for vulnerable populations suffering from mental health disorders. Within a public county health system, there are barriers with providing mental healthcare to vulnerable populations. These barriers, which are applicable throughout the United States, serve as a rationale for the need of innovative solutions for the integration of these services in not only emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in daily non-emergent operations to sufficiently address the needs for those needing mental healthcare.","output":"Challenges faced by mental health providers and patients during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic due to technological barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Investors around the globe are increasingly focusing on investing in a responsible manner by accounting for environmental, social and corporate governance aspects alongside financial performance Shareholder activism is a prevalent responsible investment strategy that is gradually gaining traction among South African investors Aim: The primary objective was to gauge the views of selected local institutional investors on the nature of shareholder activism endeavours in South Africa The secondary objective was to offer suggestions on the way forward for shareholder activism considering rapid technological development and the COVID-19 pandemic Setting: South Africa offers a well-developed framework for responsible investors Given their substantial shareholding, institutional investors in particular have considerable power to influence the practices and policies of investee companies Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 representatives of local institutional investor organisations Thematic analysis was conducted to analyse the primary data Results: Interviewees mostly engaged in private with investee companies on corporate governance issues They explained that more information is required to meaningfully engage on social and environmental considerations Participants indicated that they consider and employ public activism mechanisms if private engagements are deemed unsuccessful Conclusion: Technology will play an increasingly important role to enhance shareholder activism in future, but also offers various challenges Although social media might be a valuable avenue to disclose information, it should be cautiously managed Selective engagement details could be published on institutional investors and companies websites to enhance transparency regarding the nature and outcomes of engagements Virtual and hybrid annual general meetings are likely to enable more shareholders to become active owners in future ? 2021 The Authors Licensee: AOSIS","output":"Reflecting on the changing landscape of shareholder activism in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, little is known regarding the transmission risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection for subjects involved in handling, transporting, and examining deceased persons with known or suspected COVID-19 positivity at the time of death. This experimental study aims to define if and/or how long SARS-CoV-2 persists with replication capacity in the tissues of individuals who died with/from COVID-19, thereby generating infectious hazards. Sixteen patients who died with/from COVID-19 who underwent autopsy between April 2020 and April 2021 were included in this study. Based on PMI, all samples were subdivided into two groups: short PMI group (eight subjects who were autopsied between 12 to 72 h after death); long PMI (eight subjects who were autopsied between 24 to 78 days after death). All patients tested positive for RT-PCR at nasopharyngeal swab both before death and on samples collected during post-mortem investigation. Moreover, a lung specimen was collected and frozen at ?80 C in order to perform viral culture. The result was defined based on the cytopathic effect (subjective reading) combined with the positivity of the RT-PCR test (objective reading) in the supernatant. Only in one sample (PMI 12 h), virus vitality was demonstrated. This study, supported by a literature review, suggests that the risk of cadaveric infection in cases of a person who died from/with COVID-19 is extremely low in the first hours after death, becoming null after 12 h after death, confirming the World Health Organization (WHO) assumed in March 2020 and suggesting that the corpse of a subject who died from/with COVID-19 should be generally considered not infectious.","output":"Do We Really Need Hazard Prevention at the Expense of Safeguarding Death Dignity in COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Respiratory disease vaccines may affect COVID-19 associated infection and mortality rates due to vaccine non-specific effects against viral infections.

RESULTS: The study found that countries with universal BCG (bacillus Calmette Gurin) vaccine had a significantly lower total infection and mortality rates, 0.2979 and 0.0077 vs. 3.7445, and 0.0957/1000 people and confirmed cases (P<0.001). The countries with universal Pneumococcal vaccine (PCV); including PCV1, PCV2, and PCV3 vaccines had significantly higher total mortality, 0.0111 vs. 0.0080, respectively (P=0.032). The higher income was associated with increasing total infection and mortality rates. Whereas, BCG vaccination was associated with a lower total mortality rate only (P=0.030).

Among the sectors that most perceive this type of violence, health care professionals stand out. The most common type of violence for this professional group is the one perpetrated by the users or patients themselves. It has been reported that one out of every four acts of violence in the workplace occurs in the healthcare setting. Within the health sector, the Mental Health, Emergency and Primary Care services have been widely reported as being among the most vulnerable, with Primary Care being the least addressed of the three. Although the available literature is extensive, there are hardly any studies that explore from a qualitative perspective what are the sources of conflict in this sector from the perspective of the users, the most common being to work with professionals. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine those aspects derived from the organization, the professionals or the users of Primary Care that, from the users' point of view, cause violent situations and how they think these could be avoided. Method: The sample consisted of 80 users of the Primary Care services of the Health Service of Murcia. For data collection, a qualitative study was conducted through 10 focus groups and a subsequent thematic analysis of the data. Results: The results have allowed us to identify that, from an organizational point of view, the uncertainty in waiting times, the need to adapt the telematic or telephone appointment to the different types of users, or the management of emergencies in Primary Care are the aspects that cause most conflicts between users and professionals. In this sense, suggested improvements are aimed at providing information in the mobile application updated on the opening hours or maintaining the telephone appointment for those who need or request it, among many others. As for the professionals, users point out that the medical staff is perceived as distant and sometimes does not provide enough information on the health status of users. Another professional group widely addressed in the focus groups was the administrative staff, being described as lacking in communication skills, assertiveness, or empathy. Users recognize the existence of a demanding/aggressive profile among users, who makes instrumental use of violence to achieve privileges over users in general. We have also identified the profile of the user who makes use of Primary Care as a way of socializing or managing conflicts of a socioemotional nature. As proposals for this thematic block, users suggest group therapies, the use of audiovisual material complementary to the information provided by professionals or community interventions in psychoeducation. Conclusion: This study allows to explore conflicts between users and professionals from the Primary Care patients' perspective. Our results are complementary to the available evidence that has used the professional's approach to study the phenomenon of workplace violence. The identification of sources of conflict and the assessment and contribution of users on possible ways of improvement can serve as a basis for the design of prevention and intervention plans to improve the work environment in Primary Care centers.","output":"Users' Perception of Violence and Conflicts With Professionals in Primary Care Centers Before and During COVID-19.

MethodsWe used anonymised public health record data linked to infection data (PCR) using the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action resource. We then constructed an SIR epidemic model to explain SARS-CoV-2 infection data across the Cheshire and Merseyside region of the UK. ResultsWe determined that the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in reducing susceptibility to infection is 39% (95% credible interval [34,43]) and 64% (95% credible interval [61,67]) for a single dose and a double dose respectively.

The initial response can be crucial to outcomes, all the while recognising that changes may be needed as the emergency progresses. The recent coronavirus pandemic demonstrated how the course of action taken by authorities endorsing these protective behaviours early on can save thousands of lives. Factors that determine response success include public compliance with authorities' recommendations and cooperation between experts and rescuers. In particular, the way rescuers perceive the risks of ionising radiation hazards will influence their preparedness to respond in case of a radiological or nuclear emergency. Having found no previous studies on radiological hazard and risk perception amongst rescuers in Portugal, mental models were used as a descriptive approach. The target groups were firefighters and the military formally trained to deal with radiation hazard emergencies. Their representations of radiological hazards and risks were analysed in the light of an expert model built ad hoc. The results show several overlays between experts and rescuers on the understanding of radiation hazards and potential risks. We conclude that the main gap between radiation risk perceptions by rescuers and experts involves the concepts and mechanisms of radiation contamination and its spread among individuals, in particular, if persons exposed to radioactive sources may also become a radioactive source themselves. This gap can have practical implications for an emergency response.","output":"Ionising radiation risk perception through mental models: towards radiological emergency preparedness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Sperm cryopreservation is fundamental in the management of patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatments. Concerns have risen in relation to SARS-CoV-2 and its potential for testicular involvement, since SARS-CoV-2-positive cryopreserved samples may have unknown effects on fertilization and embryo safety. This study therefore aimed to analyze the safety of sperm cryopreservation for cancer patients after the onset of the pandemic in Italy, through assessment of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and viral RNA testing of semen samples. METHODS: We recruited 10 cancer patients (mean age 30.5  9.6 years) referred to our Sperm Bank during the Italian lockdown (from March 11th to May 4th 2020) who had not undergone a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients were administered a questionnaire on their exposure to COVID-19, and semen samples were taken. Before cryopreservation, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from a 150 l aliquot of seminal fluid in toto using QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) and amplified by a real time RT PCR system (RealStar SARS-CoV2 RT PCR, Altona Diagnostics) targeting the E and S genes. RESULTS: The questionnaire and medical interview revealed that all patients were asymptomatic and had had no previous contact with COVID-19 infected patients. All semen samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. CONCLUSION: This preliminary assessment suggests that a thorough evaluation (especially in the setting of a multidisciplinary team) and molecular confirmation of the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in seminal fluid from asymptomatic cancer patients may assist in ensuring the safety of sperm cryopreservation.","output":"Sperm cryopreservation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the necessity and urgency of detecting infectious disease marker procalcitonin (PCT), a novel unlabeled photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor was prepared for the rapid and sensitive detection of PCT. Firstly, SnO(2) porous nanoflowers with good photocatalytic performance were prepared by combining hydrothermal synthesis and calcining. BiOI nanoflowers were synthesized by facile ultrasonic mixed reaction. Ag(2)S quantum dots were deposited on SnO(2)/BiOI composites by in situ growth method. The SnO(2)/BiOI/Ag(2)S composites with excellent photoelectric properties were employed as substrate material, which could provide significantly enhanced and stable signal because of the energy level matching of SnO(2), BiOI and Ag(2)S and the good light absorption performance. Accordingly, a PEC immunosensor based on SnO(2)/BiOI/Ag(2)S was constructed by using the layered modification method to achieve high sensitivity analysis of PCT. The linear dynamic range of the detection method was 0.50 pgmL(?1)~100 ngmL(?1), and the detection limit was 0.14 pgmL(?1). In addition, the designed PEC immunosensor exhibited satisfactory sensitivity, selectivity, stability and repeatability, which opened up a new avenue for the analyzation of PCT and further provided guidance for antibiotic therapy.","output":"Ultrasensitive Photochemical Immunosensor Based on Flowerlike SnO(2)/BiOI/Ag(2)S Composites for Detection of Procalcitonin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter provides an overview of the human and animal viruses.

The objective of this study was to survey the use of smartphone-based medical apps among dentists in China and determine dentists' perceptions of such apps. METHODS: All data were collected using anonymous questionnaires. The questionnaires for this cross-sectional study were randomly sent to dentists by email, and 379 dentists responded. Dentists' demographics and perceptions of WeChat, QQ (the most popular social media apps in China) and other medical apps were assessed; the questionnaire including questions on the purpose, frequency, daily use, and opinion of the apps they used. Questions were answered using a Likert scale (1 = strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = not sure, 4 = disagree, and 5 = strongly disagree). RESULTS: A total of 379 valid responses were received; the respondents had a median age of 33.6 years old (63.3% female). All subjects (100%) owned a smartphone, and all of them installed and used WeChat or QQ in their clinical practice. Only 76% of subjects installed medical apps (other than WeChat and QQ) on their smartphones. Male dentists were more likely to install medical apps than female dentists (p < 0.05). With increasing age, the percentage of dentists who installed medical apps decreased (p < 0.001). The frequency and daily use were higher for WeChat and QQ than for medical apps. Medical apps were positively perceived, with dentists reporting that they recommend these medical apps to their peers (Likert score: 1.67  0.68).

Little is known on the consequences of SARS-COV-2 on cognitive functions of patients in the sub-acute phase of the disease. We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on cognitive functions of patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). Material and Methods: 87 patients admitted to the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit from March 27th to June 20th 2020 were included. Patients underwent Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Data were divided in 4 groups according to the respiratory assistance in the acute phase: Group1 (orotracheal intubation), Group2 (non-invasive ventilation using Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure), Group3 (Venturi Masks), Group4 (no oxygen therapy). Follow-ups were performed at one month after home-discharge. Results: Out of the 87 patients (62 Male, mean age 67.23 +/- 12.89 years), 80% had neuropsychological deficits (MoCA and MMSE) and 40% showed mild-to-moderate depression. Group1 had higher scores than Group3 for visuospatial/executive functions (p=0.016), naming (p=0.024), short- and long-term memory (p=0.010, p=0.005), abstraction (p=0.024), and orientation (p=0.034). Group1 was younger than Groups2 and 3. Cognitive impairments correlated with patients' age. Only 18 patients presented with anosmia. Their data did not differ from the other patients. FIM (<100) did not differ between groups. Patients partly recovered at one-month follow-up and 43% showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusion: Patients with severe functional impairments had important cognitive and emotional deficits which might have been influenced by the choice of ventilatory therapy, but mostly appeared to be related to aging, independently of FIM scores.

RESULTS: A total of 449 patients were included, of which 55.2% were males and 73.3% (328) were aged >18 years. The mean age was 42 years with a range of 3 months to 83 years. Forty-seven percent (213) reported at least one symptom. Common symptoms were fever (32.3%, 145), headache (31.6%, 142), and cough (30.1%, 135), respectively. Males were 64% less likely to be symptomatic than females [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.183C0.917]. Farmers (aHR = 3.17, 95% CI 1.119C8.953), and drivers and loaders (aHR = 3.18, 95% CI 1.029C9.834) were 3 times more likely to be symptomatic compared to housewives. Residents of Samtse sub-districts were 5 times more likely to be symptomatic than those living in other sub-districts (aHR = 5.16, 95% CI 2.362C11.254). CONCLUSION: The risk of developing COVID-19 symptoms was being fe male, farmers, drivers and loaders, and residents of the Samtse sub-district.

METHODS: A total of 77 young adults with confirmed severe COVID-19 were recruited retrospectively at Tongji Hospital. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records. The prognostic effects of variables were analyzed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: In this retrospective cohort, non-survivors showed higher incidence of dyspnea and co-existing laboratory abnormalities, compared with young survivals in severe COVID-19. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that lymphopenia, elevated level of d-dimer, hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-CTnI) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were independent predictors of mortality in young adults with severe COVID-19. Further analysis showed that severely young adults with two or more factors abnormalities above would be more prone to death. The similar predictive effect of above four factors had been observed in all-age patients with severe COVID-19.

We aim to elucidate the nature, regulation and functional relevance of PD-L1+ host cells in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DESIGN A total of untreated 184 HCC patients was enrolled randomly. C57BL/6 mice are given injection of Hepa1-6 cells to form autologous hepatoma. ELISpot, flow cytometry and real-time PCR are applied to analyse the phenotypic characteristics of PD-L1+ cells isolated directly from HCC specimens paired with blood samples or generated from ex vivo and in vitro culture systems. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry are performed to detect the presence of immune cells on paraffin-embedded and formalin-fixed samples. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of metabolic switching are assessed by both in vitro and in vivo studies. RESULTS We demonstrate that PD-L1+ host macrophages, which constructively represent the major cellular source of PD-L1 in HCC tumours, display an HLA-DRhighCD86high glycolytic phenotype, significantly produce antitumourigenic IL-12p70 and are polarised by intrinsic glycolytic metabolism. Mechanistically, a key glycolytic enzyme PKM2 triggered by hepatoma cell derived fibronectin 1, via a HIF-1-dependent manner, concurrently controls the antitumourigenic properties and inflammation-mediated PD-L1 expression in glycolytic macrophages. Importantly, although increased PKM2+ glycolytic macrophages predict poor prognosis of patients, blocking PD-L1 on these cells eliminates PD-L1-dominant immunosuppression and liberates intrinsic antitumourigenic properties. CONCLUSIONS Selectively modulating the 'context' of glycolytic macrophages in HCC tumours might restore their antitumourigenic properties and provide a precise strategy for anticancer therapy.","output":"PD-L1 blockade liberates intrinsic antitumourigenic properties of glycolytic macrophages in hepatocellular carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused global pandemic.

This study was designed to identify the effects of listening to music during the work break compared to the routine break (in the absence of listening to music) on the level of state anxiety and on the vital parameters of the nurses on duty at the operations center. METHODS: Randomized, controlled, three-arm, double-blind, single-center clinical study. Healthcare providers were divided into three groups according to study intervention (Group 1: listening to 440Hz music; Group 2: listening to 432Hz music; Group 3: liberal activity). The study was conducted during the working hours of dayshifts in an emergency first response unit station located in Tuscany, Italy. Outcomes were measured against measures of stress (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAIX1), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), pain and productivity (Likert Scale) measured at baseline (T0) and at the end of exposure (T1). RESULTS: Overall, 54 healthcare providers were enrolled; 32 females (59.3%); mean age of 39.64 years (SD9.94); the total measurements performed were 83. The median values of STAI X1 decreased in all the 3 groups from T0 to T1 (Group 1: 34.5 vs. 32, p=0.0001; Group 2: 34 vs. 29, p=0.001; Group 3: 33 vs. 31, p=0.028).

However, ultrasound adds complexity to care and results may be inconclusive, delaying abortion. We sought to determine the rate of ectopic pregnancy and the utility of routine ultrasound in its detection, in a community abortion service. METHODS: Retrospective case record review of women requesting abortion over a 5-year period (2015C2019) with an outcome of ectopic pregnancy or pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) at a service (Edinburgh, UK) conducting routine ultrasound on all women. Records were searched for symptoms at presentation, development of symptoms during clinical care, significant risk factors and routine ultrasound findings. RESULTS: Only 29/11 381 women (0.25%, 95% CI 0.18%, 0.33%) had an ectopic pregnancy or PUL (tubal=18, caesarean scar=1, heterotopic=1, PUL=9). Eleven (38%) cases had either symptoms at presentation (n=8) and/or significant risk factors for ectopic pregnancy (n=4). A further 12 women developed symptoms during their clinical care. Of the remaining six, three were PUL treated with methotrexate and three were ectopic (salpingectomy=2, methotrexate=1). In three cases, the baseline ultrasound indicated a probable early intrauterine pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Ectopic pregnancies are uncommon among women presenting for abortion. The value of routine ultrasound in excluding ectopic pregnancy in symptom-free women without significant risk factors is questionable as it may aid detection of some cases but may provide false reassurance that a pregnancy is intrauterine.","output":"Utility of a routine ultrasound for detection of ectopic pregnancies among women requesting abortion: a retrospective review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Open muscle biopsies in children are generally performed under general anesthesia. Alternatively, deep sedation and analgesia may be required. OBJECTIVES The aim of our study was to compare the Bispectral Index (BIS) and Comfort Score (CS) with respect to their clinical significance for sedation/analgesia in children undergoing open muscle biopsy. METHODS Thirty pediatric patients subjected to open muscle biopsy for diagnosis of their underlying disease were prospectively enrolled. Sedation/analgesia was performed in all patients using remifentanil and propofol. The patients were simultaneously monitored using the CS and BIS. RESULTS All sedations and muscle biopsies were performed uneventfully. The CS and BIS were significantly correlated (R = 0.589; P < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.918 with a maximum cut-off point of BIS 70.5 (sensitivity 0.9; specificity 0.785) for adequate sedation. Sensitivity of 100% was achieved at BIS 60. Accordingly, all patients with BIS 60 had CS within the target range of 10-14. The BIS showed substantial intra- and interindividual variability (30 points and 58 points, respectively) during sedation, whereas CS varied only within close ranges during sedation. In 25 patients, sedatives were reduced according to low BIS values (<60). No unintended anesthesia awareness was noted during the study period. CONCLUSION Bispectral Index provides an additional helpful tool to guide sedation/analgesia in minor surgical procedures in children. BIS values 60 correlated with sufficient depth of sedation and prevented unintended awareness. Additionally, BIS measurement allowed for distinct regulation of depth of sedation without prolonged sedation/analgesia due to unintended overdose.","output":"Sedation monitoring during open muscle biopsy in children by Comfort Score and Bispectral Index - a prospective analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lichtheimia species are emerging opportunistic fungal pathogens in the Mucorales, causing serious skin and respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Established agents are Lichtheimia corymbifera and L. ramosa, while L. ornata is a novel agent. Available data on a species-specific analysis of Lichtheimia infections are limited. METHODS: The first case of a fatal rhino-orbital-cerebral infection in a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipient caused by L. ornata is reported; the agent was identified by sequencing the ITS ribosomal region. We reviewed the literature on mucormycosis due to Lichtheimia species between 2009 and 2018, with an analysis of risk factors and epidemiological and clinical data. RESULTS: In addition to our Lichtheimia ornata case, 44 cases of human Lichtheimia were analyzed. Lichtheimia predominated in Europe (68.2%), followed by Asia (16%), and Africa (9%). The most common underlying condition was hematological malignancy (36.3%), followed by trauma/major surgery (27.3%), while diabetes mellitus was rare (11.4%). Site of infection was mostly skin and soft tissues (45.5%) and lung (25%), while relatively few cases were disseminated (13.6%) or rhinocerebral (11.4%). Mortality (36.4%) was mainly due to disseminated and rhinocerebral infections. CONCLUSION: In contrast to Rhizopus, the most common agent of mucormycosis recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus, Lichtheimia infections were primarily associated with hematological malignancies and major skin barrier damage. Given the fact that classical rhinocerebral mucormycosis remains difficult to treat, independent of causative species, timely application of amphotericin B accessory to debridement may be required for patient survival.","output":"First Case of Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis Caused by Lichtheimia ornata, with a Review of Lichtheimia Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by 2019-nCoV outbreaks in most of the countries has spread rapidly and became a major concern Due to the strong infectivity nature of COVID-19 and lack of experience among forensic experts in performing autopsy during this period, it has been a challenge and a learning experience for the future In this article, we summarize what are the issues faced and managed during and after medico-legal autopsy of confirmed or suspected cases ? 2020, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications All rights reserved","output":"Challenges in medico-legal autopsy during COVID-19 pandemic times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health crisis that has affected economies and societies worldwide.

However, modest data is available to describe the outcomes of patients who were hospitalized despite treatment. This study describes real-world outcomes concerning the treatment of COVID-19 with the first approved monoclonal antibody for COVID-19, bamlanivimab, as well as hospital courses associated with patients admitting after receiving the therapy. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study evaluated real-world data of patients treated with bamlanivimab. The primary endpoint was a composite of emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalization due to worsening COVID-19. Data was analyzed from November 23, 2020 to March 5, 2021. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include reported symptoms 24-hours post-infusion and time to symptom resolution in days. Additionally, clinical course of patients hospitalized were analyzed and include average oxygen requirements, median length of stay, and mortality. A subgroup analysis was conducted between patients less than sixty-five years of age and those sixty-five and older. RESULTS: 619 patients received bamlanivimab during the specified timeframe. The primary endpoint occurred in 34 patients; 11 ED visits and 23 hospitalizations. Baseline characteristics of the patients hospitalized include median age 69 years (IQR 55, 74), 56.5% male, and 82.6% Caucasian. The most common risk factors for severe disease among those hospitalized were age  65 years and history of diabetes. The clinical course of hospitalized patients varied but 52.9% required nasal cannula for respiratory support and the average length of stay was 4.5 + 4.5 days. Other COVID-19 therapies included dexamethasone in 76.5% of patients and remdesivir in 47.1% of patients. There were no major differences in the subgroup analysis.

In some individuals, feeling distressed by information may lead to avoidance of information, which has been shown to undermine compliance with preventive health behaviors in many health domains (e.g., cancer screenings). We set out to examine whether feeling distressed by information predicts higher avoidance of information about COVID-19 (avoidance hypothesis), and whether this, in turn, predicts worse compliance with measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (compliance hypothesis). Thus, we conducted an online survey with a convenience sample (N = 1,059, 79.4% female) and assessed distress by information, information avoidance, and compliance with preventive measures. Furthermore, we inquired about participants' information seeking behavior and media usage, their trust in information sources, and level of eHealth literacy, as well as generalized anxiety. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to predict distress by information, information avoidance, and compliance with preventive measures. Overall, distress by information was associated with better compliance. However, distress was also linked with an increased tendency to avoid information (avoidance hypothesis), and this reduced compliance with preventive measures (compliance hypothesis). Thus, distress may generally induce adaptive behavior in support of crisis management, unless individuals respond to it by avoiding information. These findings provide insights into the consequences of distress by information and avoidance of information during a global health crisis. These results underscore that avoiding information is a maladaptive response to distress by information, which may ultimately interfere with effective crisis management. Consequently, we emphasize the need to develop measures to counteract information avoidance.","output":"Dealing With the COVID-19 Infodemic: Distress by Information, Information Avoidance, and Compliance With Preventive Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urban parks are important urban public spaces that guarantee people recreation, create positive emotions and relieve stress.

In line with the World Health Organizations End TB Strategy, the National TB Programme promotes active case-finding (ACF) as one strategy to find people with TB who are unreached by existing health services. The IMPACT TB (Implementing proven community-based active TB case-finding intervention) project was implemented in four districts in Nepal, generating a substantial yield of previously undetected TB. We aimed to identify the facilitators and barriers linked to the implementation of ACF within IMPACT TB, as well as how those facilitators and barriers have been or could be addressed. METHODS: This was an exploratory qualitative study based on 17 semi-structured key-informant interviews with people with TB who were identified through ACF, and community health workers who had implemented ACF. Thematic analysis was applied in NVivo 11, using an implementation science framework developed by Grol and Wensing to classify the data. RESULTS: We generated five main themes from the data: (1) ACF addressed the social determinants of TB by providing timely access to free healthcare, (2) knowledge and awareness about TB among people with TB, communities and community health workers were the oil in the ACF machine, (3) trust in community health workers was fundamental for implementing ACF, (4) community engagement and support had a powerful influence on ACF implementation and (5) improved working conditions and enhanced collaboration with key stakeholders could further facilitate ACF. These themes covered a variety of facilitators and barriers, which we divided into 22 categories cutting across five framework levels: innovation, individual professional, patient, social context and organizational context. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into facilitators and barriers for the implementation of ACF in Nepal and emphasizes the importance of addressing the social determinants of TB. The main themes reflect key ingredients which are required for successful ACF implementation, while the absence of these factors may convert them from facilitators into barriers for ACF. As this study outlined how-to strategies for ACF implementation, the findings can furthermore inform the planning and implementation of ACF in Nepal and similar contexts in low- and middle-income countries.

We consider a maximization problem where the cost functional has two terms: one is the number of susceptible individuals in the long-term and the other depends on the cost of interventions. When the intervention term is linear with respect to the control, we obtain that the optimal solution is bang-bang, and we characterize the times to begin and end the strict quarantine. In the general case, when the cost functional includes the term that measures the intervention cost, we analyze the optimality of controls through numerical computations.","output":"Optimal control for a SIR epidemic model with limited quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Results of a two-question survey of nurses at one hospital identified 5 clear themes related to nurses' experiences during the pandemic and 7 areas for improvement, providing potential strategies for nurse leaders.","output":"Nurse experience during the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for nurse leaders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The consultation skill of eliciting a patient's ideas, concerns and expectations has been around in medicine since 1984.

RESULTS: 517 responses were at least 50% complete and included in the analysis. Among these, 88% (457/517) indicated vaccine acceptance. Factors associated with acceptance included not reporting any vaccine concerns, identifying as male,  65 years of age, being a physician or advanced practice provider, and interacting directly with patients from refugee, immigrant, and migrant (RIM) communities. Participants identified educational information as most helpful for themselves when making a vaccine decision, but a healthcare providers recommendation as most helpful for their patients. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers, especially those serving RIM communities, are vaccine accepting.

Limited data suggest that TCM occurring in orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients is associated with elevated peri-operative risk. AIM: To characterize the predictors of TCM in OLT recipients, using a large, multi-center pooled electronic health database. METHODS: A multi-institutional database (Explorys Inc, Cleveland, OH, USA), an aggregate of de-identified electronic health record data from 26 United States healthcare systems was surveyed. A cohort of patients with a Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms of liver transplant between 09/2015 and 09/2020 was identified. Subsequently, individuals who developed a new diagnosis of TCM following OLT were identified. Furthermore, the risk associations with TCM among this patient population were characterized using linear regression. RESULTS: Between 09/2015 and 09/2020, of 37718540 patients in the database, 38740 (0.10%) had a history of OLT (60.6% had an age between 18-65 years, 58.1% female). A new diagnosis of TCM was identified in 0.3% of OLT recipients (45.5% had an age between 18-65 years, 72.7% female), compared to 0.04% in non-OLT patients [odds ratio (OR): 7.98, 95% confidence intervals: 6.62-9.63, (P < 0.0001)]. OLT recipients who developed TCM, compared to those who did not, were more likely to be greater than 65 years of age, Caucasian, and female (P < 0.05). There was also a significant association with cardiac arrhythmias, especially ventricular arrhythmias (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: TCM was significantly more likely to occur in LT recipients vs non-recipients. Older age, Caucasian ethnicity, female gender, and presence of arrhythmias were significantly associated with TCM in LT recipients.","output":"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in orthotopic liver transplant recipients: A cohort study using multi-center pooled electronic health record data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The tourism industry needs to identify potential tourists' planned behavior after COVID-19 and prepare accordingly.

Palbociclib and ribociclib are weak bases so their solubility depends on different pH. The solubility of palbociclib dramatically decreases to < 0.5 mg/ml when pH is above 4,5 but ribociclibs solubility decreases when pH increases above 6,5. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effects of concurrent PPIs on palbociclib and ribociclib efficacy in terms of progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative mBC patients treated with endocrine treatment (letrozole or fulvestrant) combined palbociclib or ribociclib alone or with PPI accompanying our observational study. During palbociclib/ribociclib therapy, patients should be treated with \\"concurrent PPIs\\" defined as all or more than half of treatment with palbociclib/ribociclib, If no PPI was applied, it was defined as no concurrent PPI, those who used PPI but less than half were excluded from the study. All data was collected from real-life retrospectively. RESULTS: Our study included 217 patients, 105 of whom received palbociclib and 112 received ribociclib treatment. In the study population CDK inhibitor treatment was added to fulvestrant 102 patients ( 47%), to letrozole 115 patients (53%). In the Palbociclib arm fulvestrant/letrozole ratio was 53.3/46.7%, in the ribociclib arm it was 41.07/58.93%. Of 105 patients who received palbociclib, 65 were on concomitant PPI therapy, 40 were not. Of the 112 patients who received ribociclib, 61 were on concomitant PPI therapy, 51 were not. In the palbociclib group, the PFS of the patients using PPIs was shorter than the PFS of the patients not using (13.04 months vs. unreachable, p < 0.001). It was determined that taking PPIs was an independent predictor of shortening PFS (p < 0.001) in the multivariate analysis, In the ribociclib group, the PFS of the patients using PPIs was shorter than the PFS of the patients not using (12.64 months vs. unreachable, p = 0.003). It was determined that taking PPIs was single statistically independent predictor of shortening PFS (p = 0.003, univariate analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that concomitant usage of PPIs was associated with shorter PFS in mBC treated with both ribociclib and especially palbociclib. If it needs to be used, PPI selection should be made carefully and low-strength PPI or other ARAs (eg H2 antagonists, antacids) should be preferred.

For the independent effects of emotions, fear and sadness were associated with digital HISB;fear, joy, and disgust were associated with high-informational SMU;and joy and disgust were associated with low-informational SMU. Three interactive effects of discrete negative emotions suggest that an increase in one emotion can amplify the effect of another emotion on a measure of digital and social media use. In the fourth interaction of two negative emotions with strong biological regulatory processes, there is evidence that an increase in one emotion can diminish the effect of another emotion.

We thoroughly studied the differences between the two RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 when they bind with ACE2 through molecular dynamics simulations. The peculiarities of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are obvious in several aspects such as fluctuation of the binding interface, distribution of binding free energy on residues of the receptor-binding motifs, and the dissociation process. Based on these peculiarities of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by simulations, we proposed a strategy of destroying the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 by employing enzymatic digestion.

The early detection of infected patients is effective in fighting COVID19. Using radiology (X-Ray) images is, perhaps, the fastest way to diagnose the patients. Thereby, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be considered as applicable tools to diagnose COVID19 positive cases. Due to the complicated architecture of a deep CNN, its real-time training and testing become a challenging problem. This paper proposes using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) instead of the last fully connected layer to address this deficiency. However, the parameters' stochastic tuning of ELM's supervised section causes the final model unreliability. Therefore, to cope with this problem and maintain network reliability, the sine-cosine algorithm was utilized to tune the ELM's parameters. The designed network is then benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, and the results are verified by a comparative study with canonical deep CNN, ELM optimized by cuckoo search, ELM optimized by genetic algorithm, and ELM optimized by whale optimization algorithm. The proposed approach outperforms comparative benchmarks with a final accuracy of 98.83% on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 2.33% compared to a canonical deep CNN.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically review reported pharmacokinetic DDIs resulting in clinical adverse events through documented observational evidence to better inform clinicians in clinical practice. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Ovid HealthStar was conducted through March 10th, 2020. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from eligible articles according to pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles reporting bleeding or thrombotic outcomes in non-controlled (observational) settings resulting from suggested pharmacokinetic DOAC DDIs were included. RESULTS: A total of 5567 citations were reviewed, of which 24 were included following data extraction. The majority were case reports (n = 21) documenting a single adverse event resulting from a suspected DOAC DDI, while the remaining papers were a case series (n = 1) and cohort studies (n = 2). The most commonly reported interacting drugs were amiodarone and ritonavir (bleeding), and phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine (thrombosis). Bleeding events more often resulted from a combined mechanism (P-glycoprotein AND CYP3A4 inhibition), whereas thrombotic events resulted from either combined OR single P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 induction.

Infected and vaccinated individuals generate antibodies against spike, which can neutralize the virus. Most antibodies target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1; however, antibodies against other regions of spike have also been isolated. The interhost variability in domain specificity and relative neutralization efficacy of the antibodies is still poorly characterized. To this end, we tested serum and plasma samples collected from 85 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent subjects. Samples were analyzed using seven immunoassays that employ different domains, subunits, and oligomeric forms of spike to capture the antibodies. Samples were also tested for their neutralization of pseudovirus containing SARS-CoV-2 spike and of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2. While the total amount of anti-spike antibodies produced varied among convalescent subjects, we observed an unexpectedly fixed ratio of RBD- to NTD-targeting antibodies. The relative potency of the response (defined as the measured neutralization efficacy relative to the total level of spike-targeting antibodies) also exhibited limited variation between subjects and was not associated with the overall amount of antispike antibodies produced. These studies suggest that host-to-host variation in the polyclonal response elicited against SARS-CoV-2 spike in early pandemic subjects is primarily limited to the quantity of antibodies generated rather than their domain specificity or relative neutralization potency. IMPORTANCE Infection by SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies against various domains of the spike protein, including the RBD and NTD of subunit S1 and against subunit S2. The antibody responses of different infected individuals exhibit different efficacies to inactivate (neutralize) the virus. Here, we show that the observed variation in the neutralizing activity of the antibody responses in COVID-19 convalescent subjects is caused by differences in the amounts of antibodies rather than their recognition properties or the potency of their antiviral activity. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccine strategies that focus on enhancing the overall level of the antibodies will likely elicit a more uniformly efficacious protective response.","output":"Limited Variation between SARS-CoV-2-Infected Individuals in Domain Specificity and Relative Potency of the Antibody Response against the Spike Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Schools' closure during covid-19 pandemic implemented almost all over the world, together with social distances measures and lockdown to reduce transmission, could have had negative impact on youths' health.

METHODS Authors of the original review searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS Forty-two studies reporting the impact on physical health have been finally included. They have been conducted in 14 countries, most of which in Italy (30.9%) and UK (30.9%). The majority were cohort studies (40.5%) and the overall methodological quality, irrespective of study designs, was high for the 71.4% of the studies. Twenty-seven studies assessed the impact on health services utilization, whose results showed a relevant reduction of Emergency Departments accesses (64%-89.3%) and hospital admissions (31%-85%); however, an increase of acute cases was observed together with delayed admission. An important reduction of vaccine services utilization was also noted during the first period of lockdown. Domestic accidents and head trauma for suspected domestic violence increased. Health related behaviours worsened, with a relevant increase of screen time (mean of 2.9 hours to 5.1 hours), an important reduction of physical activity (up to 64%). Finally, sleep problems and increase of food consumption, particularly the unhealthy food were reported.

Validation of the tools involved adult patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 and symptoms extending over three weeks after onset. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relations of the ST and IT scores with health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), function (PCFS, post-covid functional scale), and perceived health (MYMOP2). Reliability was determined by a test-retest. The \\"patient acceptable symptomatic state\\" (PASS) was determined by the percentile method. Results Validation involved 1022 participants (55% with confirmed covid-19, 79% female and 12.5% hospitalised for covid-19). The long covid ST and IT scores were strongly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L (rs = -0.45 and rs = -0.59 respectively), the PCFS (rs = -0.39 and rs = -0.55), and the MYMOP2 (rs = -0.40 and rs = -0.59). Reproducibility was excellent with an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.86) for the ST score and 0.84 (0.80 to 0.87) for the IT score.

There could be unease for attending hospital clinics for face to face (F2F) examination. F2F benefit in cancer surveillance has to be balanced against the risk of virus transmission. This study aimed to report perceptions of fear of cancer and fear of COVID-19 and to report patient preference for follow-up consultation in HNC survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study ran from lockdown in England on 24th March to 29th July 2020. Patients were offered preference to postpone their consultation, to have it by telephone, or F2F. A postal survey was undertaken in the 2 weeks post-consultation (actual or postponed). RESULTS: There were 103 patients. Initial action by consultant and patient resulted in 51 postponed consultations, 35 telephone consultations and 17 F2F meetings, with 10 F2F triggered by the patient. There were 58 responders to the survey and most (39) had a clear preference for one mode of follow-up consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic, with half (19) preferring F2F. A similar response was seen regarding their consultations in general to address unmet needs and concerns, with 38 having a preferred mode, 29 preferring F2F. Serious fears about recurrence and COVID-19 were at relatively low levels with a tendency to be more concerned about recurrence.

Since angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-positive cells are hosts for COVID-19, we focussed on this cell type to explore the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19. In this study, we identified that ACE2-positive cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 belong to bronchial epithelial cells.

We further discovered SDCBP was positively correlated with above 12 genes particularly with HLA-DPB1 in ACE2-positive bronchial epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, SDCBP may increase the immune infiltration of B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells in different lung carcinoma. Moreover, we found the expression of SDCBP was positively correlated with the expression of antigen processing and presentation genes in post-mortem lung biopsies tissues, which is consistent with previous discoveries.

Face sensitivity represents an essential component of social competence. This ability is aberrant in most neuropsychiatric conditions. Studies in typically developing individuals enable to develop new tools for examination and better understanding non-verbal social cognition in neuropsychiatry.ObjectivesHere we used a novel set of Face-n-Thing images to address the following issues: (i) whether the ability to seeing faces in non-face images (face pareidolia) is affected by gender;and (ii) whether it is altered with changing display orientation. The main advantage of Face-n-Thing images is that face tuning occurs without being explicitly fostered by familiar elements.MethodsA newly developed Face-n-Thing task, on which images were shown either with canonical upright orientation or inverted 180o in the image plane, was administered to healthy females and males. On each trial, they have to indicate whether they have a face impression.ResultsFace impression was substantially impeded by display inversion in both males and females. With upright display orientation, no gender differences were found, whereas with inversion, Face-n-Thing images elicited face impression in females significantly more often.ConclusionsThe findings open a way for examination of face sensitivity and underwriting brain networks in neuropsychiatric conditions, most of which are gender-specific.

During the SARS-CoV2 pandemic the use of PaO2/FIO2 ratio has been increasingly used in non-invasive respiratory support such as high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The grading of hypoxemia in non-invasively ventilated patients is uncertain. The main hypothesis, investigated in this study, was that the PaO2/FIO2 ratio does not change when switching between MV, NIV and HFNC. Methods This was a sub-study of a single-center prospective observational study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden for critical COVID-19. In a steady state condition, the PaO2/FIO2 ratio was recorded before and after any change between two of the studied respiratory support techniques (i.e., HFNC, NIV and MV). Results A total of 148 patients were included in the present analysis. We find that any change in respiratory support from or to HFNC caused a significant change in PaO2/FIO2 ratio (up to 48 mmHg, from HFNC to MV). Changes in respiratory support between NIV and MV did not show consistent change in PaO2/FIO2 ratio. In patients classified as mild to moderate ARDS during MV, the change from HFNC to MV showed a variable increase in PaO2/FIO2 ratio ranging between 52 and 140 mmHg (median of 127 mm Hg). This made prediction of ARDS severity during MV from the apparent ARDS grade during HFNC impossible. Conclusion HFNC is associated with lower PaO2/FIO2 ratio than either NIV or MV in the same patient, while NIV and MV provided similar PaO2/FIO2 and thus ARDS grade by Berlin definition. The large variation of PaO2/FIO2 ratio precludes using ARDS grade as a measure of pulmonary damage during HFNC.","output":"Limitations of the ARDS criteria during high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation: Evidence from critically ill COVID-19 patients (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The WHO announced the epidemic of SARS-CoV2 as a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020. To date, it has spread to more than 200 countries and has been declared a global pandemic.

METHODOLOGY: This study aims to provide such guidance by forecasting the cumulative COVID-19 cases up to 4 weeks ahead for 187 countries, using four data-driven methodologies; autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing model (ETS), and random walk forecasts (RWF) with and without drift. For these forecasts, we evaluate the accuracy and systematic errors using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), respectively. FINDINGS: The results show that the ARIMA and ETS methods outperform the other two forecasting methods. Additionally, using these forecasts, we generate heat maps to provide a pictorial representation of the countries at risk of having an increase in the cases in the coming 4 weeks of February 2021.

The use of PPIs can result in disordered gut microbiota, leading to a risk of enteric infections. PPIs are frequently prescribed in the general practice setting for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and related conditions. Despite the availability and widespread use of probiotics and acid-suppressing medications, the effect of PPIs-induced gastric acid suppression on the survival and colonization of probiotics bacterial species is currently unclear. We hypothesized that gastric acid suppression may improve intestinal colonization of probiotics bacterial species and probiotic intervention may have a potential role in mitigating untoward effects of PPI. METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy subjects were given either proton pump inhibitor (PPI, n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) over 6 weeks. All subjects then consumed multi-strain probiotics from weeks 2-6. Thirty participants (10 males, 20 females, age range: 18-56 years) were enrolled in the study. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed on stool samples collected at week 0, 2, and 6. RESULTS Short term PPI treatment increased the microbial abundance of Streptococcaceae (p = 0.004), Leuconostacaceae (p = 0.001), and Pasteurellaceae (p = 0.020) at family level and corresponding genus levels. The metabolomic analysis of the stools revealed a change in 10 metabolites where Gly Arg Val and phenylacetic acid were consistently increased compared to the baseline. Probiotic intervention inhibited PPI-induced microbial changes such as a decrease in Leuconostacaceae family (p = 0.01) and led to an increase in metabolite 1H-Indole-4-carbaldehyde. Notably, PPI enhanced the colonization of certain probiotic bacterial species like Streptococcus thermophilus (p < 0.05) along with other species present in the multi-strain probiotic. CONCLUSION Acid suppression enhanced certain probiotic associated bacterial colonization and probiotics in turn suppressed PPI-mediated intestinal microbial alterations. Thus, probiotics in combination with PPI might be a beneficial strategy that allows probiotic colonization and suppress PPI-induced microbial perturbations. CLINICAL TRIALS.

The median doubling time and R0 were calculated for a rolling period of seven days. Interventions were scored from zero to three with an increasing level of stringency. Multivariate linear regression was performed to find the role of individual interventions on R0 and the median doubling time. Results The highest intervention score was reported in the lockdown phase, which gradually decreased to the lowest level of 22. The R0 values settled to a level of 1.25, and the median doubling time increased to 20 days at the end of the study. Public awareness and public health laws were found to be related to both R0 and the median doubling time in the pre-lockdown phase only. Conclusion The implementation of interventions at the ground level is one of the key factors in the success of public health interventions. Post implementation, poor effectiveness of many interventions is evident from the study. Further, studies related to the sequence of interventions are required to further analyze the poor effect of the interventions.","output":"Impact of Nonpharmacological Public Health Interventions on Epidemiological Parameters of COVID-19 Pandemic in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Testing is a foundational component of any COVID-19 management strategy; however, emerging evidence suggests that barriers and hesitancy to COVID-19 testing may affect uptake or participation and often these are multiple and intersecting factors that may vary across population groups. To this end, Health Canadas COVID-19 Testing and Screening Expert Advisory Panel commissioned this rapid review in January 2021 to explore the available evidence in this area. The aim of this rapid review was to identify barriers to COVID-19 testing and strategies used to mitigate these barriers. METHODS: Searches (completed January 8, 2021) were conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, medRxiv/bioRxiv, Cochrane and online grey literature sources to identify publications that described barriers and strategies related to COVID-19 testing. RESULTS: From 1294 academic and 97 grey literature search results, 31 academic and 31 grey literature sources were included. Data were extracted from the relevant papers. The most cited barriers were cost of testing; low health literacy; low trust in the healthcare system; availability and accessibility of testing sites; and stigma and consequences of testing positive. Strategies to mitigate barriers to COVID-19 testing included: free testing; promoting awareness of importance to testing; presenting various testing options and types of testing centres (i.e., drive-thru, walk-up, home testing); providing transportation to testing centres; and offering support for self-isolation (e.g., salary support or housing). CONCLUSION: Various barriers to COVID-19 testing and strategies for mitigating these barriers were identified. Further research to test the efficacy of these strategies is needed to better support testing for COVID-19 by addressing testing hesitancy as part of the broader COVID-19 public health response.

BACKGROUND The incidence of healthcare-associated infections has increased. Previous research focuses on epidemiology, healthcare systems, and the economic burden of outbreaks. Few published studies focus on the impact of outbreaks on nurses' work in acute care facilities. INTRODUCTION Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, combating infectious diseases has become a key issue. Hospitals have implemented measures related to healthcare-associated infections. However, nurses experience challenges in preventing, controlling, and contending with outbreaks. METHODS A retrospective exploratory case study approach was used. Data were collected over a 4-month period in 2012. The incidence rates of site-specific HAIs were analysed, and individual interviews were held with 23 bedside nurses and five nurse managers. FINDINGS Five themes emerged from the interviews: comparison of healthcare-associated infections outbreaks; the nature of nurses' work; impact of outbreaks on patient care; innovation and quality control in clinical practice; and increased and expanded IPAC measures. The incidence rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci at the study site decreased, but remained above provincial benchmarks. Nurses experienced workload challenges, time pressures and psychological effects stemming from outbreaks and developed various innovations in response. Patient care was also affected. CONCLUSION Nurses' work has been impacted by healthcare-associated infectious disease outbreaks. Nursing workloads should be quantified to facilitate the development of guidelines for optimum nurse-patient ratio during outbreaks. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND/OR HEALTH POLICY A strong evidence-based policy framework is required to address healthcare-associated infectious disease outbreaks. Infection prevention and control guidelines and procedures should be established provincially and nationally. An interdisciplinary approach is essential for the creation of comprehensive and innovative strategies. Nursing research has increased understanding of the implications of infectious diseases in hospitals. Building on the literature, findings from this study can be used to influence policies on the care of patients who have secondary infections. Nurse-driven protocols are important and can lead to the creation of best practice guidelines that can be implemented across settings.","output":"Infectious disease outbreaks and increased complexity of care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nursing has been grounded in the pursuit of health equity and social justice for over 100 years.

Throughout history, various infectious diseases presented widely spread damage to human life, economic viability and general well-being. The scale of destruction of the most recent pandemic, COVID-19, has yet to be seen. This work aims to introduce intervention methodology for the prevention of global scale spread of infectious diseases. The proposed method combines time-dependent infection spreading data with the social connectivity structure of the society. SIR model simulations provided the dynamic of contamination spread in different sets of network data. Seven centrality measures parameterized the local and global importance of each node in the underlying network. At each time step the calculated values of the correlations between node infection probability and node centrality values are analyzed. Calculations show that correlations increase at the beginning of infection spread and reaches its highest value when spreading starts to become an epidemic. The peak is at the very early stages of the spreading; and with this analysis, it is possible to predict the node infection probability from time-dependent correlations data.","output":"Time dependent correlations between the probability of a node being infected and its centrality measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Electronic drainage systems have shown superiority compared with traditional (water seal) drainage systems following lung resections, but the number of studies is limited. As part of a medico-technical evaluation, before change of practice to electronic drainage systems for routine thoracic surgery, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating chest tube duration and length of hospitalization. METHODS Patients undergoing lobectomy were included in a prospective open label RCT. A strict algorithm was designed for early chest tube removal, and this decision was delegated to staff nurses. Data were analysed by Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusting for lung function, gender, age, BMI, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) or open surgery and presence of incomplete fissure or pleural adhesions. Time was distinguished as possible (optimal) and actual time for chest tube removal, as well as length of hospitalization. RESULTS A total of 105 patients were randomized. We found no significant difference between the electronic group and traditional group in optimal chest tube duration (HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.55-1.25; P = 0.367), actual chest tube duration (HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.55-1.26; P = 0.397) or length of hospital stay (HR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.59-1.39; P = 0.651). No chest tubes had to be reinserted. Presence of pleural adhesions or an incomplete fissure was a significant predictor of chest tube duration (HR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.15-2.77; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS Electronic drainage systems did not reduce chest tube duration or length of hospitalization significantly compared with traditional water seal drainage when a strict algorithm for chest tube removal was used. This algorithm allowed delegation of chest tube removal to staff nurses, and in some patients chest tubes could be removed safely on the day of surgery.","output":"Electronic versus traditional chest tube drainage following lobectomy: a randomized trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a Lvy noise-driven susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model incorporating media coverage to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: This article aimed to describe a possible solution to address weak surveillance systems and document the outcomes of the deployment of the Auto-Visual Acute Flaccid Paralysis Detection and Reporting (AVADAR) project. METHODS: This intervention was implemented in 99 targeted high-risk districts with concerns for silent polio circulation from eight countries in Africa between August 1, 2017, and July 31, 2018. A total of 6954 persons (5390 community informants and 1564 health workers) were trained and equipped with a smartphone on which the AVADAR app was configured to allow community informants to send alerts on suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and allow health worker to use electronic checklists for investigation of such alerts. The AVADAR and Open Data Kit ONA servers were at the center of the entire process. A dashboard system and coordination teams for monitoring and supervision were put in place at all levels. RESULTS: Overall, 96.44% (24,142/25,032) of potential AFP case alerts were investigated by surveillance personnel, yielding 1414 true AFP cases. This number (n=1414) reported through AVADAR was higher than the 238 AFP cases expected during the study period in the AVADAR districts and the 491 true AFP cases reported by the traditional surveillance system. A total of 203 out of the 1414 true AFP cases reported were from special population settings, such as refugee camps and insecure areas. There was an improvement in reporting in silent health areas in all the countries using the AVADAR system. Finally, there were 23,473 reports for other diseases, such as measles, diarrhea, and cerebrospinal meningitis, using the AVADAR platform. CONCLUSIONS: This article demonstrates the added value of AVADAR to rapidly improve surveillance sensitivity. AVADAR is capable of supporting countries to improve surveillance sensitivity within a short interval before and beyond polio-free certification.","output":"Outcomes of the Deployment of the Auto-Visual Acute Flaccid Paralysis Detection and Reporting (AVADAR) System for Strengthening Polio Surveillance in Africa From 2017 to 2018: Evaluation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Summary: The onset of extreme social distancing measures is expected to have a dramatic impact on crime. Here, we examine the impact of mandated, city-wide social distancing orders aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19 on gang-related crime in Los Angeles.

If the normal guardianship of people and property is also disrupted by social distancing, then we expect gang violence to increase. Using autoregressive time series models, we show that gang-related crime remained stable and crime hot spots largely stationary following the onset of shelter in place.

These measures, along with the public concerns of getting COVID-19, led to a decline in the utilization of regular health services including immunization. Methods: we reviewed the administrative routine immunization data from 15 African countries for the period from January 2018 to June 2020 to analyze the trends in the monthly number of children vaccinated with specific antigens, and compare the changes in the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: thirteen of the 15 countries showed a decline in the monthly average number of vaccine doses provided, with 6 countries having more than 10% decline. Nine countries had a lower monthly mean of recipients of first dose measles vaccination in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter. Guinea, Nigeria, Ghana, Angola, Gabon, and South Sudan experienced a drop in the monthly number of children vaccinated for DPT3 and/or MCV1 of greater than 2 standard deviations at some point in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the mean for the months January-June of 2018 and 2019. Conclusion: countries with lower immunization coverage in the pre-COVID period experienced larger declines in the number of children vaccinated immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared.

The present study aimed to clarify whether celecoxib is able to induce tumor regression with minimal side effects. For that purpose, the regulation of celecoxib in the involution of IH was investigated in an IH model. Hemangioma-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Hem-MSCs) were isolated from proliferating specimens, and an IH model was established by injecting these cells into nude mice.

Histologic analysis and immunohistochemical staining of the tumor xenografts were performed to investigate the pathological evolution of the tumor. The results showed that celecoxib inhibited the proliferation and induced the adipogenic differentiation of Hem-MSCs in vitro. In vivo, adipocytes were only present in the celecoxib group at week 4, while a larger number of fibroblasts and collagenous fibers could be observed in the basic fibroblast growth factor group.

To better understand this development, a universal instrument for the assessment of addictive social media use is required. Against this background, we examined the psychometric properties of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) in representative population samples in nine countries (N = 9418, age range: 18 to 24 years (youngest group), 55 years and older (oldest group): China, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Furthermore, we investigated potential factors and mechanisms that could be associated with addictive social media use. Our cross-national findings show that the BSMAS is a unidimensional reliable and valid instrument. Moreover, they reveal that the negative association between positive mental health and addictive social media use is mediated by sense of control in seven of the nine countries (exception: China, Russia). Thus, it can be hypothesized that activities which increase positive mental health could indirectly contribute to the decrease of addictive social media use. We identified conscious engagement in physical activity and a regular sleep rhythm during the pandemic as such potential activities. The fostering of both by governmental programs could enhance positive mental health and reduce addictive social media use.","output":"Addictive social media use during Covid-19 outbreak: Validation of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) and investigation of protective factors in nine countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automated infection measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis based on Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is important for faster examination. We propose a novel approach, called DRR4Covid, to learn automated COVID-19 diagnosis and infection segmentation on CXRs from digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). DRR4Covid comprises of an infection-aware DRR generator, a classification and/or segmentation network, and a domain adaptation module. The infection-aware DRR generator is able to produce DRRs with adjustable strength of radiological signs of COVID-19 infection, and generate pixel-level infection annotations that match the DRRs precisely. The domain adaptation module is introduced to reduce the domain discrepancy between DRRs and CXRs by training networks on unlabeled real CXRs and labeled DRRs together.We provide a simple but effective implementation of DRR4Covid by using a domain adaptation module based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a FCN-based network with a classification header and a segmentation header. Extensive experiment results have confirmed the efficacy of our method;specifically, quantifying the performance by accuracy, AUC and F1-score, our network without using any annotations from CXRs has achieved a classification score of (0.954, 0.989, 0.953) and a segmentation score of (0.957, 0.981, 0.956) on a test set with 794 normal cases and 794 positive cases. Besides, we estimate the sensitive of X-ray images in detecting COVID-19 infection by adjusting the strength of radiological signs of COVID-19 infection in synthetic DRRs. The estimated detection limit of the proportion of infected voxels in the lungs is 19.43%, and the estimated lower bound of the contribution rate of infected voxels is 20.0% for significant radiological signs of COVID-19 infection.

Asserting the prerogatives of the executive included the radical simplification of the relationship between politics, law and science. State actors took emergency measures by recourse to a single piece of legislation-the 'infection protection law' (Infektionsschutzgesetz)-overriding other elements of the legal order. They also limited the government's use of scientific expertise to a small number of advisors, thereby cutting short debates about the appropriateness or otherwise of the government's crisis measures.

All tobacco-related illnesses including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease are known to reduce the lung capacity and impair the immune system of the body and can greatly influence the ability to fight the novel coronavirus. The purpose of this state-of-the-art literature review is to summarize the evidence of the association of tobacco use with the severity of the COVID-19 manifestations. METHOD: Articles describing the association of tobacco use with the severity of COVID-19 manifestations were searched on PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google. This review covers the relevant studies on the subject published from January 1, 2020 to September 10, 2020. RESULTS: Tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. Pre-existing comorbidities in tobacco users such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases and hypertension were found to further aggravate the disease manifestations making the treatment of such COVID-19 patients more challenging due to their rapid clinical deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Current review indicates that nicotine exposure is linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 and tobacco use can be a potential risk factor for not only getting the viral infection but also its severe manifestations. The current pandemic provides a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate national tobacco control programs to achieve a tobacco-free world.","output":"Tobacco use as a well-recognized cause of severe COVID-19 manifestations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Brazil is one of the epicenters of COVID-19 pandemic and faces several hindrances to make his COVID-19 vaccination plan efficient. METHODS The Brazilian COVID-19 vaccination plan was evaluated and the hindrances to make the COVID-19 vaccination plan efficient were described and discussed. RESULTS High territorial extension might contribute to a delay on the COVID-19 vaccination, due to difficulty in delivering vaccines to furthest Brazilian states and to all the interior cities. The choice among the vaccines should be done based on the type of storage and must consider the transport conditions necessary to maintain its effectiveness. The indigenous individuals were included with health-care workers as the first group to be vaccinated, inflaming the number of vaccines doses distributed in states where the indigenous population have higher prevalence. The antivaccine movement and the politicization of the vaccine are also hindrances to be overcome in Brazil. The COVID-19 incidence or mortality rate and the distribution of intensive care units (ICUs) are not a criterion to distribute the vaccines, as we did not identify a correlation between these markers and the number of vaccines. However, a strong or very strong correlation occurred between the number of COVID-19 vaccines and the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths by COVID-19, gross domestic product, as well as populational density. A total of 83,280,475 doses of COVID-19 vaccines were distributed in Brazil. In the first dose, the Coronavac (Sinovac?), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca/Oxford?), and BNT162b (Pfizer/BioNTech?) vaccines were responsible to vaccinate, respectively, 9.61%, 6.69%, and 0.35% of the Brazilian population. In the second dose, the Coronavac, AZD1222, and BNT162b vaccines were responsible to vaccinate, respectively, 7.52%, 0.53%, and <0.01% of the Brazilian population.

However, evidence for the role of CCE as an adjunct or alternative to CC remains equivocal. In this observational cohort study, we report our experience of using CCE to investigate patients with suspected colon pathology at a tertiary referral centre. METHODS From 2007-2015, consecutive patients requiring colonoscopy were recruited from a tertiary care centre in Malmo, Sweden. Data collected: patient demographics, indication for CCE, findings, bowel cleansing, colon transit time (CTT) and completeness of colon examination. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients (57 F/20 F, median age 56 years) were included. The reason for CCE was previously incomplete or refused CC in 39 and 26 cases, and follow up of previous findings in 12 cases, respectively. The main clinical indications were gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (n=28; 36%) and suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or follow-up of known IBD (n=23; 30%). CCE was complete in 58/77 (75%) patients. In 3 patients the colon was not reached; in the other 16, the capsule reached the rectum (n=4), sigmoid (n=6), descending colon (n=5) and transverse colon (n=1). Findings were: normal CCE (n=15; 19%) colonic diverticula (n=29; 38%), polyps (n=17; 22%), active IBD (n=12; 16%), haemorrhoids (n=8; 10%), colonic angioectasia (n=4; 5%) and cancer (n=1; 1%). Small-bowel findings were recorded in 8 (10%) patients. All patients tolerated bowel preparation and CCE well. Two patients with an ulcerated small-bowel stricture and cancer respectively experienced temporary capsule retention with spontaneous resolution.

METHODS: This case series included consecutive IBD patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Age-adjusted cumulative incidences were compared with the general population in the Madrid region. RESULTS: Through April 8, 12 of 1918 IBD patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The average age was 52 years, 75% of the patients were female and 58.3% had Crohn's disease. Seven patients (58%) were on maintenance treatment with immunomodulators/biologics, of these four with combined therapy (33%). Eight patients (66%) required hospitalisation (one intensive care unit admission, and two deaths), and four patients were isolated at home. Nine patients had diarrhoea ranging between 4 and 10 loose stools per day (mean 5.4, SD 1.6). In five patients (42%) diarrhoea was a presenting symptom. In two patients, diarrhoea was the only symptom at debut. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 6.2 per 1000 IBD patients.

In such situations, the basic needs for self-determination (SDT) are disrupted-autonomy, connectedness, and competence-but it is the resulting dissatisfaction that actualizes a search for strategies to cope with the problem. The objective of this article is to critically review the literature on various ways that people are coping with specific experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and their relationship to basic needs to maintain sustainability. We searched on the Web of Science CC database for relevant studies (2020C2021) and their systematization from the standpoint of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). This showed the dynamics of coping methods, reflecting a transition from confusion when confronted with stress, to the selection of effective strategies, confirming that when basic needs are blocked for a long time, people begin to search for a way to satisfy them. We present three levels of grouped coping methods: (1) physiological, (2) behavioral, and (3) cognitive, demonstrating their interrelationship with orientation (to oneself or to the context), assessment (a threat or a challenge), and basic psychological needs.

Quantifying these changes requires a business as usual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal variability of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO$_{2}$) and ozone (O$_{3}$) at 5,756 observation sites in 46 countries from January through June 2020. Reductions in NO$_{2}$ correlate with timing and intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60% in severely affected cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On average, NO$_{2}$ concentrations were 18% lower than business as usual from February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the business as usual estimate. NO$_{2}$ reductions in Europe and the US have been more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that the global NO$_{x}$ (NO+NO$_{2}$) emission reduction during the first 6 months of 2020 amounted to 2.9 TgN, equivalent to 5.1% of the annual anthropogenic total. The response of surface O$_{3}$ is complicated by competing influences of non-linear atmospheric chemistry. While surface O$_{3}$ increased by up to 50% in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O$_{3}$ between February - June 2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a flattening of the O$_{3}$ diurnal cycle with an increase in night time ozone due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a reduction in photochemical production. The O$_{3}$ response is dependent on season, time scale, and environment, with declines in surface O$_{3}$ forecasted if NO$_{x}$ emission reductions continue.","output":"Global Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on the Atmospheric Concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Several cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 have been described in clinical studies While those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease seem to have worse outcomes, growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 itself can cause myocardial injury, arrhythmia, and heart failure We report a case of a 27-year-old male with no known comorbidities who presented with nausea, vomiting and non-radiating substernal chest pressure without respiratory symptoms in May of 2020 Laboratory findings showed elevated cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST-segment elevation Coronary angiography revealed normal coronaries but findings suggestive of cardiogenic shock Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive He was treated for fulminant myopericarditis and cardiogenic shock with remdesivir, steroid, inotropes and vasopressors but rapidly deteriorated and went into cardiac arrest and was unable to be resuscitated despite multiple rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation Fulminant myopericarditis is a rare complication of COVID-19 with high mortality that requires early recognition, treatment and a transfer to a tertiary facility with advanced cardiac services","output":"A Case of Isolated SARS-CoV-2 Fulminant Myopericarditis Without Respiratory Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of ICU patients with COVID-19 and to investigate differences between survivors and non-survivors.

DESIGN: Multi-institutional survey regarding inpatient resuscitation practices during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. SETTING: Internet-based survey. SUBJECTS: U.S. PICU representatives (one per institution) involved in resuscitation system planning and oversight. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 130 institutions surveyed, 78 (60%) responded. Forty-eight centers (62%) had admitted coronavirus disease 2019 patients; 26 (33%) reported code team activation for patients with suspected/confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. Sixty-seven respondents (86%) implemented changes to inpatient emergency response systems. The most common changes were as follows: limited number of personnel entering patient rooms (75; 96%), limited resident involvement (71; 91%), and new or refined team roles (74; 95%). New or adapted technology is being used for coronavirus disease 2019 resuscitations in 58 centers (74%). Most institutions (57; 73%) are using enhanced personal protective equipment for all coronavirus disease 2019 resuscitation events; 18 (23%) have personal protective equipment policies dependent on the performance of aerosol generating procedures. Due to coronavirus disease 2019, most respondents are intubating earlier during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (56; 72%), utilizing video laryngoscopy (67; 86%), pausing chest compressions during laryngoscopy (56; 72%), and leaving patients connected to the ventilator during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (56; 72%).

They were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. At 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 days post-infection (dpi), these hamsters were euthanized, and tissues were collected for ultrastructural and microstructural examinations. Microscopic lesions were prominent in the upper and lower respiratory tracts from 2 and 4 dpi groups, respectively. The respiratory epithelium in the trachea, bronchiole, and alveolar showed pathological changes. Inflammatory cells including neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils were infiltrated in/around tracheal lamina propria, pulmonary vessels, alveoli, and bronchiole. In pulmonary lesions, alveolar wall was thickened with infiltrated inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils and macrophages. In the trachea, epithelial damages started from 2 dpi and recovered from 8 dpi, consistent with microscopic results, High levels of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein were detected at 2 dpi and 4 dpi. In the lung, lesions were most severe at 8 dpi. Meanwhile, high levels of SARS-CoV-2 were detected at 4 dpi. Electron microscopic examinations revealed cellular changes in the trachea epithelium and alveolar epithelium such as vacuolation, sparse micro-organelle, and poor cellular margin. In the trachea epithelium, the number of cytoplasmic organelles was diminished, and small vesicles were prominent from 2 dpi. Some of these electron-lucent vesicles were filled with virion particles. From 8 dpi, the trachea epithelium started to recover. Because of shrunken nucleus and swollen cytoplasm, the N/C ratio of type 2 pneumocyte decreased at 8 and 12 dpi. From 8 dpi, lamellar bodies on type 2 pneumocyte cytoplasm were increasingly observed. Their number then decreased from 16 dpi. However, there was no significant change in type 1 pneumocyte. Viral vesicles were only observed in the cytoplasm of type 2 pneumocyte. In conclusion, ultra- and micro-structural changes presented in this study may provide useful information for SARS-CoV-2 studies in various fields.","output":"Ultra- and micro-structural changes of respiratory tracts in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute otitis media is usually considered a simple bacterial infection that is treated with antibiotics. However, ample evidence derived from studies ranging from animal experiments to extensive clinical trials supports a crucial role for respiratory viruses in the etiology and pathogenesis of acute otitis media. Viral infection of the upper respiratory mucosa initiates the whole cascade of events that finally leads to the development of acute otitis media as a complication. The pathogenesis of acute otitis media involves a complex interplay between viruses, bacteria, and the host's inflammatory response. In a substantial number of children, viruses can be found in the middle-ear fluid either alone or together with bacteria, and recent studies indicate that at least some viruses actively invade the middle ear. Viruses appear to enhance the inflammatory process in the middle ear, and they may significantly impair the resolution of otitis media. Prevention of the predisposing viral infection by vaccination against the major viruses would probably be the most effective way to prevent acute otitis media. Alternatively, early treatment of the viral infection with specific antiviral agents would also be effective in reducing the occurrence of acute otitis media.","output":"Importance of respiratory viruses in acute otitis media."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obtaining a clear assessment of the anterior segment is critical for disease diagnosis and management in ophthalmic telemedicine.

Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of \\"immune enhancement\\"). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MCH Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the mortality, severity, clinical, and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in blood in 96 pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19. Among all patients, 6 (6%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia. Out of the six patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, four (67%) had a severe form of the disease, and two out of the 6 patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia passed away (33%). Our results show that the symptoms more commonly found in the cases of COVID-19 in the study (fever, cough, tachypnea, and vomiting), were found at a higher percentage in the patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia. Creatine phosphokinase and magnesium tests showed significant differences between the positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia groups. Among all laboratory tests, magnesium and creatine phosphokinase could better predict SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with area under the curve levels of 0.808 and 0.748, respectively.

This study investigated the seroprevalence of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella-zoster in newly employed female nurses. METHODS: We conducted a survey on the seroprevalence of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella-zoster in newly employed female nurses at a university hospital from 2011 to 2019, before the nurses were given their department placements and duty start. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent and chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies. We analyzed whether there was a significant difference in seroprevalence depending on the age, birth year, birth season, and region of residence (metropolitan residency: yes or no). RESULTS: The arithmetic mean ages of the participants were 28.6  4.8, 23.5  3.2, 23.6  3.0, and 26.1  4.5 years for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella-zoster, respectively. The seropositivity rates were 93.9% (551/587), 60.2% (50/83), 83.3% (3,093/3,711), and 89.5% (978/1,093) for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella-zoster, respectively. Significant differences in the seroprevalence when assessed according to the age and birth year were noted with measles, while significant differences in the seroprevalence were only noted with rubella and varicella-zoster when assessed according to birth year and age, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified the levels of antibody prevalence in new female nurses. Considering the seropositivity levels, cost-effectiveness, and convenience for the participants, we recommend that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination be provided without serologic testing for all new female nurses and the varicella-zoster vaccination only be performed for persons who are negative after serologic testing.

Despite this, there is limited data on their use in perioperative risk prediction. We explored whether these wearables could accurately approximate metrics (anaerobic threshold, peak oxygen uptake and peak work) derived using formalised cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients undergoing high-risk surgery. METHODS: Patients scheduled for major elective intra-abdominal surgery and undergoing CPET were included. Physical activity levels were estimated through direct measures (step count, floors climbed and total distance travelled) obtained through continuous wear of a wrist worn activity monitor (Garmin Vivosmart HR+) for 7 days prior to surgery and self-report through completion of the short International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Correlations and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis explored the relationships between parameters provided by CPET and physical activity. DEVICE SELECTION: Our choice of consumer wearable device was made to maximise feasibility outcomes for this study. The Garmin Vivosmart HR+ had the longest battery life and best waterproof characteristics of the available low-cost devices. RESULTS: Of 55 patients invited to participate, 49 (mean age 65.3  13.6 years; 32 males) were enrolled; 37 provided complete wearable data for analyses and 36 patients provided full IPAQ data. Floors climbed, total steps and total travelled as measured by the wearable device all showed moderate correlation with CPET parameters of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO(2)) (R = 0.57 (CI 0.29C0.76), R = 0.59 (CI 0.31C0.77) and R = 0.62 (CI 0.35C0.79) respectively), anaerobic threshold (R = 0.37 (CI 0.01C0.64), R = 0.39 (CI 0.04C0.66) and R = 0.42 (CI 0.07C0.68) respectively) and peak work (R = 0.56 (CI 0.27C0.75), R = 0.48 (CI 0.17C0.70) and R = 0.50 (CI 0.2C0.72) respectively). Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis for direct and self-reported measures of 7-day physical activity could accurately approximate the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (V(E)/VCO(2)) and the anaerobic threshold. The area under these curves was 0.89 for V(E)/VCO(2) and 0.91 for the anaerobic threshold. For peak VO(2) and peak work, models fitted using just the wearable data were 0.93 for peak VO(2) and 1.00 for peak work. CONCLUSIONS: Data recorded by the wearable device was able to consistently approximate CPET results, both with and without the addition of patient reported activity measures via IPAQ scores. This highlights the potential utility of wearable devices in formal assessment of physical functioning and suggests they could play a larger role in pre-operative risk assessment.

The local delivery of FPV nanoparticles (NPs) via nebulization ensures that the drug can reach the site of infection, the lungs. Solid lipid NPs of favipiravir (FPV-SLNs) were formulated utilizing the hot-evaporation method. The physicochemical formulation properties were evaluated using dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

In the present study, a binding assay was set up to follow by flow cytometry the attachment of PRRSV on the surface of porcine and non-porcine cells. PRRSV was found to be able to bind permissive cells like porcine alveolar macrophages and MARC-145. Further binding assays with porcine peripheral blood leukocytes showed that only monocytes can attach the virus. By their lack of binding factor, lymphocytes appeared to be refractory to PRRSV infection. Pre-incubation of MARC-145 cells with chymotrypsin and pronase E, but not neuraminidase, blocked their binding activity for PRRSV. The binding activity of the protease-treated cells was regenerated 8 hours after treatment, but cells remained unable to bind PRRSV if maintained in the presence of cycloheximide, thus confirming the proteinic nature of the specific binding factor(s). Experiments conduced with cells that have been previously characterized as non-permissive to PRRSV infection showed that many of them were able to bind the virus. Data obtained suggest that interaction of PRRSV with a specific binding factor on the surface of some cells is not sufficient to lead to a productive infection, and that a second putative receptor or other phenomena are probably required to pursue later events.","output":"Preliminary characterization of protein binding factor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus on the surface of permissive and non-permissive cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis revealed that business scholars are painfully and perhaps unnecessarily slow at producing academic content Rather than make excuses, let?s move towards more nimble scholarship","output":"Nimble Scholarship by Necessity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to evaluate the preparedness and adherence of community pharmacists to the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Health Advisory COVID-19 guidelines for pharmacists (July 2020) during COVID-19 pandemic.

For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downsin cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. It is crucial but hard to know how and when to take which level of interventions tailored to the specific situation in each country. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly accessing the effect of multiple interventions to control the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts in the UK and other European countries, accounting for balance of healthcare demand. Methods We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild, moderate and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with date on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London and non-London regions in the UK during February 2020 and April 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. We applied the calibrated model to the prediction of infection and healthcare resource changes in other 6 European countries based on actual measures they have implemented during this period. Findings We estimated given that 1) By the date (5th March 2020) of the first report death in the UK, around 7499 people would have already been infected with the virus. After taking suppression on 23rd March, the peak of infection in the UK would have occurred between 28th March and 4th April 2020; the peak of death would have occurred between 18th April and 24th April 2020. 2) By 29th April, no significant collapse of health system in the UK have occurred, where there have been sufficient hospital beds for severe and critical cases. But in the Europe, Italy, Spain and France have experienced a 3 weeks period of shortage of hospital beds for severe and critical cases, leading to many deaths outside hospitals. 3) One optimal strategy to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK is to take region-level specific intervention. If taking suppression with very high intensity in London from 23rd March 2020 for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in non-London regions. The total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 9.3 million and 143 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 96th day (12th May, 2020), where it needs hospital beds for 68.9 thousand severe and critical cases. 4) If taking a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 10 million and 154 thousand; the peak time of healthcare occurs at the 97th day (13th May, 2020), where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 73.5 thousand. 5) If too early releasing intervention intensity above moderate level and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, there would be a risk of second wave, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 23.4 million and 897 thousand. Interpretation: Considering social and economic costs in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, long-term suppression is not economically viable. Our finding suggests that rolling intervention is an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK and potential other countries for balancing healthcare demand and morality ratio. As for huge difference of population density and social distancing between different regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement regional level specific intervention with varied intensities and maintenance periods. We suggest an intervention strategy to the UK that take a consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would reduce the overall infections and deaths of COVID-19 outbreaks, and balance healthcare demand in the UK.","output":"The effect of multiple interventions to balance healthcare demand for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: In specialties that heavily rely on communication skills such as psychiatry, psychotherapy and psychosomatic medicine, teaching in times of the COVID-19 pandemic is especially challenging.

A data set consisting of twenty\\\\eight anatomical characters scored for twenty\\\\eight terminal taxa representing the world fauna of Signiphoridae was analysed using parsimony and compatibility methods. The Coccophaginae (Aphelinidae) and the Azotinae (Aphelinidae) were used as outgroups to establish polarity of character state changes. Relationships of Signiphoridae to other Chalcidoidea are discussed. Several multistate characters were treated in the parsimony analyses either as unordered or as ordered into transformation series using additive binary coding, which in some cases drastically reduced the number of equally parsimonious solutions. Monophyly of Signiphoridae is supported by seven synapomorphies. Four genera, Chartocerus, Thysanus, Clytina and Signiphora, are recognized within Signiphoridae based on synapomorphies. Rozanoviella syn.n. and Kerrichiella syn.n. are synonymized under Signiphora. Species of Signiphora are further assigned to four species groups, three of which are demonstrably monophyletic. Nine species or subspecies are transferred to Chartocerus from Signiphora (australicus comb.n., australiensis comb.n., australiensis orbiculatus comb.n., beethoveni comb.n., corvinus comb.n., funeralis comb.n., reticulata comb.n., ruskini comb.n., thusanoides comb.n.), one species to Thysanus from Signiphora (melancholicus comb.n.), and one species to Signiphora from Kerrichiella (coleoptratus comb.n.).

Using an appropriate bioinformatics pipeline, we could identify mutations in the nucleocapsid (N) gene, which have been reported previously in studies conducted in other countries. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the technique used in this study has not been used for SARS-CoV-2 detection previously owing to the difficulties in the extraction of RNA of sufficient quantity and quality from routine oropharyngeal swabs. Despite these limitations, this approach provides the advantages of true native RNA sequencing and does not include amplification steps that could introduce systematic errors.

All this leads to the third conclusion, namely, the solution of the crisis will be achieved using technology and making people competent again and teaching them the right processes.

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) are used in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. NMBA have also been used in COVID-19 patients who required mechanical ventilation (MV), but their benefit-to-risk ratio remains uncertain.METHODS. We investigated the effects associated with the use of NMBA in COVID-19 patients who required MV from January 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 in 153 hospitals across 6 continents, comprising the COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium. Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted to study the impact of NMBA on 28-day intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Hospital/ICU lengths of stay were appraised. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTS. 1227 patients were eligible for analysis, among those 598 (48.7%) received NMBA for 2 days or longer, with a median time from ICU admission to commencement of NMBA therapy of 0 day (IQR 0-1 days). The median duration of NMBA therapy was 2 days (N=789, IQR 1-5). In comparison with standard of care, treatment with NMBA was more frequent in obese (31% vs. 39%, P = 0.03) and diabetic patients (2% vs. 8%, P &lt;0.01) and less frequent in patients with hypertension (52% vs. 46%, P =0.04) or cardiac diseases (21% vs. 14%, P =0.003). Upon commencement of MV, patients who underwent NMBA therapy vs those who did not presented a PaO2/FiO2 of 136.169.2 vs. 162.7 125.8 (p&lt;0.01), required more often ECMO (10% vs 5.2%, p &lt;0.01) and prone position (25.1% vs 6.2%, p &lt;0.01). Unadjusted 28-day all-cause mortality was similar (58.2% vs. 62.4%, P =0.134) between patients without or with NMBA therapy, respectively, but length of MV (3 days [2-5] vs. 6 [3-12] P &lt;0.01) and ICU stay (8 days [4-14] vs. 13 [7-19] P &lt;0.01) were prolonged. After PS matching, NMBA therapy was strongly associated with 28-day ICU mortality (adjusted HR 3.18, 95% CI 2.65-3.81, P &lt;0.01). CONCLUSION.

Here, we investigated the respiratory tract microbiome in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its relationship to disease severity, systemic immunologic features, and outcomes. We examined 507 oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, and endotracheal samples from 83 hospitalized COVID-19 patients as well as non-COVID patients and healthy controls. Bacterial communities were interrogated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the commensal DNA viruses Anelloviridae and Redondoviridae were quantified by qPCR. We found that COVID-19 patients had upper respiratory microbiome dysbiosis and greater change over time than critically ill patients without COVID-19. Oropharyngeal microbiome diversity at the first time point correlated inversely with disease severity during hospitalization. Microbiome composition was also associated with systemic immune parameters in blood, as measured by lymphocyte/neutrophil ratios and immune profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Intubated patients showed patient-specific lung microbiome communities that were frequently highly dynamic, with prominence of Staphylococcus. Anelloviridae and Redondoviridae showed more frequent colonization and higher titers in severe disease. Machine learning analysis demonstrated that integrated features of the microbiome at early sampling points had high power to discriminate ultimate level of COVID-19 severity. Thus, the respiratory tract microbiome and commensal viruses are disturbed in COVID-19 and correlate with systemic immune parameters, and early microbiome features discriminate disease severity. Future studies should address clinical consequences of airway dysbiosis in COVID-19, its possible use as biomarkers, and the role of bacterial and viral taxa identified here in COVID-19 pathogenesis.","output":"Signatures of COVID-19 Severity and Immune Response in the Respiratory Tract Microbiome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness and social isolation have become increasing concerns during COVID-19 lockdown through neuroendocrine stress-reactions, physical and mental health problems.

Divorced/widowed showed highest trait loneliness, followed by singles and partnerships. The latter displayed lower momentary loneliness and cortisol levels compared to singles. Relationship satisfaction significantly reduced loneliness levels in participants with a partner and those who were living apart from their partner reported loneliness levels similar to singles living alone. Living alone was associated with lower loneliness levels. Hierarchical linear models revealed a significant cross-level interaction between relationship status and momentary loneliness in predicting cortisol.

OBJECTIVE: To unravel the most challenging aspects of COVID-19 in a nonclinical adult population and identify predictors of lost balance and consequent allostatic overload (AO). We examined the role of regular, moderate-intensity formula aerobic exercise (312 meridian exercise) in preventing allostatic overload through increasing well-being. METHODS: An online survey was conducted to measure CO-VID-related allostatic overload according to clinimetric criteria. The Psychosocial Index (PSI), Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ), short Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale -(PHS-WB), and Whiteley-7 were used to explore mental health characteristics. Univariate statistics logistic regression analysis and a general linear model were used. RESULTS: According to 442 valid answers, 217 adults practiced physical exercise (PE) frequently (fPE, 3C5 times/every day) while 120 did it less regularly (1C2 times/week), and 105 did not exercise/practiced irregularly (controls). Restriction-related stressors were most challenging, resulting in AO in 29% (n = 128) of the sample. The main predictors were additional stressors (p = 0.005) and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001). The prevalence of AO was lower (p = 0.018) in the fPE group when compared to controls. KSQ distress symptoms were also lower in fPE (p < 0.0001), while total well-being was increased (p < 0.001) after adjusting for sex, age, and number of chronic diseases. According to the PHS-WB, both physical and mental well-being were higher (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively) in fPE.

Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods. METHOD: The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria and patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix. RESULT: An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments. DISCUSSION: The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector.","output":"Helping Doctors Hasten COVID-19 Treatment: Towards a Rescue Framework for the Transfusion of Best Convalescent Plasma to the Most Critical Patients based on Biological Requirements via ML and Novel MCDM Methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Credit restrictions, such as those happening in the current context shaped by the crisis derived from COVID-19, make working capital management (WCM) a driving force behind SME performance.

Information needs of users in such circumstances, either for clinical or research activities, make the role of powerful medical image search engines more significant. In this paper, a text-based multi-dimensional medical image indexing technique is proposed in which correlation of the features-usages (according to the users queries) is considered to provide an off-the content indexing while taking users interestingness into account. Assuming that each medical image has some extracted features (e.g., based on the DICOM standard), correlations of the features are discovered by performing data mining techniques (i.e., quantitative association pattern discovery), on the history of users queries as a data set. Then, based on the pairwise correlation of the features of medical images (a.k.a. Affinity), set of the all features is fragmented into subsets (using method like the vertical fragmentation of the tables in distribution of relational DBs). After that, each of these subsets of the features turn into a hierarchy of the features (by applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm on that subset), subsequently all of these distinct hierarchies together make a multi-dimensional structure of the features of medical images, which is in fact the proposed text-based (feature-based) multi-dimensional index structure. Constructing and using such text-based multi-dimensional index structure via its specific required operations, medical image retrieval process would be improved in the underlying medical image search engine. Generally, an indexing technique is to provide a logical representation of documents in order to optimize the retrieval process. The proposed indexing technique is designed such that can improve retrieval of medical images in a medical image search engine in terms of its effectiveness and efficiency. Considering correlation of the features of the image would semantically improve precision (effectiveness) of the retrieval process, while traversing them through the hierarchy in one dimension would try to optimize (i.e., minimize) the resources to have a better efficiency. The proposed text-based multi-dimensional indexing technique is implemented using the open source search engine Lucene, and compared with the built-in indexing technique available in the Lucene search engine, and also with the Terrier platform (available for the benchmarking of information retrieval systems) and other the most related indexing techniques. Evaluation results of memory usage and time complexity analysis, beside the experimental evaluations efficiency and effectiveness measures show that the proposed multi-dimensional indexing technique significantly improves both efficiency and effectiveness for a medical image search engine.

Due to the high zoonotic potential of these viruses, it is critical to unravel their evolutionary history of host species shift, adaptation and emergence. Only such knowledge can guide virus discovery, surveillance and research efforts to identify viruses posing a pandemic risk in humans. We present a comprehensive analysis of the composition and codon usage bias of the 82 Orthocoronavirinae members, infecting 47 different avian and mammalian hosts. Our results clearly establish that synonymous codon usage varies widely among viruses and is only weakly dependent on the type of host they infect. Instead, we identify mutational bias towards AT-enrichment and selection against CpG dinucleotides as the main factors responsible of the codon usage bias variation. Further insight on the mutational equilibrium within Orthocoronavirinae revealed that most coronavirus genomes are close to their neutral equilibrium, the exception is the three recently-infecting human coronaviruses, which lie further away from the mutational equilibrium than their endemic human coronavirus counterparts. Finally, our results suggest that while replicating in humans SARS-CoV-2 is slowly becoming AT-richer, likely until attaining a new mutational equilibrium.","output":"Variability in codon usage in Coronaviruses is mainly driven by mutational bias and selective constraints on CpG dinucleotide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Intensive care unit survivors suffer from prolonged impairment, reduced quality of life, and higher mortality rates after discharge compared to the general population. Socioeconomic status may play a partial but important role in mortality and recovery. Therefore, the detection of factors that are responsible for poor long-term outcomes would be beneficial in designing targeted interventions for at-risk populations. METHODS: For an endpoint analysis, 1834 intensive care unit patients with known French Deprivation Index (FDep) scores were included from the French and euRopean Outcome reGistry in Intensive Care Units (FROG-ICU) study, which was a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study performed in 20 French intensive care units in 13 different hospitals. Socioeconomic status was defined by using the FDep score [represented as quintiles when referring to the general French population, as quintiles when referring to the FROG-ICU cohort, or as dichotomized data (which was defined as a FDep  0 for nondeprived patients)] and by using a detailed social questionnaire that was completed 3 months after discharge. The primary outcome included an all-cause, 1-year mortality after ICU discharge when regarding socioeconomic status. The secondary outcomes included both ICU and hospital lengths of stay, both short- and medium-term mortality, and the quality of life, as assessed during the 1-year follow-up by using the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36). The Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) was used to evaluate the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to screen for anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Of the 1447 patients who were discharged alive from the ICU, 19.2% died over the following year. No association was found between 1-year mortality and socioeconomic status, regardless of whether this association was analyzed in quintiles (p = 0.911 in the quintiles of the general French population; p = 0.589 in the quintiles of the FROG-ICU cohort itself) or as dichotomized data [nondeprived (n = 177; 1-year mortality of 18.2%) versus deprived (n = 97; 1-year mortality of 20.5%; p = 0.304)]. Moreover, no differences were found between the nondeprived and the deprived patients in the ICU and hospital lengths of stay, ICU mortalities, in-hospital mortalities, or 28-day mortalities. The SF-36 was below the score for the normal French population throughout the follow-up period. Socially deprived patients showed significantly lower median scores in the physical function subscale [55, interquartile range (IQR) (28.8C80) vs. 65, IQR (35C90); p = 0.014], the physical role subscale [25, IQR (0C75) vs. 33.3, IQR (0C100); p = 0.022], and the overall physical component scale [47.5, IQR (30C68.8) vs. 54.4, IQR (35C78.8); p = 0.010]. Up to 31.6% of survivors presented symptoms that indicated post-traumatic stress disorder, and up to 31.5% of survivors reported clinically meaningful symptoms of anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: A lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower self-reported physical component scores in the nondeprived patients. Psychiatric symptoms are frequently reported after an ICU stay, and subsequent interventions should target those fields.

This study aimed to investigate the anti\\\\hypoxic activities of dexamethasone to understand a possible mechanism of its action in hypoxia\\\\induced lethality through experimental models of hypoxia. METHODS: In this investigation, 84 Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into groups of seven (12 groups). Treatment groups received 10 days of dexamethasone intraperitoneal injection at both human dose (~0.1 mg/kg) and the animal does (~1 mg/kg). Control negative and positive groups were treated with 10 ml/kg of normal saline and 30 mg/kg of propranolol, respectively. Three experimental models of hypoxia, asphyctic, circulatory, and hemic were applied in this study. RESULTS: The findings showed that dexamethasone significantly prolonged the latency for death in the asphyctic model concerning the control group in both humans (P < .0001) and animal dose (P < .0001). The results were also highly significant for both doses in the hemic model (P < .001). In the circulatory model, although a small increase was observed in death prolongation, results were not statistically significant for both doses in this model (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: This experimental in vivo investigation demonstrated an excellent protective effect for 10 days of dexamethasone treatment against hypoxia, especially in asphyctic and hemic models. In addition to promising dexamethasone outcomes, using propranolol as the positive control illustrated a very substantial anti\\\\hypoxic effect even much better than dexamethasone in all models.

In this context, we aimed to determine the outcome of integrated therapy for COVID-19 using KSK in virologic clearance and length of hospital stay. Methods It was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study. We included the COVID-19 patients admitted to SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Chennai, during May-June 2020.The KSK was administered along with the standard of care for all the patients. We collected demographic, clinical data and laboratory parameters data and were presented as frequencies and proportions. Results We collected 204 COVID-19 positive patients' data. The mean (SD) age was 39.5 (13.4) years with a range of 13-79. Majority of the patients were male (n=157; 77%), 28% (n=58) had any co-morbidities and 61% (n=131) were with mild symptoms. Fever (n=57;27.9%) and cough (n=53; 25.9%) were the commonly reported symptoms. Paracetamol (n=135; 66.7%) and Zincovit (n=197, 96.6%) were the commonly administered medicines along with KSK. About 74% of asymptomatic (n=54) and 65% of mild symptomatic (n=85) patients turned negative for COVID-19 in RT-PCR within 4-7 days. There was a significant difference in the blood parameters (p<0.05) after the integrated treatment.

Mitigation measures included physical distancing, universal masking, and maximizing outdoor activity during training; routine testing; 10-day isolation of persons with COVID-19; and 14-day quarantine of athletes identified as close contacts* of persons with confirmed COVID-19. Regional athletic conferences created testing and quarantine policies based on National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) guidance (1); testing policies varied by conference, school, and sport. To improve compliance with quarantine and reduce the personal and economic burden of quarantine adherence, the quarantine period has been reduced in several countries from 14 days to as few as 5 days with testing (2) or 10 days without testing (3). Data on quarantined athletes participating in NCAA sports were used to characterize COVID-19 exposures and assess the amount of time between quarantine start and first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Despite the potential risk for transmission from frequent, close contact associated with athletic activities (4), more athletes reported exposure to COVID-19 at social gatherings (40.7%) and from roommates (31.7%) than they did from exposures associated with athletic activities (12.7%). Among 1,830 quarantined athletes, 458 (25%) received positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results during the 14-day quarantine, with a mean of 3.8 days from quarantine start (range = 0-14 days) until the positive test result. Among athletes who had not received a positive test result by quarantine day 5, the probability of having a positive test result decreased from 27% after day 5 to <5% after day 10. These findings support new guidance from CDC (5) in which different options are provided to shorten quarantine for persons such as collegiate athletes, especially if doing so will increase compliance, balancing the reduced duration of quarantine against a small but nonzero risk for postquarantine transmission.

However, it remains unclear whether the day of the week of ECMO initiation affects patient outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether the initiation of ECMO therapy during a weekend was associated with increased mortality risk. Methods We performed a population-level cohort study, based on health records obtained from the National Health Insurance Service database in South Korea. All critically ill adult patients who received ECMO therapy in the intensive care unit during 2005-2018 were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the 60-day mortality rate following ECMO therapy. Multivariable Cox regression was used for the analysis. Results Data from a total of 21,129 ECMO patients were included in the analysis, of whom 12,825 (60.7%) died within 60 days. There were 4,647 (22.0%) patients who received ECMO therapy during a weekend (weekend group). Multivariable Cox regression revealed that the weekend group was at increased risk of 60-day mortality compared to the weekday group (hazard ratio: 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.01 to 1.09; P=0.025). In the sensitivity analysis, ECMO patients whose therapy started on a Saturday were at higher risk of 60-day mortality (hazard ratio relative to those whose therapy started on a Wednesday: 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.19; P=0.003). However, starting ECMO therapy on other weekdays (Thursday, Friday, Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday) did not affect mortality outcomes (P>0.05). Conclusions ECMO therapy initiated during a weekend was associated with a slightly increased risk of 60-day mortality compared to that associated with ECMO therapy initiated on a weekday. This association was more evident in patients who received ECMO therapy that started on a Saturday.

During the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fear of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, national lockdowns, and altered health care priorities have highlighted the programs importance in improving STEMI care quality. This study aims to minimize the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of STEMI care, by developing interventions that optimize the QI initiatives, implementing and evaluating the optimized QI initiatives, and developing scale-up activities of the optimized QI initiatives in response to COVID-19 and other public health emergencies. METHODS: A stepped wedge cluster randomized control trial will be conducted in three selected cities of China: Wuhan, Suzhou, and Shenzhen. Two districts have been randomly selected in each city, yielding a total of 24 registered hospitals. This study will conduct a rollout in these hospitals every 3 months. The 24 hospitals will be randomly assigned to four clusters, and each cluster will commence the intervention (optimized QI initiatives) at one of the four steps. We will conduct hospital-based assessments, questionnaire surveys among health care providers, community-based household surveys, and key informant interviews during the trial. All outcome measures will be organized using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework, including implementation outcomes, service outcomes (e.g., treatment time), and patient outcomes (e.g., in-hospital mortality and 1-year complication).

Recently, the guidelines for the management of Chinese HCC patients were updated. Objective The past decade has witnessed a great improvement in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study reviews the recommendations in the 2019 Chinese guidelines and makes comparison with the practices from the Western world. Evidence Review The updated recommendations on the surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment algorithm of HCC in the 2019 Chinese guidelines were summarized, and comparisons among the updated Chinese guidelines, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines were made. Findings Besides imaging and pathological diagnoses, novel biomarkers like the seven-micro-RNA panel are advocated for early diagnoses and therapeutic efficacy evaluation in the updated Chinese guidelines. The China liver cancer (CNLC) staging system, proposed in the 2017 guidelines, continues to be the standard model for patient classification, with subsequent modifications and updates being made in treatment allocations. Compared to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system, the CNLC staging system employs resection, transplantation, and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for more progressed HCC. TACE in combination with other regional therapies like ablation or with systemic therapies like sorafenib are also encouraged in select patients in China. The systemic treatments for HCC have evolved considerably since lenvatinib, regorafenib, carbozantinib, ramucirumab and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)were first prescribed as first-line or second-line agents.

We assess the risk of holding a 2020 NFL season by comparing community and player COVID-19 infections. METHODS: We used county-level COVID-19 test data from each team to establish baseline distributions of infection rates expected to occur in a population similar in age and sex to NFL players. We used a binomial distribution to simulate expected infections in each community cohort and compared these findings with observed COVID-19 infections in players.

We employed a comprehensive eight-stage process to guide this development applying the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour) model for intervention design which specifies the following: (1) define the problem, (2) select the target behaviour, (3) specify the target behaviour, (4) identify what needs to change, (5) identify intervention functions, (6) identify policy categories, (7) select behaviour change techniques, and (8) design a mode of delivery. The development was informed by primary research conducted by the authors, consulting with organisation steering groups and by those with personal experiences. The identified targets for intervention and mode and method of delivery were then refined over 4 intervention development meetings, using the nominal group technique with the ADVANCE experts, then further refined following consultation with service user groups and wider expert groups via a learning alliance meetings.

METHODS: We investigated how IAV may increase the risk of COVID-19 lung disease, focusing on the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 and the protease TMPRSS2, which cooperate in the intracellular uptake of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We found, using single-cell RNA sequencing of distal human nondiseased lung homogenates, that at baseline, ACE2 is minimally expressed in basal, goblet, ciliated and secretory epithelial cells populating small airways. We focused on human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs), central to the pathogenesis of lung injury following viral infections. Primary SAECs from nondiseased donor lungs apically infected (at the air-liquid interface) with IAV (up to 310(5) pfu; ~1 multiplicity of infection) markedly (eight-fold) boosted the expression of ACE2, paralleling that of STAT1, a transcription factor activated by viruses. IAV increased the apparent electrophoretic mobility of intracellular ACE2 and generated an ACE2 fragment (90 kDa) in apical secretions, suggesting cleavage of this receptor. In addition, IAV increased the expression of two proteases known to cleave ACE2, sheddase ADAM17 (TACE) and TMPRSS2 and increased the TMPRSS2 zymogen and its mature fragments, implicating proteolytic autoactivation. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that IAV amplifies the expression of molecules necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the distal lung. Furthermore, post-translational changes in ACE2 by IAV may increase vulnerability to lung injury such as acute respiratory distress syndrome during viral co-infections.

The pandemic triggered a turmoil in public health and is having a tremendous social and economic impact around the globe.

Although the disease is known for prominent respiratory symptoms, accumulating evidence is also demonstrating the involvement of the central nervous system, with possible mid- and long-term neurological consequences. In this study, we conducted a detailed bioinformatic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome aggregation propensity by using several complementary computational tools. Our study identified 10 aggregation prone proteins in the reference SARS-CoV-2 strain: the non-structural proteins Nsp4, Nsp6 and Nsp7 as well as ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF10, CovE and CovM. By searching for the available mutants of each protein, we have found that most proteins are conserved, while ORF3a and ORF7b are variable and characterized by the occurrence of a large number of mutants with increased aggregation propensity. The geographical distribution of the mutants revealed interesting differences in the localization of aggregation-prone mutants of each protein. Aggregation-prone mutants of ORF7b were found in 7 European countries, whereas those of ORF3a in only 2.

The findings raise questions about whether shifts are advantageous for global scientific progress, and whether the research community will return to the original equilibrium or reorganize into a different knowledge configuration.","output":"Topic evolution, disruption and resilience in early COVID-19 research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Der Beitrag besch?ftigt sich anhand des in Deutschland durchgefhrten Arbeitswelt-Monitors \\"Arbeiten in der Corona-Krise\\" mit den Arbeitserfahrungen verschiedener Erwerbsklassen in der Pandemie. Die Befunde gelten fr den deutschen Fall. Allerdings spricht einiges dafr, dass trotz der Unterschiede der Wirtschaftsstruktur und im politischen Umgang mit COVID-19 in ?sterreich vergleichbare Ungleichheitsdynamiken zu beobachten sind. Drei Befunde sind besonders hervorzuheben: COVID-19 verst?rkt bestehende Klassenungleichheiten: Die subjektiven gesundheitlichen Risiken, die wirtschaftlichen Lasten und der Zugang zum mobilen Arbeiten weisen ausgepr?gte vertikale und horizontale Klassenungleichheiten auf. In den unteren Klassen bilden die Benachteiligung gegenber den jeweiligen oberen Klassen, verbreitete Ohnmacht, auch in Pandemiezeiten kaum Einfluss auf die eigene Arbeitssituation nehmen zu k?nnen, und gesellschaftliche Unsichtbarkeit der eigenen Erfahrungen einen gemeinsamen Erfahrungshorizont. Corona-Erfahrungen der unteren Klassen sind fragmentiert: Dienstleistende erleben COVID-19 h?ufiger als Gesundheitsgef?hrdung, Produktionsarbeitende und Kleingewerbetreibende als Wirtschaftskrise und die Brokr?fte als Treiber mobilen Arbeitens. Die Fragmentierung des Erlebens der Pandemie erschwert Solidarisierungsprozesse unter den unteren Klassen. This paper deals with the work experiences of diferent social classes during the pandemic, based on the Work Monitor \\"Working in Corona Crisis\\" conducted in Germany. The fndings apply to the German situation. However, evidence suggests that, despite diferences in the countries' economic structures and the political handling of Covid-19, the results on the pandemic's class dynamics are to some degree transferable to Austria. Three fndings are particularly noteworthy: Covid-19 reinforces existing class inequalities: subjective health risks, economic burdens, and access to mobile work show pronounced vertical and horizontal class inequalities. The lower classes share a common set of experiences, including the disadvantages, compared to the respective upper classes, the powerlessness to exert infuence on their own work situations even in times of pandemic, and the societal invisibility of their own experiences. At the same time, the Corona experiences of the lower classes are fragmented. This fragmentation of the experience of the pandemic impedes the emergence of solidarity among the lower classes.","output":"Corona und die Arbeitswelt der Zukunft: von der gesellschaftlichen (Un-)Sichtbarkeit des Leidens an der Pandemie"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:O}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(D,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/27.md","filePath":"drive/27.md"}'),R={name:"drive/27.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
