Such a model could be a precursor to implementing smart lockdowns and vaccine distribution strategies. METHODS: The training cohort comprised 2337 COVID-19 inpatients from nine hospitals in The Netherlands. The clinical outcome was death within 21 days of being discharged. The features were derived from electronic health records collected during admission. Three feature selection methods were used: LASSO, univariate using a novel metric, and pairwise (age being half of each pair). 478 patients from Belgium were used to test the model. All modeling attempts were compared against an age-only model. RESULTS: In the training cohort, the mortality groups median age was 77 years (interquartile range = 70C83), higher than the non-mortality group (median = 65, IQR = 55C75). The incidence of former/active smokers, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, dementia, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic cardiac disease, chronic neurological disease, and chronic kidney disease was higher in the mortality group. All stated differences were statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. LASSO selected eight features, novel univariate chose five, and pairwise chose none.

SURE UK, which is one of a series of individual studies that comprise the SURE programme, evaluated the use of OW semaglutide in a real-world patient population with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the UK. METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, adults ( 18 years) with  1 documented glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) value  12 weeks before semaglutide initiation were enrolled. The primary endpoint was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to end of study (EOS; ~ 30 weeks, although due to the COVID-19 pandemic, visits up to week 52 were permitted). Secondary endpoints included change in body weight, waist circumference and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Physicians were to report all episodes of documented or severe hypoglycaemia, fatal events, serious adverse drug reactions, pregnancies and adverse events (AEs) in foetuses/newborn infants; other AEs during the study period could be reported on a voluntary basis. RESULT: The estimated mean change in HbA(1c) from baseline to EOS was ? 16.3 mmol/mol [95% confidence interval (CI): ? 18.22, ? 14.37] (? 1.5%-points [95% CI ? 1.67, ? 1.31]; p < 0.0001) among the 171 enrolled patients who completed the study on treatment. Mean body weight change was ? 5.8 kg (95% CI ? 6.75, ? 4.94; p < 0.0001). Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. Improvements were also observed in other secondary endpoints, including PROs. No new safety concerns were identified with semaglutide treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving OW semaglutide experienced statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions from baseline in HbA(1c) and body weight. These results are in line with those of the SUSTAIN RCTs and support the use of OW semaglutide in routine clinical practice in adults with T2D in the UK.

Currently, most efforts on supporting the uptake of digital mental health tools remain fragmented across organizations and geography. There is a critical need to synthesize these efforts in order to provide a coordinated strategy of supporting the adoption of digital mental health tools. OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this project is to develop a web-based resource document to support the engagement of mental health providers and patients in the use of digital mental health tools. METHODS: The web-based resource was developed using a multimethod approach. A grey literature review was conducted in 2019 to identify relevant toolkits that are available in the public domain. This was supplemented with an environmental scan where individuals with expertise in the development, acquisition, implementation, and evaluation of digital mental health tools were invited to contribute additional tools or documents not identified in the grey literature search. An engagement workshop was held with stakeholders to explore how the resource document should be developed and delivered. These findings were collectively used to develop the final iteration of the resource document. RESULTS: Based on a gray literature review and environmental scan with 27 experts, 25 resources were identified and included in the resource guide. These resources were developed for patients and providers by organizations from 5 countries. An engagement workshop was held with 14 stakeholders, and barriers related to cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and accessibility of the toolkit were identified. The final iteration of the resource document was developed by the research team using findings from the gray literature review, environmental scan, and engagement workshop. The contents of the 45-page resource guide are directed at mental health care providers, administrators, and patients (inclusive of families and caregivers). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a multimethod approach led to the development of a resource guide that builds on existing evidence on digital mental health tools and was co-designed with stakeholders and end-users. The resource guide is now publicly available online for free and is being promoted through digital health and mental health websites.

We constructed an empirically-based model of serological detection rates to quantify COVID reporting rates in national and sub-national locations. From those reporting rates, we estimated relative COVID burden, finding results that contrast with estimates based on case counts and modeling. To investigate COVID mortality by age in an LMIC context, we utilized a unique morgue study of COVID in Lusaka alongside the population attributable fraction method to account for HIV comorbidity. We calculated the comorbidity-corrected age-adjusted mortality curve in Lusaka and found it significantly skewed toward younger age groups as compared to HICs. This unexpected result recommends against the unexamined use of HIC-derived parameterizations of COVID characteristics in LMIC settings, and challenges the hypothesis of an age-structure protective factor for COVID burden in Africa. Indeed, we found overall COVID burden to be higher in Lusaka than in HICs. Concurrent with high COVID burden, many LMICs have high prevalence of other public health issues such as HIV, which compete for limited health investment resources. Given differences in age-structure, comorbidities, and healthcare delivery costs, we provide a case study comparing the cost efficacy of investment in COVID versus HIV and found that even in a high HIV prevalence setting, investment in COVID remains cost-effective. As a whole, these analyses have broad implications for interpretations of COVID burden, modeling applications, and policy decision-making. Significance StatementThe analyses presented here demonstrate the power of auxiliary COVID data sources to fill information gaps, particularly for LMICs. Our results reveal differences in COVID surveillance and disease dynamics between HICs and LMICs that challenge common perceptions and assumptions about COVID in these respective contexts. We show the divergence of COVID reporting rates between HICs and LMICs and the effects on relative estimated burden. Contradicting common modeling practices, our analysis demonstrates that the age-structure of COVID mortality cannot be accurately generalized from HICs to LMICs. We find higher COVID burden in LMIC contexts than HICs particularly in younger age groups and show that investment in COVID is cost-effective even in light of other public health concerns.","output":"Regional comparisons of COVID reporting rates, burden, and mortality age-structure using auxiliary data sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 11 June WHO announced that the spread of H1N1 had reached pandemic phase 6.

Comprehensive assessment of the multifaceted anti-viral antibody response is critical for diagnosis, differentiation of severe disease, and characterization of long-term immunity. Initial observations suggest that severe disease is associated with higher antibody levels and greater B cell/plasmablast responses. A multi-antigen immunoassay to define the complex serological landscape and clinical associations is essential. Methods We developed a multiplex immunoassay and evaluated serum/plasma from adults with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections during acute illness (N=52) and convalescence (N=69); and pre-pandemic (N=106) and post-pandemic (N=137) healthy adults. We measured IgA, IgG, and/or IgM against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N), Spike domain 1 (S1), receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) and S1-N-terminal domain (S1-NTD). Results To diagnose infection, the combined [IgA+IgG+IgM] or IgG for N, S1, and S1-RBD yielded AUC values ?0.90 by ROC curves. From days 6-30 post-symptom onset, the levels of antigen-specific IgG, IgA or [IgA+IgG+IgM] were higher in patients with severe/critical compared to mild/moderate infections. Consistent with excessive concentrations of antibodies, a strong prozone effect was observed in sera from severe/critical patients. Notably, mild/moderate patients displayed a slower rise and lower peak in anti-N and anti-S1 IgG levels compared to severe/critical patients, but anti-RBD IgG and neutralization responses reached similar levels at 2-4 months. Conclusion This SARS-CoV-2 multiplex immunoassay measures the magnitude, complexity and kinetics of the antibody response against multiple viral antigens. The IgG and combined-isotype SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay is highly diagnostic of acute and convalescent disease and may prognosticate severity early in illness.

METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study of eligible adolescents and adults from the Africa Health Research Institute demographic surveillance area in the uMkhanyakude district of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The participants, who were 15 years or older, were invited to participate at a mobile health camp. Medical history for HIV, tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes was established through a questionnaire. Blood pressure measurements, chest x-rays, and tests of blood and sputum were taken to estimate the population prevalence and geospatial distribution of HIV, active and lifetime tuberculosis, elevated blood glucose, elevated blood pressure, and combinations of these. FINDINGS: 17 118 adolescents and adults were recruited from May 25, 2018, to Nov 28, 2019, and assessed.

Appropriate treatment and optimal disease control was highest for HIV (781%), and lower for elevated blood pressure (425%), active tuberculosis (296%), and elevated blood glucose (71%). Disease prevalence differed notably by sex, across age groups, and geospatially: men had a higher prevalence of active and lifetime tuberculosis, whereas women had a substantially high prevalence of HIV at 30C49 years and an increasing prevalence of multiple and poorly controlled non-communicable diseases when older than 50 years. INTERPRETATION: We found a convergence of infectious and non-communicable disease epidemics in a rural South African population, with HIV well treated relative to all other diseases, but tuberculosis, elevated blood glucose, and elevated blood pressure poorly diagnosed and treated. A public health response that expands the successes of the HIV testing and treatment programme to provide multidisease care targeted to specific populations is required to optimise health in such settings in sub-Saharan Africa.

During an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the LTCF an effective screening tool is essential to identify the patients at risk for severe disease. We explored the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a predictor for severe disease during the outbreak of Covid-19 in one LTCF in Slovakia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of cases of COVID-19, diagnosed during the outbreak in one LTCF in Slovakia between April 11, 2020, and May 5, 2020. Within 24 h after the diagnosis of Covid-19, clinical and laboratory screening was performed in the LTCF to identify patients in need of hospitalization. Patients with oxygen saturation below 90% were immediately referred to the hospital. Patients staying in the LFTC were monitored daily and those that developed hypoxemia were transferred to the hospital. We analyzed the association between the IL-6 at the initial assessment and development of hypoxemia during follow up and determined the cut-off of the IL-6 able to predict the development of hypoxemia requiring oxygen therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (11 men, 42 women) with diagnosed Covid-19 were included in the analysis. 19 (53%) patients developed hypoxemia during the disease. Patients with hypoxemia had significantly higher concentrations of IL-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase at initial screening. ROC analyses identified IL-6 as the most robust predictor of hypoxemia. The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL predicted the development of hypoxemia with the sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88.9%. The positive and negative predictive values were 76.9, and 100% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The concentration of IL-6 > 24 pg/mL at initial assessment predicted the development of hypoxemia requiring hospitalization with excellent sensitivity and good specificity. IL-6 appears as a potential predictor for the development of the severe Covid-19 and might serve for early identification of patients in need of hospitalization. Further studies are needed to evaluate the robustness of the use of IL-6 as an effective screening tool for the severe course of Covid-19.","output":"Role of interleukin 6 as a predictive factor for a severe course of Covid-19: retrospective data analysis of patients from a long-term care facility during Covid-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Legacy interventions are standard in most children's hospital, but little is known about how bereaved parents understand and describe the concept of legacy that these interventions are designed to document. The aim of this qualitative study was to understand the legacy experiences and perceptions of parents who have experienced perinatal or early infant (less than three months of age) loss. METHODS: Grounded in constructionist epistemology and phenomenological qualitative traditions, ten bereaved parents completed an in-depth phenomenological interview regarding their perceptions of and experiences with the legacy of their deceased child. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using an open, inductive coding process to illuminate the essence of participants' experiences. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: 1) legacies are composed of memories and experiences that have a lasting effect on others; 2) healthcare experiences both generate and participate in infants' legacies; and 3) parents' legacy perceptions are shaped by cultural conceptions, spiritual beliefs, and grief experiences. Parents described experiences and interactions with community members and healthcare providers that honored or challenged their perceptions of their child's unique legacy. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of perinatal or early infant loss, bereaved parents describe legacy as enduring, unique to each child and family, and heavily influenced by healthcare experiences and staff relationships. Parent-led, legacy-oriented interventions are needed in maternal/fetal, labor/delivery, and neonatal intensive care settings to support parent coping with loss.","output":"Little time, lasting impact: Bereaved caregiver perceptions of legacy in perinatal and infant loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to environmental recovery in some ecosystems from a global \\"anthropause,\\" yet such evidence for natural resources with extraction or production value (e.g., fisheries) is limited.

Hyponatremia has been associated with a worse outcome in several pathologic conditions The main objective of this study was to determine whether serum sodium alterations may be independent predictors of the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design and methods: In this observational study, data from 441 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a University Hospital were collected. After excluding 61 patients (no serum sodium at admission available, saline solution infusion before sodium assessment, transfer from another hospital), data from 380 patients were analyzed. Results: 274 (72.1%) patients had normonatremia at admission, 87 (22.9%) patients had hyponatremia and 19 (5%) patients had hypernatremia. We found an inverse correlation between serum sodium and IL-6, whereas a direct correlation between serum sodium and PaO2/FiO2 ratio was observed. Patients with hyponatremia had a higher prevalence of non-invasive ventilation and ICU transfer than those with normonatremia or hypernatremia. Hyponatremia was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (2.7-fold increase vs normonatremia) and each mEq/L of serum sodium reduction was associated with a 14.4% increased risk of death.

Unfortunately, the information about early prediction factors for disease progression is relatively limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the risk factors of developing severe disease. The objective of the study was to reveal the risk factors of developing severe disease by comparing the differences in the hemocyte count and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Methods In this retrospectively analyzed cohort, 141 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17, 2020 to February 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics and hemocyte counts of severe and non-severe COVID patients were collected. The differences in the hemocyte counts and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. A concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy. Results The data showed that the white blood cell count, neutrophil count and platelet count were normal on the day of hospital admission in most COVID-19 patients (87.9%, 85.1% and 88.7%, respectively). A total of 82.8% of severe patients had lymphopenia after the onset of symptoms, and as the disease progressed, there was marked lymphopenia. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the neutrophil count (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.441, 95% CI = 1.954-10.090, p = 0.000), lymphocyte count (HR = 0.255, 95% CI = 0.097-0.669, p = 0.006) and platelet count (HR = 0.244, 95% CI = 0.111-0.537, p = 0.000) were independent risk factors for disease progression. The C-index (0.821 [95% CI, 0.746-0.896]), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram can be used to predict the disease progression in COVID-19 patients accurately. In addition, the data involving the neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and platelet count (NLP score) have something to do with improving risk stratification and management of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions We designed a clinically predictive tool which is easy to use for assessing the progression risk of COVID-19, and the NLP score could be used to facilitate patient stratification management.","output":"The hemocyte counts as a potential biomarker for predicting disease progression in COVID-19: a retrospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In some situations, a decision is best represented by an incompletely analyzed act: conditionally on a given event A, the consequences of the decision on sub-events are perfectly known and uncertainty becomes probabilizable, whereas the plausibility of this event itself remains vague and the decision outcome on the complementary event [Formula: see text] is imprecisely known.

Questions evaluated interest in de\\\\escalation trial participation, perceived barriers/facilitators to participation, and language describing de\\\\escalation. RESULTS: Sixteen patient advocates and 24 patients were interviewed. Key barriers to de\\\\escalation included fear of recurrence, worry about decision regret, lack of clinical trial interest, and dislike for focus on less treatment. Facilitators included trust in physician recommendation, toxicity avoidance, monitoring for progression, perception of good prognosis, and impact on daily life. Participants reported that the COVID\\\\19 pandemic made them more likely to avoid chemotherapy if possible. Of 91 survey respondents, many (43%) patients would have been unwilling to participation in a de\\\\escalation clinical trial. The most commonly reported barrier to participation was fear of recurrence (85%). Few patients (19%) considered clinical trials themselves as a barrier to de\\\\escalation trial participation. The most popular terminology describing chemotherapy de\\\\escalation was lowest effective chemotherapy dose (53%); no patients preferred the term de\\\\escalation.

METHODS For this prospective study, 98 patients with residual HCC lesions after TACE treatment were enrolled between June 2017 and December 2020. All the lesions were invisible on conventional ultrasound scans. Percutaneous RFA was performed using either CEUS (CEUS group, 52 lesions) or virtual navigation (VN group, 46 lesions) guidance. The lesion display rate, disease-free survival rate, local recurrence rate, overall survival rate and complication incidence were calculated and compared. RESULTS Fusion imaging had a significant impact on the RFA outcomes (hazard ratio, 2.629; 95% confidence interval, 1.256-5.505; p = .01). The median disease-free survival time of the VN group was significantly higher than that of the CEUS group (10.9 vs. 8.8 months; p = .007). The local recurrence rates after 3, 6 and 12 months in the VN group were significantly lower than those in the CEUS group (p = .014, .002 and .011). The minor complication rate was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS CEUS-CECT/CEMRI fusion imaging for guiding RFA enables an efficient and useful therapy of inconspicuous HCC lesions after TACE.

However, HLH is a rare disease and has not been well described in critically ill patients. METHODS We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest all-payer inpatient care database publicly available in the United States to identify all adult discharges with Hemophagocytic syndrome (ICD-9 CM code 288.4) between 2007 and 2015. Critical illness was considered present if patient had either ICD-9 CM code indicating the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation or the presence of shock. We used ICD-9-CM codes to identify various infections (inf-HLH), malignancies (mal-HLH) and autoimmune diseases associated with HLH (MAS-HLH) and classified them in their respective groups. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients. We developed multivariable regression model to examine variables associated with mortality in critically ill HLH patients. P value was kept at < 0.05. RESULTS Of the 7420 (95% CI 6959-7881) estimated discharges with HLH, 2313 (31%) were critically ill. Of the critically ill patients, 442 (34%) were mal-HLH, 422 (43.3%) were inf-HLH, 403 (30.7%) were MAS-HLH and 1046 (27.3%) were unable to be classified. In hospital mortality rates were 6.4% in non-critically ill and 48.4% in critically ill patients. Among the subtypes of HLH, in-hospital mortality was 53% in mal-HLH, 49.4% in inf-HLH, 26% in MAS-HLH and 54.6% in unclassified group. On multivariable regression analysis, development of acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.29-3.3, P=0.002) and acute hepatic failure (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.38-3.52, P=0.001) were significantly associated with higher mortality.

Spondylolisthesis and scoliosis are two of the most common ailments with an incidence of 5% and 3% in the United States population, respectively. Both of these abnormalities can affect children at a young age and, if left untreated, can progress into severe pain. Moreover, severe scoliosis can even lead to lung and heart problems. Thus, early diagnosis can make it easier to apply remedies/interventions and prevent further disease progression. Current diagnosis methods are based on visual inspection by physicians of radiographs and/or calculation of certain angles (e.g., Cobb angle). Traditional artificial intelligence-based diagnosis systems utilized these parameters to perform automated classification, which enabled fast and easy diagnosis supporting tools. However, they still require the specialists to perform error-prone tedious measurements. To this end, automated measurement tools were proposed based on processing techniques of X-ray images. In this paper, we utilize advances in deep transfer learning to diagnose spondylolisthesis and scoliosis from X-ray images without the need for any measurements. We collected raw data from real X-ray images of 338 subjects (i.e., 188 scoliosis, 79 spondylolisthesis, and 71 healthy). Deep transfer learning models were developed to perform three-class classification as well as pair-wise binary classifications among the three classes. The highest mean accuracy and maximum accuracy for three-class classification was 96.73% and 98.02%, respectively. Regarding pair-wise binary classification, high accuracy values were achieved for most of the models (i.e., > 98%).

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled hospitalized children aged <16 years with LRTI from 2006 to 2015. Children were clinically examined, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed using semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped. RESULTS: A total of 171 children had HMPV infection. HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations. No clinical differences were found between HMPV genotypes A (n = 67) and B (n = 80). The HMPV-infected children were older (median 17.2 months) than RSV-infected children (median 7.3 months, n = 859). Among single virus-infected children, no differences in age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses were found between HMPV and RSV. Age was an important factor for disease severity among single virus-infected children, where children <6 months old with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12C23 months old, the pattern was the opposite. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for each virus type, age 12 months (HMPV), and age <6 months (RSV), prematurity, 1 chronic disease and high viral loads of RSV, but not high HMPV viral loads, were risk factors for severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV manifests independently of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes.

Cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and interleukin (IL)-3 induce class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression on neural cells. IFN-, the most potent inducer of MHC antigen, also induces class II MHC antigen expression on microglia and astrocytes, which enable them to function as antigen-presenting cells. Thus, in some pathological conditions, invading T cells can interact with neural cells to induce central nervous system (CNS) damage. Glial cells have also been shown to produce various cytokines and chemokines. Almost all cytokines and chemokines known to occur in the immune system are also produced in the CNS.

The chickens were inoculated at 7 and 14 days of age. On 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 post first vaccination, the dynamic changes of peripheral lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine assays and serum antibody titers were assayed respectively by MTT method, ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI). The results showed that sodium new houttuyfonate significantly raised IB antibody titer in the chickens and also markedly promoted lymphocyte proliferation. The serum levels of IFN- and IL-4 in groups 1C4 were higher than those in groups 5 and 6. Hence, the immunologic enhancement of SNH was slightly superior to that of IL-2 adjuvant. Following challenge with IBV, chickens inoculated with SNH showed fewer and less severe clinical signs, lower death rate and less kidney pathology, as compared to those of the control groups. It indicated that SNH could enhance immune responses and increase protection against virulent IBV challenge in chickens.","output":"Immune response of AA broilers to IBV H120 vaccine and sodium new houttuyfonate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing efforts to contain its spread have caused major problems with public health, along with social and economic disruptions.

In this case-control study we investigated the diurnal free bioavailable salivary cortisol secretion in COVID-19 patients. Methods: : Fifty-two consecutive COVID-19 patients -before dexamethasone treatment- recruited between April 15 th -June15 th -2021, (NCT04988269) at Laikon Athens University-Hospital, and 33 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were included. Diurnal salivary cortisol (8am, 12, 6, and 10pm), plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and aldosterone, and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were assessed. Diurnal salivary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and IL-6 were also assessed in subgroups of patients. Results: Median CRP and IL-6 measurements were about 6-fold higher in patients than controls (both p<0.001) Morning salivary cortisol levels did not differ between the two groups, but patients exhibited higher median levels of evening and nocturnal salivary cortisol compared to controls [0.391(0.054, 0,663) vs. 0.081(0.054, 0.243)g/dl, p<0.001 and 0.183(0.090, 0.834) vs. 0.054(0.054, 0.332)g/dl, p<0.001, respectively], resulting in higher time-integrated area under the curve (AUC) (4.812.46 vs. 2.750.810, respectively, p<0.001 ). Circulating ACTH, DHEA, and aldosterone levels were similar in patients and controls. Serum IL-6, but not ACTH levels, WAS strongly correlated with nocturnal cortisol salivary levels (rho=0.555, p<0.001 ) in patients. Conclusion: Increased evening and nocturnal but not morning cortisol secretion occur in even clinically mild COVID-19.

However, these providers may have lower thresholds for prescribing certain drugs. This is a particular concern for antibiotics, given the increasing burden of antimicrobial resistance. Public preferences for consultations with online providers are unknown, hence the impact of increased availability of online consultations on antibiotic use and population health is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a discrete choice experiment survey to understand UK public preferences for seeking online consultations, and the factors that influence these preferences, in the context of having symptoms for which antibiotics may be appropriate. METHODS: In a survey conducted between July and August 2018, general population respondents completed 16 questions in which they chose a primary care consultation via either their local medical centre or an online provider. Consultations were described in terms of five attributes, including cost and similarity to traditional 'face-to-face' appointments. Choices were modelled using regression analysis. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 734) placed a high value on having a consultation via their local medical centre rather than an online provider, and a low value on consultations by phone or video. However, respondents characterised as 'busy young professionals' showed a lower strength of preference for traditional consultations, with a higher concern for convenience. CONCLUSION: Before COVID-19, the UK public had limited appetite for consultations with online providers, or for consultations that were not face-to-face. Nevertheless, prescriptions from online providers should be monitored going forward, particularly for antibiotics, and in key patient groups.","output":"Preferences for Medical Consultations from Online Providers: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Barcelona city (Spain) is applying a series of traffic restriction measures that aim at renewing and reducing the amount of circulating vehicles to improve air quality. The measures include changes in the built environment to reduce private vehicle space in specific areas through the so-called \\"superblocks\\" and tactical urban planning actions, along with the implementation of a city-wide Low Emission Zone (LEZ) that restricts the entry of the most polluting vehicles to the city. Our study quantifies the impact of these measures in the greater area of Barcelona combining a coupled macroscopic traffic and pollutant emission model with a multi-scale air quality model. Our modelling system allows estimating the effect of different traffic restrictions upon traffic and the associated emissions and air quality levels at a very high resolution (20 m). The measures were evaluated both individually and collectively to assess both their relative and overall impact upon emissions and air quality. We show that in the absence of traffic demand reductions, the application of isolated measures that reduce private vehicle space, either through superblocks or tactical urban planning, have no overall emission impacts; only localized street-level NOx positive and negative changes (17%) are found due to traffic re-routing and the generation of new bottlenecks. It is only when these measures are combined with optimistic fleet renewal as a result of the LEZ implementation and demand reductions, that relevant global emission reductions in NOx are obtained (-13% and -30%, respectively) with estimated NO2 reductions of -36% and -23% at the two traffic air quality monitoring stations.

Long bone fracture (LBF) may lead to the recognition of abuse in young abused children. OBJECTIVES: This study is the first to report the incidence and features of ICI in children with abuse and LBFs. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of children younger than 3 years with the diagnosis of LBF in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2009 to 2014. LBF, abuse, and clinical features were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Abuse-related LBF with and without ICI were compared to identify risk factors for ICI. RESULTS: There were 4345 encounters for abuse-related LBF in kids ages < 3 years; 970 (22%) had ICI. Infants < 1 year of age were more likely to have ICI compared with older children (odds ratio [OR] 1.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38C2.33). After adjusting for age, fracture of the ulna, radius, tibia, or fibula were associated with greater odds of ICI (OR 3.35, 95% CI 2.81C4.00). Abuse-related LBF with additional findings of skull fracture, rib fracture, or head/neck bruising had an increased odds of ICI (OR 8.27, 95% CI 6.85C9.98; OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.28C3.14; OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.99C2.92, respectively).

Sixty African American participants (92% female) age 65 and older were recruited from the Wayne State University Institute of Gerontology Healthier Black Elders Center. In addition to initial demographic questions, the scale (5-point Likert scale from Not At All to A Great Deal) assessed a range of everyday concerns, such as time spent indoors; family relationships; economic problems; restricted freedom of movement; and access to food, cleaning supplies, medical care, and personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants also completed a brief generalized anxiety screener, GAD-7. Of the 60 participants, 5 reported they were COVID-19 infected and their responses were not used for the analyses. Older Black Americans reported that during the pandemic, they were most affected by: Illness in Family (53%), Death in Family (35%) and Isolation (75%). Significant risk factors for anxiety were: Missing Close Ones, Annoyance, Sense of Safety, Media Coverage, and Time Indoors (explaining 58% of variance).

Accumulating evidence has shown that oxidative stress is characterized by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The inflammatory signaling cascades are initiated through the recognition of host cell-derived damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and microorganism-derived pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). In this review, the effects of PRRs from the Toll-like (TLRs), the retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and the NOD-like (NLRs) families, and the activation of these signaling pathways in regulating the production of ROS and/or oxidative stress are summarized.

CASSIE provides an effective path to target master keys to control the repair-replication interface for cancer cells and SARS CoV-2 pathogenesis as exemplified here by specific targeting of Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) and ADP-ribose glycohydrolase ARH3 macrodomains plus SARS CoV-2 nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3) Macrodomain 1 (Mac1) and Nsp15 nuclease. As opposed to the classical massive effort employing libraries with large numbers of compounds against single proteins, we make inhibitor design for multiple targets efficient. Our compact, chemically diverse, 5000 compound Goldilocks (GL) library has an intermediate number of compounds sized between fragments and drugs with predicted favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and toxicological profiles. Amalgamating our core GL library with an approved drug (AD) library, we employ a combined GLAD library virtual screen, enabling an effective and efficient design cycle of ranked computer docking, top hit biophysical and cell validations, and defined bound structures using human proteins or their avatars. As new drug design is increasingly pathway directed as well as molecular and mechanism based, our CASSIE approach facilitates testing multiple related targets by efficiently turning a set of interacting drug discovery problems into a tractable medicinal chemistry engineering problem of optimizing affinity and ADME properties based upon early co-crystal structures. Optimization efforts are made efficient by a computationally-focused iterative chemistry and structure screen.

Age 55 years (OR 11.1, 95%CI:1.8C68.0), systemic corticosteroid use (OR:4.6, 95%CI:0.7C30.1), active IBD (OR:3.8, 95%CI:0.7C20.8) and comorbidity (OR:4.9, 95%CI:0.8C28.6) were associated with severe COVID. After initial infection, 61% received vaccinations. Conclusions The prevalence of COVID-19 among patients with IBD was lower than the general population. Severe COVID and flare of IBD were relatively rare. Older age, comorbidities, active IBD, and corticosteroid, but not biological therapy were associated with severe COVID.

As an indispensable trace element, Selenium (Se) plays important roles in antioxidant defence and redox state regulation along with a variety of specific metabolic pathways. In recent decades, with the development of novel nanotechnology, Selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) emerged as a promising agent for biomedical uses due to their low toxicity, degradability and high bioavailability. Taking the advantages of the strong ability to trigger apoptosis or autophagy by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), Se NPs have been widely used for direct anticancer treatments and pathogen killing/clearance in host cells. With excellent stability and drug encapsulation capacity, Se NPs are now serving as a kind of powerful nano-carriers for anti-cancer, anti-inflammation and anti-infection treatments. Notably, Se NPs are also found to play critical roles in immunity regulations, such as macrophage and T effector cell activation, which thus provides new possibilities to achieve novel nano-immune synergetic strategy for anti-cancer and anti-infection therapies. In this review, we summarized the progress of preparation methods for Se NPs, followed by the advances of their biological functions and mechanisms for biomedical uses, especially in the field of anti-infection treatments. Moreover, we further provide some prospects of Se NPs in anti-infectious diseases, which would be helpful for facilitating their future research progress for anti-infection therapy.","output":"The Advancing of Selenium Nanoparticles Against Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Actions with identical goals can be executed in different ways (gentle, rude, vigorous, etc.), which D.

Aim of this study is to describe frequency, clinical and radiological features, and 3-month outcomes of patients with IS and COVID-19 in a nationwide stroke registry. METHODS From the Swiss Stroke Registry (SSR), we included all consecutive IS patients 18 years admitted to Swiss Stroke Centers or Stroke Units during the first wave of COVID-19 (25/02 to 08/06/2020). We compared baseline features, etiology and 3-month outcome of SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ IS patients to SARS-CoV-2 PCR- and/or asymptomatic non-tested IS patients. RESULTS Of the 2341 IS patients registered in the SSR during the study period, 36 (1.5%) had confirmed COVID-19 infection, of whom 33 within one month before or after stroke onset. In multivariate analysis, COVID+ patients had more lesions in multiple vascular territories (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.08-5.14, p=0.032) and less cryptogenic strokes (OR=0.37, 95%CI=0.14-0.99, p=0.049). COVID-19 was judged the likely principal cause of stroke in 8 patients (24%), a contributing/triggering factor in 12(36%) and likely not contributing to stroke in 13(40%). There was a strong trend towards worse functional outcome in COVID+ patients after propensity score (PS) adjustment for age, stroke severity and revascularization treatments (PS-adjusted common OR for shift towards higher mRS=1.85, 95%CI 0.96-3.58, p=0.07). CONCLUSION In this nationwide analysis of consecutive ischemic strokes, concomitant COVID-19 was relatively rare.

Therefore, this study investigates the readiness of biology teachers to face online learning based on their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). The purposive survey method was used by distributing questionnaires and conducting online interviews. The questionnaire consists of 30 statements about the TPACK readiness of biology teachers and ten questions about the online learning process during the COVID-19 outbreak.

However, these organizations need appropriate tools to measure and mitigate their climate impacts. One commonly applied method is carbon footprint analysis. Carbon footprint analyses have been conducted for various types of organizations, but knowledge organizations, such as universities and research institutes, have received far less attention, because their carbon footprint is often less visible and can be easily underestimated. This study is based on the carbon footprint analysis of one multinational knowledge organization. This analysis then helped identify the major sources of climate impacts in other such knowledge organizations. These are mainly indirect emissions (Scope 3) and to a large extent (79%) travel-related emissions. Based on these findings, three scenarios for a post-COVID-19 world were developed and analyzed. The results from the first two scenarios showed that despite a reduction in business travel and employees working from home, Scope 3 and travel-related emissions would remain the largest contributor. Only in the unlikely case of the third, non-recovery scenario did the share of travel-related emissions drop, turning heating into the largest contributor. In addition to measuring the carbon footprint, the study discusses potential mitigation strategies knowledge organizations could apply to reduce their carbon footprint.

RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to determine if tocilizumab benefits patients hospitalized with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational study of consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and followed up through April 21, 2020, was conducted by chart review. Patients were treated with tocilizumab using an algorithm that targeted CRS. Survival and mechanical ventilation (MV) outcomes were reported for 14 days and stratified according to disease severity designated at admission (severe, &#8805; 3 L supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation > 93%). For tocilizumab-treated patients, pre/post analyses of clinical response, biomarkers, and safety outcomes were assessed. Post hoc survival analyses were conducted for race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Among the 239 patients, median age was 64 years; 36% and 19% were black and Hispanic, respectively. Hospital census increased exponentially, yet MV census did not. Severe disease was associated with lower survival (78% vs 93%; P < .001), greater proportion requiring MV (44% vs 5%; P < .001), and longer median MV days (5.5 vs 1.0; P = .003). Tocilizumab-treated patients (n = 153 [64%]) comprised 90% of those with severe disease; 44% of patients with nonsevere disease received tocilizumab for evolving CRS. Tocilizumab-treated patients with severe disease had higher admission levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (120 vs 71 mg/L; P < .001) and received tocilizumab sooner (2 vs 3 days; P < .001), but their survival was similar to that of patients with nonsevere disease (83% vs 91%; P = .11). For tocilizumab-treated patients requiring MV, survival was 75% (95% CI, 64-89). Following tocilizumab treatment, few adverse events occurred, and oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6) improved; however, D-dimer and soluble IL-2 receptor (also termed CD25) levels increased significantly. Survival in black and Hispanic patients, after controlling for age, was significantly higher than in white patients (log-rank test, P = .002). INTERPRETATION: A treatment algorithm that included tocilizumab to target CRS may influence MV and survival outcomes. In tocilizumab-treated patients, oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers improved, with higher than expected survival.

The most common comorbidities were as follows: hypertension (49.2%), diabetes (18.8%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12.8%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (34.7%) and acute kidney injury (13.9%) were the most common complications. In-hospital mortality was 20.9%. PSI and CURB-65 showed the highest AUROC (0.835 and 0.825, respectively). qSOFA and MuLBSTA had a lower AUROC (0.728 and 0.715, respectively). qSOFA was the most specific score (specificity 95.7%) albeit its sensitivity was only 26.2%. PSI had the highest sensitivity (84.1%) and a specificity of 72.2%. CONCLUSIONS: PSI and CURB-65, specific severity scores for pneumonia, were better than qSOFA and MuLBSTA at predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Additionally, qSOFA, the simplest score to perform, was the most specific albeit the least sensitive.","output":"Severity Scores in COVID-19 Pneumonia: a Multicenter, Retrospective, Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Telemedicine is a promising solution to extend traditional health care services. Even though mainly discussed during the past two decades, its roots go back into the past century and even further, considering the use of bonfires to warn other villages of diseases. Insights from historical cases can therefore be useful for the ongoing discussion regarding the successful implementation of telemedicine. SUBJECT AND METHODS: We analyzed three historical telemedicine cases (varying regarding time and place) and extracted their success factors and barriers as well as assessed their maturity by using the Telemedicine Community Readiness Model (TCRM). Evidence-based categories of success factors and barriers as well as the TCRMs dimensions were used as deductive categories to analyze the study materials content. RESULTS: The analysis showed that the readiness for telemedicine is higher when the technology is the only option to access health care services. In all three cases, core readiness played a central role. However, the health sector, existing technology, and finance were barriers present at all times, while during pandemics, some barriers are only temporarily removed, for example, by putting legal issues on hold. The analyzed cases were all on lower levels of maturity as they mainly represent pilot tests or exceptional circumstances. CONCLUSION: Results indicate the important core functions in telemedicine initiatives as well as the diversity of their circumstances. Insights from such historical meta-perspectives can, for example, help to strengthen the sustainability of the increased use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic and scale up current telemedicine projects.","output":"Sauerbruch, STARPAHC, and SARS: Historical Perspectives on Readiness and Barriers in Telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quickly developed therapeutic, prophylactic, and vaccine treatments will be essential to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic Standard regulatory and development proto","output":"Regulators Could Allow Early Use of Covid-19 Vaccine or Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A potential link between mortality, d-dimer values, and a prothrombotic syndrome has been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

The pathophysiology of renal failure in this context is not fully understood, but likely to be multifactorial. The intensive care unit outcomes of patients following COVID-19 acute critical illness with associated AKI have not been fully explored. We conducted a cohort study to investigate the risk factors for acute kidney injury in patients admitted to and intensive care unit with COVID-19, its incidence and associated outcomes. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of all patients admitted to our adult intensive care unit suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection from 3 rd March 2020 until 10 th May 2020. Acute kidney injury was defined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria. The outcome analysis was assessed up to date as 15 th of June 2020. Results: A total of 81 patients admitted during this period. All patients had acute hypoxic respiratory failure and needed either noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilatory support. Thirty-six patients (44%) had evidence of AKI (Stage I-33%, Stage II-22%, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)-44%). All patients with AKI stage III had RRT. Age, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, lymphopenia, high D-Dimer levels, increased APACHE II and SOFA scores, mechanical ventilation and use of inotropic or vasopressor support were significantly associated with AKI. The peak AKI was at day 4 and mean duration of RRT was 9 days. The mortality was 25% for the AKI group compared to 7% in those without AKI. Among those received RRT and survived their illness, the renal function recovery is complete and back to baseline in 92% of patients. Conclusion: Acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy is common in critically ill patients presenting with COVID-19.

This report describes the initial COVID-19 experience of the single healthcare system serving Jackson County, Mississippi. The intent of this retrospective review of COVID-19 hospitalized patients was to identify any characteristics or interventions amenable to improving care management and clinical outcomes for patients within our community hospital. METHODS All hospitalized patients 18 years of age and older in our health system with positive tests for COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 [SARS CoV-2]) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March 15 and April 10, 2020 are included in this retrospective observational report. RESULTS During the study period, 158 patients of the 1384 tested (11.4%) were positive for COVID-19 infection. Of the 158 patients, 41 (26%) were hospitalized, with 17 (41%) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The remaining 24 patients did not require ICU admission. The mean age of the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 55 years (range 2-103). Obesity was noted in 68% of the hospitalized patients, including 13 (54%) of the non-ICU patients and 15 (88%) of the ICU patients. All 9 deceased patients were obese. Twelve of 17 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 3 patients received only high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Only 25% (3 of 12) of the IMV patients were successfully extubated during the study period. The median duration on IMV was 17 days (range 4-35). The mortality in the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 5.7% (9 of 158). None of the 24 non-ICU patients died. The ICU mortality rate was 53% (9 of 17). CONCLUSIONS This report describes a community hospital experience with COVID-19. Patient outcome was comparable to that reported at larger centers. Obesity was a major comorbidity and correlated with adverse outcomes. Amidst the initial wave of COVID-19 with high demand for inpatient treatment, it is reassuring that appropriate care can be provided in a community health system.","output":"COVID-19 in a Mississippi Community Hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet of Things (IoT) and smart medical devices have improved the healthcare systems by enabling remote monitoring and screening of the patients health conditions anywhere and anytime. Due to an unexpected and huge increasing in number of patients during coronavirus (novel COVID-19) pandemic, it is considerably indispensable to monitor patients health condition continuously before any serious disorder or infection occur. According to transferring the huge volume of produced sensitive health data of patients who do not want their private medical information to be revealed, dealing with security issues of IoT data as a major concern and a challenging problem has remained yet. Encountering this challenge, in this paper, a remote health monitoring model that applies a lightweight block encryption method for provisioning security for health and medical data in cloud-based IoT environment is presented. In this model, the patients health statuses are determined via predicting critical situations through data mining methods for analyzing their biological data sensed by smart medical IoT devices in which a lightweight secure block encryption technique is used to ensure the patients sensitive data become protected. Lightweight block encryption methods have a crucial effective influence on this sort of systems due to the restricted resources in IoT platforms. Experimental outcomes show that K-star classification method achieves the best results among RF, MLP, SVM, and J48 classifiers, with accuracy of 95%, precision of 94.5%, recall of 93.5%, and f-score of 93.99%.

Although respiratory symptoms are a key feature of the disease, many people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 also suffer acute kidney injury, a condition that exacerbates patient mortality and may have to be treated through renal replacement therapy. Much of the focus on hospital capacity during the pandemic has centered on the availability of ventilators. However, supplies for dialysis treatment, including dialysate, have also run dangerously low in hospitals at the epicenter of the pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop materials that can efficiently and rapidly regenerate dialysate, removing toxins and restoring electrolyte concentrations so that this vital resource remains readily available. In this work, Ti3C2Tx, a two-dimensional transition-metal carbide (MXene) that is known to efficiently adsorb urea, was used to remove creatinine and uric acid from an aqueous solution and dialysate, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 45.7 and 17.0 mg/g, respectively. We systematically analyzed and modeled the adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics, thus determining the rate-limiting step and adsorption mechanism. A fixed-bed column loaded with Ti3C2Tx was designed to further evaluate the adsorption performance under continuous fluid-flow conditions, mirroring conditions of continuous renal replacement therapy modalities. The maximum capacity and 50% breakthrough volume were calculated to further approach the practical application of Ti3C2Tx for removal of uremic toxins. Our findings suggest that Ti3C2Tx has the potential to be used as an efficient sorbent for the regeneration of dialysate, allowing for accelerated dialysate regeneration by removing filtered toxins and leading to more portable dialysis devices.","output":"Adsorption of Uremic Toxins Using Ti3C2Tx MXene for Dialysate Regeneration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Different indices have been devised that attempt to correlate the severity of the symptoms and predict mortality mainly in septic states and inflammation, with important results that validate their usefulness.

The primary aim was to perform a critical analysis of duration of convalescence from work and activity and secondary to identify risk factors for unexpected prolonged convalescence after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A qualitative systematic review was conducted. PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane database were searched for trials reporting convalescence after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in the period from January 1990 to January 2016. Furthermore, snowball search was performed in reference lists of identified articles. Randomized controlled trials and prospective comparative or non-comparative trials of high quality were included. Trials with 100 patients, >18 years of age and manuscripts in English were included. Scoring systems were used for assessment of quality. RESULTS The literature search identified 1039 papers. Thirty-four trials were included in the final review including 14,273 patients. There was overall a large variation in duration of convalescence. Trials using non-restrictive recommendations of 1-2 days or \\"as soon as possible to return to all activities\\" reported overall a shorter duration of convalescence compared with trials not using recommendations for convalescence. Strenuous physical activity at work, strenuous leisure activity and patients with expectations of a prolonged period of convalescence may be risk factors for prolonged convalescence extending more than a few days after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. CONCLUSIONS Patients should be recommended a duration of 1-2 days of convalescence after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

Organic public conversations on Twitter about quitting smoking could provide insight into quitting motivations or behaviors associated with the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study explored key topics of conversation about quitting cigarette smoking and examined their trajectory during 2018-2020. METHODS: Topic model analysis with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) identified themes in US tweets with the term quit smoking. The model was trained on posts from 2018 and was then applied to tweets posted in 2019 and 2020. Analysis of variance and follow-up pairwise tests were used to compare the daily frequency of tweets within and across years by quarter. RESULTS: The mean numbers of daily tweets on quitting smoking in 2018, 2019, and 2020 were 133 (SD 36.2), 145 (SD 69.4), and 127 (SD 32.6), respectively. Six topics were extracted: (1) need to quit, (2) personal experiences, (3) electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), (4) advice/success, (5) quitting as a component of general health behavior change, and (6) clinics/services. Overall, the pandemic was not associated with changes in posts about quitting; instead, New Years resolutions and the 2019 e-cigarette or vaping useCassociated lung injury (EVALI) epidemic were more plausible explanations for observed changes within and across years. Fewer second-quarter posts in 2020 for the topic e-cigarettes may reflect lower pandemic-related quitting interest, whereas fourth-quarter increases in 2020 for other topics pointed to a late-year upswing. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter posts suggest that the pandemic did not generate greater interest in quitting smoking, but possibly a decrease in motivation when the rate of infections was increasing in the second quarter of 2020.

The majority of these studies employed a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and CBPR studies included CHWs as research partners in more phases of research relative to non-CBPR studies. This scoping review documents specific benefits from the inclusion of CHWs as partners in health intervention research and identifies strategies to engage CHWs as research partners and to ensure that CHW contributions to research are well-documented.","output":"Positionality of Community Health Workers on Health Intervention Research Teams: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Model checking algorithms are typically complex graph algorithms, whose correctness is crucial for the usability of a model checker. However, establishing the correctness of such algorithms can be challenging and is often done manually. Mechanising the verification process is crucially important, because model checking algorithms are often parallelised for efficiency reasons, which makes them even more error-prone. This paper shows how the VerCors concurrency verifier is used to mechanically verify the parallel nested depth-first search (NDFS) graph algorithm of Laarman et al. [25]. We also demonstrate how having a mechanised proof supports the easy verification of various optimisations of parallel NDFS.

In response to these recommendations the need for a revised childrens palliative care competency framework was recognized. A Childrens Palliative Care Education and Training Action Group, comprising champions in the field, was formed across UK and Ireland in 2019 to take this work forward. Their aim was to agree core principles of practice in order to standardize childrens palliative care education and training. METHODS: Over four meetings the Action Group reviewed sources of evidence and guidance including palliative care competency documents and UK and Ireland quality and qualification frameworks. Expected levels of developing knowledge and skills were then agreed and identified competencies mapped to each level. The mapping process led to the development of learning outcomes, local indicative programme content and assessment exemplars. RESULTS: Four sections depicting developing levels of knowledge and skills were identified: Public Health, Universal, Core, Specialist. Each level has four learning outcomes: Communicating effectively, Working with others in and across various settings, Identifying and managing symptoms, Sustaining self-care and supporting the well-being of others. An audit tool template was developed to facilitate quality assurance of programme delivery. The framework and audit tool repository is on the International Childrens Palliative Care Network website for ease of international access. CONCLUSIONS: The framework has received interest at UK, Ireland and International launches. While there are education programmes in childrens palliative care this is the first international attempt to coordinate education, to address lay carer education and to include public health.","output":"Childrens palliative care education and training: developing an education standard framework and audit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The general public is familiar with the physical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and takes the required precautions to minimize coronavirus exposure and manage COVID-19 symptoms if they develop.

SETTING: A large London teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three groups were compared: group 1-COVID-19-associated deaths in the 6-week period (n=243), group 2-non-COVID deaths in the same period (n=136) and group 3-all deaths in a comparison period of the same 6 weeks in 2019 (n=194). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: This was a descriptive analysis of death case series review and as such no primary or secondary outcomes were pre-stipulated. RESULTS: Deaths in patients from the Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities in the pandemic period significantly increased both in the COVID-19 group (OR=2.43, 95% CI=1.60-3.68, p<0.001) and the non-COVID group (OR=1.76, 95% CI=1.09-2.83, p=0.02) during this time period and the increase was independent of differences in comorbidities, sex, age or deprivation. While the absolute number of deaths increased in 2020 compared with 2019, across all three groups the distribution of deaths by age was very similar. Our analyses confirm major risk factors for COVID-19 mortality including male sex, diabetes, having multiple comorbidities and background from the BAME communities. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of COVID-19 deaths occurring disproportionately in the elderly compared with non-COVID deaths in this period in 2020 and 2019. Deaths in the BAME communities were over-represented in both COVID-19 and non-COVID groups, highlighting the need for detailed research in order to fully understand the influence of ethnicity on susceptibility to illness, mortality and health-seeking behaviour during the pandemic.","output":"Deaths in people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities from both COVID-19 and non-COVID causes in the first weeks of the pandemic in London: a hospital case note review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This paper introduces DynamoVis version 1.0, an open-source software developed to design, record and export custom animations and multivariate visualizations from movement data, enabling visual exploration and communication of patterns capturing the associations between animals movement and its affecting internal and external factors.

Loss of smell and taste have emerged as main predictors for COVID-19. The objective of our study is to develop a comprehensive machine learning (ML) modelling framework to assess the predictive value of smell and taste disorders, along with other symptoms, in COVID-19 infection. A multicenter case-control study was performed, in which suspected cases for COVID-19, who were tested by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), informed about the presence and severity of their symptoms using visual analog scales (VAS). ML algorithms were applied to the collected data to predict a COVID-19 diagnosis using a 50-fold cross-validation scheme by randomly splitting the patients in training (75%) and testing datasets (25%). A total of 777 patients were included. Loss of smell and taste were found to be the symptoms with higher odds ratios of 6.21 and 2.42 for COVID-19 positivity. The ML algorithms applied reached an average accuracy of 80%, a sensitivity of 82%, and a specificity of 78% when using VAS to predict a COVID-19 diagnosis.

A multi-center study recruited patients with T1D using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) between January 2019 and January 2020 from centers across Italy. Diet intake was recorded using three-day weighed food diaries. Nutrients were evaluated as percentages of total intake. TIR was considered at target if the percentage of readings was higher than 70%. Clinical and nutritional factors associated with TIR at target were analyzed using multiple correspondence analysis and multiple logistic regression. Data from 197 participants (53% male, median age 11.6 years, median HbA1c 55.2 mmol/mol, median TIR 60%) were analyzed. Macronutrient intake was 45.9% carbohydrates, 16.9% protein, 37.3% fat, and 13.1 g/day fiber (median values). TIR > 70% was observed in 28% of participants; their diet contained more protein (17.6%, p = 0.015) and fiber (14.4 g/day, p = 0.031) than those not at target. The probability of having a TIR > 70% was significantly higher with 40C44% consumption of carbohydrates compared with 45C50% consumption of carbohydrates and with the use of a carbohydrate counting system. Based on these results, a five percent reduction in the percentage of carbohydrate intake can help children and adolescents with T1D achieve the goal of a TIR > 70%. Both a lower and higher percentage of carbohydrate intake appears to reduce the probability of reaching the target TIR > 70%.

Although vaccines are usually cost-effective, their adoption depends on a multitude of factors. Because poultry vaccines are usually given to birds with a short life span, very low production cost per dose is one important challenge. Other hurdles are to ensure a consistent and reliable supply of very large number of doses, and to have flexible production processes to accommodate a range of different pathogens and dosage requirements. Most poultry vaccines are currently being produced on primary avian cells derived from chicken or waterfowl embryos. This production system is associated with high costs, logistic complexities, rigid intervals between harvest and production, and supply limitations. We investigated whether the continuous cell lines Cairina retina and CR.pIX may provide a substrate independent of primary cell cultures or embryonated eggs. Viruses examined for replication in these cell lines are strains associated with, or contained in vaccines against egg drop syndrome, Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, avian influenza, infectious bursal disease and Derzsy's disease.

METHODS: We formed an interprofessional, multidisciplinary team as part of the ASCO Quality Training Program. We obtained data from the electronic medical record and verified data with patients by phone. We surveyed patients, oncologists, and fertility specialists to identify barriers. After considering a prioritization matrix, we implemented Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. RESULTS: We identified the following improvement opportunities: (1) oncologist self-reported lack of knowledge about counseling and local fertility preservation options and (2) lack of a standardized referral mechanism to fertility services. During the first PDSA cycle (February 2020-August 2020, disrupted by COVID-19), we introduced the initiative to increase oncofertility counseling at faculty meetings. From September 2020 to November 2020, we implemented a second PDSA cycle: (1) educating and presenting the initiative at Oncology Grand Rounds, (2) distributing informative pamphlets to oncologists and patients, and (3) implementing an electronic medical record order set. In the third PDSA cycle (December 2020-February 2021), we redesigned the order set to add information (eg, contact information for fertility coordinator) to the patient after-visit summary.

This epidemiological review explores the urbanization-Internet addiction association and its potential underlying factors. RECENT FINDINGS Nine studies have reported that Internet addiction prevalence is higher in urban areas, but three studies have noted the opposite. Psychiatric disorders and stress are the most commonly mentioned factors underlying the association. The effects of urbanization on Internet availability, Internet cafs, online gaming, outdoor or interactive activities, and family regulation and monitoring have been suggested to lead to higher Internet addiction risk. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, obesity, sleep problems, and the migration of parents to urban areas in search of work have strengthened the effect of urbanization on Internet addiction. SUMMARY Early assessment and treatment provided by mental health services are crucial for mitigating the effect of urbanization on Internet addiction risk. Cities should be designed to provide adequate space for physical and interactive activities. To promote outdoor activities, air pollution, traffic congestion, and crime should be controlled.

In the prospective regression models, young adults who experienced recent eviction had more depressive symptoms and worse self-rated health than those who were not evicted, net a host of background characteristics. Using treatment weighting techniques, results showed that young adults who experienced eviction had more depressive symptoms than those who were not evicted (5.921 vs. 4.998 depressive symptoms, p = 0.003). Perceived social stress mediated nearly 18 percent of the associations between eviction and the depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). In the first difference models, young people who experienced eviction between survey waves experienced greater increases in depressive symptoms over time compared to those who were not evicted, net of changes in other indicators of socioeconomic status and residential instability. Taken together, our results suggest that the recent surges in evictions in the U.S. serve as a potent threat to population health during the emerging adult period, with especially devastating consequences for low-income individuals and communities of color.","output":"The health impacts of eviction: Evidence from the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that cases of Kawasaki disease within a temporal cluster have a similar pattern of host response that is distinct from cases of Kawasaki disease in different observed clusters and randomly constructed clusters. STUDY DESIGN: We designed a case-control study to analyze 47 clusters derived from 1332 patients with Kawasaki disease over a 17-yr. period (2002-2019) from a single clinical site and compared the cluster characteristics with two control groups of synthetic KD clusters. We defined a true KD cluster as at least 5 patients within a 7-day moving window. The observed and synthetic KD clusters were compared with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics and median values for standard laboratory data using univariate analysis and a multivariate, Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis (REOFs). RESULTS: In a univariate analysis, the median values for age, coronary artery Z score, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and age-adjusted hemoglobin for several of the true KD clusters exceeded the 95th percentile for the two synthetic clusters. REOFs revealed distinct patterns of demographic and clinical measures within clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of Kawasaki disease within a cluster were more similar with respect to demographic and clinical features, and levels of inflammation than would be expected by chance. These observations suggest that different triggers and/or different intensity of exposures result in clusters of cases of Kawasaki disease that share a similar response pattern. Analyzing cases within clusters or cases who share demographic and clinical features may lead to new insights into the etiology of KD.","output":"Temporal Clusters of Kawasaki Disease Cases Share Distinct Phenotypes That Suggest Response to Diverse Triggers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of atypical pneumonia termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since the beginning of 2020. It poses a significant threat to the global health and the economy. Physicians face ambiguity in their decision-making for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. In this respect, designing an intelligent system for early diagnosis of the disease is critical for mitigating virus spread and resource optimization. This study aimed to establish an artificial neural network (ANNs)-based clinical model to diagnose COVID-19. The retrospective dataset used in this study consisted of 400 COVID-19 case records (250 positives vs. 150 negatives) and 18 columns for the diagnostic features. The backpropagation technique was used to train a neural network. After designing multiple neural network configurations, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values were calculated to measure the model performance. The two nested loops architecture of 9-10-15-2 (10 and 15 neurons used in layer one and layer two, respectively) with the ROC of 98.2%, sensitivity of 96.4%, specificity of 90.6%, and accuracy of 94 % were introduced as the best configuration model for COVID-19 diagnosis. ANN is valuable as a decision-support tool for clinicians to improve the COVID-19 diagnosis. It is promising to implement the ANN model to improve the accuracy and speed of the COVID-19 diagnosis for timely screening, treatment, and careful monitoring.

A third virus, the H5N1, responsible for avian influenza, has caused infection with some clinical similarities to those in COVID-19 infections. Cytokines, small proteins that modulate immune responses, have been directly implicated in some of the severe responses seen in COVID-19 patients, e.g. cytokine storms. Understanding the immune processes related to COVID-19, and other similar infections, could help identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Here we examine data of cytokine, immune cell types, and disease associations captured from biomedical literature associated with coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1 influenza, with the objective of identifying potentially useful relationships and areas for future research. Cytokine and cell-type associations captured from MeSH terms linked to thousands of PubMed abstracts, has identified differing patterns of associations between the three corpuses of abstracts (coronavirus, SARS, or H5N1 influenza). Clustering of cytokine-disease co-occurrences in the context of coronavirus has identified compelling clusters of co-morbidities and symptoms, some of which already known to be linked to COVID-19. Finally, network analysis identified sub-networks of cytokines and immune cell types associated with different manifestations, co-morbidities and symptoms of coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1. Systematic review of research in medicine is essential to facilitate evidence-based choices about health interventions.

METHODS In this pilot study, 10 sexually mature ewes were subjected to laparotomy and total abdominal hysterectomy with oophorectomy to procure uterus allografts. The cold ischemic time was 60 min. End-to-end vascular anastomosis was performed using continuous, non-interlocking sutures. Complete tissue reperfusion was achieved in all animals within 30 s after the vascular re-anastomosis, without any evidence of arterial or venous thrombosis. The immunosuppressive protocol consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone tablets. Graft viability was assessed by transrectal ultrasonography and second-look laparotomy at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. RESULTS Viable uterine tissue and vascular patency were observed on transrectal ultrasonography and second-look laparotomy. Histological analysis of the graft tissue (performed in one ewe) revealed normal tissue architecture with a very subtle inflammatory reaction but no edema or stasis.

The defences for this type of attack are usually activated after the end-user clicks on a link, at which point the link is checked. This is known as after-the-click detection. However, more sophisticated phishing attacks (such as spear-phishing and whaling) are rarely designed to get the end-user to visit a website. Instead, they attempt to get the end-user to perform some other action, for example, transferring money from their bank account to the mal-actors account. These attacks are rarer, and before-the-click defence has been investigated less than after-the-click defence. To better integrate and contextualize these studies in the overall anti-phishing research, this paper presents a systematic literature review of proposed anti-phishing defences.

Timely identification of these patients is crucial for a proper administration of health-care resources. OBJECTIVE: To develop a predictive score that estimates the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) among patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of 401 COVID-19 patients diagnosed from March 12, to August 10, 2020. The score development cohort comprised 211 patients (52.62% of total sample) whereas the validation cohort included 190 patients (47.38% of total sample). We divided participants according to the need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and looked for potential predictive variables. RESULTS: We developed two predictive scores, one based on Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the other one on the Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), using the following variables: respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2 ratio and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The area under the curve (AUC) in the development cohort was 0.877 (0.823-0.931) using the NLR based score and 0.891 (0.843-0.939) using the IL-6 based score. When compared with other similar scores developed for the prediction of adverse outcomes in COVID-19, the COVID-IRS scores proved to be superior in the prediction of IMV. CONCLUSION: The COVID-IRS scores accurately predict the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients using readily available variables taken upon admission.

The underlying mechanism on SAON was evaluated using a well-established quadrupedal rabbit model. Fifteen emus were established with SAON, and CD was performed along the femoral neck for the efficacy study. In this CD bone defect, a P/T scaffold with icaritin (P/T/I group) or without icaritin (P/T group) was implanted while no scaffold implantation was used as a control. For the mechanistic study in rabbits, the effects of icaritin and composite scaffolds on bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) recruitment, osteogenesis, and anti-adipogenesis were evaluated. Our efficacy study showed that P/T/I group had the significantly lowest incidence of femoral head collapse, better preserved cartilage and mechanical properties supported by more new bone formation within the bone tunnel.

Imaging was reviewed for each procedure to identify MWA showing transpleural transgression on CT scans. For these patients, demographics, ablation data, pulmonary complication rate, and predictors of pneumothorax were analyzed. Results A total of 71 consecutive sessions (62.1  11.3 years, 79% of males) of MWA were performed to treat 71 tumors (1.90  0.96 cm) via transpulmonary approach under CT guidance. Technical success was achieved in all cases immediately after the procedure. At 1-month follow-up, 65/69 (94.2%) patients had no residual disease (two patients were lost to follow-up). Pulmonary complications occurred in 26/71 (36.6%) sessions, and 15/26 (57.7%) were minor requiring no intervention. Pneumothorax occurred in 14/71 (19.7%) sessions, and the rate of major pneumothorax requiring chest tube was 8/71 (11.3%).

There are no comparative studies that identify the most effective medication for pain reduction in CSPN. Objective To determine which medication (pregabalin, duloxetine, nortriptyline, or mexiletine) is most effective for reducing neuropathic pain and best tolerated in patients with CSPN. Design, Setting, and Participants From December 1, 2014, through October 20, 2017, a bayesian adaptive, open-label randomized clinical comparative effectiveness study of pain in 402 participants with CSPN was conducted at 40 neurology care clinics.

Participants were patients with CSPN who were 30 years or older, with a pain score of 4 or greater on a numerical rating scale (range, 0-10, with higher scores indicating a higher level of pain). Participant allocation to 1 of 4 drug groups used the utility function and treatment's sample size for response adaptation randomization. At each interim analysis, a decision was made to continue enrolling (up to 400 participants) or stop the whole trial for success (80% power).

Results Among the 402 participants (213 men [53.0%]; mean [SD] age, 60.1 [13.4] years; 343 White [85.3%]), the utility function of nortriptyline was 0.81 (95% bayesian credible interval [CrI], 0.69-0.93; 34 of 134 [25.4%] efficacious; and 51 of 134 [38.1%] quit), of duloxetine was 0.80 (95% CrI, 0.68-0.92; 29 of 126 [23.0%] efficacious; and 47 of 126 [37.3%] quit), pregabalin was 0.69 (95% CrI, 0.55-0.84; 11 of 73 [15.1%] efficacious; and 31 of 73 [42.5%] quit), and mexiletine was 0.58 (95% CrI, 0.42-0.75; 14 of 69 [20.3%] efficacious; and 40 of 69 [58.0%] quit). The probability each medication yielded the highest utility was 0.52 for nortriptyline, 0.43 for duloxetine, 0.05 for pregabalin, and 0.00 for mexiletine. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that, although there was no clearly superior medication, nortriptyline and duloxetine outperformed pregabalin and mexiletine when pain reduction and undesirable adverse effects are combined to a single end point.

Few studies have examined the relationship between unmet social needs and diabetes control among predominantly Black and Hispanic patient populations. METHODS: In a large urban hospital system in the Bronx, NY, 5846 unique patients with diabetes seen at a primary care visit between April 2018 and December 2019 completed a social needs screener. Measures included diabetes control (categorized as Hemoglobin (Hb) A1c <9.0 as controlled and Hb A1C 9.0 as uncontrolled), social needs (10-item screen), and demographic covariates, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, percentage of block-group poverty, patients preferred language, and the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent (22%) of the patient sample had at least 1 unmet social need, and the most prevalent unmet social needs were housing issues (including housing quality and insecurity), food insecurity, and lack of healthcare transportation. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant relationship between social needs and uncontrolled diabetes, with more social needs indicating a greater likelihood of uncontrolled diabetes (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) for 3 needs: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.00). Of the patients with most frequently occurring unmet social needs, lack of healthcare transportation (AOR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.95) and food insecurity (AOR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.89) had the greatest likelihood of having uncontrolled diabetes, after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION: Unmet social needs appear to be linked to a greater likelihood of uncontrolled diabetes.

We based our study on an analysis of 34 in-depth semistructured interviews with teachers of the Faculty of Arts at Masaryk University, in which these teachers reflected on their approaches to online distance teaching during the COVID-19pandemic. We show that the way the teachers approached the teaching was strongly linked with their conception of teaching and the way they construct the concept of good higher education. According to the analysis of the interviews, we distinguish two polar types of teachers. The first type are functionalists, who focus on passing on knowledge and skills to students. During the pandemic, usingjudicious pedagogical analysis, they strove to best replace the various components of face-to-face teaching with digital tools and applications. They believe that quality online teaching is challenging, but feasible andpotentially bringing new features to higher education. The second type identified were authenticators, who understand teaching as a creation of knowledge and skills in the process of authentic communication between teacher and students. These teachers believe that online tools do not make itpossible to adequately replace face-to face classes andperceive the transition to distance learning as a major threat to quality and to the mission of higher education in general.","output":"Vyzva, Nebo Nemo?n Mise?

In Australia, the pandemic has radically influenced the mobilities of domestic tourists, with travellers subjected to dynamic and intermittent restrictions on both intrastate and interstate movement since March, 2020. This paper reports on the findings of a study conducted between June and July 2020 that explored Australians intentions to participate in tourism as COVID-19 leisure travel restrictions eased. It reveals that the participants sought to shift from modes of transport that involve high risks of exposure to other tourists, including cruise ships and air travel, to private, smaller-scale forms of leisure mobility such as cars and campervans. The paper draws from this trend to offer recommendations that champion both the experiential qualities of tourist automobilities and the positioning of private vehicles as temporary facilitators of safer mobilities that may also support wellbeing. These recommendations are afforded additional significance by the opportunities they imply for the stimulation of regional tourism economies severely affected by the unstable and volatile mobilities of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Thus, a search for modalities that can expedite and improve the diagnosis and management of this entity is underway. Recent data suggested the utility of lung ultrasound (LUS) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 by detecting an interstitial pattern (B-pattern). Hence, we aimed to pool the proportion of various reported lung abnormalities detected by LUS in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. We conducted a systematic review (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE until April 25, 2020) and a proportion meta-analysis. We included seven studies examining the role of LUS in 122 COVID-19 patients. The pooled proportion (PP) of B-pattern detected by lung ultrasound (US) was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00 I 2 0%, Q 4.6). The PP of finding pleural line abnormalities was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.13-1.00 I 2 96%, Q 103.9), of pleural thickening was 0.54 (95% 0.11-0.95 I 2 93%, Q 61.1), of subpleural or pulmonary consolidation was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21-0.58 I 2 72%, Q 17.8), and of pleural effusion was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.00-0.37 I 2 93%, Q 27.3). Our meta-analysis revealed that almost all SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have abnormal lung US. The most common abnormality is interstitial involvement depicted as B-pattern. The finding from our review highlights the potential role of this modality in the triage, diagnosis, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. A sizable diagnostic accuracy study comparing LUS, computed tomography scan, and COVID-19-specific tests is warranted to further test this finding and to delineate the diagnostic and prognostic yield of each of these modalities.","output":"Frequency of Abnormalities Detected by Point-of-Care Lung Ultrasound in Symptomatic COVID-19 Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific humoral immune persistence has been proposed to be affected by patients characteristics. Moreover, available conflicting assay results are needed to be settled through comparative research with defined clinical specimens. Methods This prospective study investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies among 43 adults and 34 children at a mean of 12 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms using six serological assays and compared their performance. We used two Euroimmun (Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany), two automated Roche Elecsys (Basel, Switzerland), and two rapid immuno-chromatographic Ecotest (Matrix Diagnostics, Assure Tech. (Hangzhou) Co., L, China) assays to investigate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results The findings showed that the Roche Elecsys anti-S total test yielded the best positivity/sensitivity (children 94.1% and adults 93.0%; p = 0.877) while five immunoglobulin IgG targeting assays had similar positivity/sensitivity between children (88.2% to 94.1%) and adults (88.4% to 93.0%) (p > 0.05). Although IgM positivity was relatively low (p < 0.001), it was found in the majority of our pediatric and adult patients (67.6% and 86.0%, respectively; p = 0.098). SARS-CoV-2 S IgG titers were found to be higher among males in pediatric and adult groups compared to females (p = 0.027 and p = 0.041, respectively). Furthermore, we observed significantly higher antibody titers among pneumonia patients (p = 0.001). Conclusion Overall, we concluded SARS-CoV-2 antibody persistence over an average of 12 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. While automated Roche Elecsys total antibody assays yielded the best sensitivity (> 90%) and five assays targeting IgG had acceptable performance. Patients with pneumonia and males have higher antibody titers.

However, the fermentation batch process using these bacteria present some bioprocess limitations due to strong end-product inhibition, cells slow-growing rates, low product titer, yields and productivities, which reduces the bioprocess prospects for industrial applications. The high cell density culture (HCDC) bioprocess system is known as an efficient approach to overcome most of those problems.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to characterize a large cohort of COVID-19-positive adult patients with AD and to identify predictors of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: A population-based nested case-control study was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of predictors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: Of 78,073 adult patients with AD, 3618 (4.6%) tested positive for COVID-19. Subclinical COVID-19 infection occurred in 3368 (93.1%) of COVID-19-positive patients, whereas 123 (3.4%), 46 (1.3%), 55 (1.5%), and 26 (0.7%) patients developed a mild, moderate, severe, and critical disease, respectively. Altogether, 250 patients (6.0%) were hospitalized, and 40 patients (1.1%) died because of COVID-19 complications.

Given prior quality concerns about antibiotic management for children during telemedicine visits outside of primary care, we sought to examine acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) visit volume and antibiotic management for children via telemedicine integrated within pediatric primary care. METHODS: Using electronic health record data from 47 practices within a large pediatric primary care network, we identified visits for ARTI from April to September 2020. For these visits, we categorized antibiotic management consistent with clinical guidelines as guideline concordant. We compared telemedicine and in-person visit guideline-concordant antibiotic management, diagnoses, and antibiotic prescribing using chi-square tests and examined trends over time using descriptive statistics. Antibiotic stewardship during the study period included learning collaborative videoconferences and sharing of clinic and clinician-level metrics through an interactive dashboard. RESULTS: During the 6-month period, 8332 ARTI visits were identified, with 3003 (36%) via telemedicine. Guideline-concordant antibiotic management occurred in 92.5% of telemedicine visits compared to 90.7% of in-person office visits (P = .004). Telemedicine ARTI visits receiving diagnoses of acute otitis media or streptococcal pharyngitis declined from peak of 52% (May) to 7% (September). Guideline-concordant antibiotic management of sinusitis and viral ARTI during telemedicine visits increased from 88% (April) to 97% (September).

There is correspondingly less data regarding pediatric radiologic findings. To describe the imaging findings of pediatric COVID-19, we evaluated the radiologic imaging of the initial patient cohort identified at our institution. METHODS: In this IRB approved study, all patients at our institution aged 0-21 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on PCR or immunoglobulin testing were identified. Imaging was reviewed by the co-authors and presence of abnormalities determined by consensus. Pre-existing comorbidities and alternative diagnoses were recorded. Rates of each finding were calculated. Findings were compared to published data following review of the available literature. RESULTS: Out of 130 Covid-19 positive patients, 24 patients underwent imaging, including 21 chest radiographs and 4 chest CT scans. Chest x-rays were normal in 33%.

Matching for age, sex, number of comorbidities and hospital was performed to select the patients without hypothyroidism for the paired analysis. ResultsFrom 7,762 COVID-19 patients, 526 had previously diagnosed hypothyroidism (50%) and 526 were selected as matched controls. The median age was 70 (interquartile range 59.0-80.0) years-old and 68.3% were females. The prevalence of underlying comorbidities were similar between groups, except for coronary and chronic kidney diseases, that had a higher prevalence in the hypothyroidism group (9.7% vs. 5.7%, p=0.015 and 9.9% vs. 4.8%, p=0.001, respectively). At hospital presentation, patients with hypothyroidism had a lower frequency of respiratory rate > 24 breaths per minute (36.1% vs 42.0%; p=0.050) and need of mechanical ventilation (4.0% vs 7.4%; p=0.016). D-dimer levels were slightly lower in hypothyroid patients (2.3 times higher than the reference value vs 2.9 times higher; p=0.037). In-hospital management was similar between groups, but hospital length-of-stay (8 vs 9 days; p=0.029) and mechanical ventilation requirement (25.4% vs. 33.1%; p=0.006) were lower for patients with hypothyroidism.

Therefore, hypothyroidism does not seem to be associated with a worse prognosis, and should not be considered among the comorbidities that indicate a risk factor for COVID-19 severity.","output":"Hypothyroidism does not lead to worse prognosis in COVID-19: findings from the Brazilian COVID-19 registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present a Decomposition Coordination (DC) method applied to solve the problem of safe trajectory planning for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a dynamic environment. The purpose of this study is to make the UAV more reactive in the environment and ensure the safety and optimality of the computed trajectory. In this implementation, we begin by selecting a dynamic model of a fixed-arms quadrotor UAV. Then, we define our multi-objective optimization problem, which we convert afterward into a scalar optimization problem (SOP). The SOP is subdivided after that into smaller sub-problems, which will be treated in parallel and in a reasonable time. The DC principle employed in our method allows us to treat non-linearity at the local level. The coordination between the two levels is achieved after that through the Lagrange multipliers. Making use of the DC method, we can compute the optimal trajectory from the UAVs current position to a final target practically in real-time. In this approach, we suppose that the environment is totally supervised by a Ground Control Unit (GCU). To ensure the safety of the trajectory, we consider a wireless communication network over which the UAV may communicate with the GCU and get the necessary information about environmental changes, allowing for successful collision avoidance during the flight until the intended goal is safely attained. The analysis of the DC algorithms stability and convergence, as well as the simulation results, are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our method and validate its potential.","output":"Effective and Safe Trajectory Planning for an Autonomous UAV Using a Decomposition-Coordination Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a growing recommendation for social distancing and using personal protective equipment (PPE) to help mitigate the virus transmission.

In this longitudinal study, the variables were measured across a two-month interval during the earlier phase of the pandemic in June (Time 1) and August (Time 2), 2020. The results from 151 matched USA MTurk participants indicated that the perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 did not significantly predict the health protective behaviors.

The study aimed to study the nature of religious coping of frontline healthcare workers seen through the perspective of gender, socio-economic status, and occupation. Methods: An online-based study was carried out among frontline healthcare workers involved in the care of COVID-19 patients (n = 200). Sociodemographic data form and the Brief Religious Coping scale were used in this study. Results: There were more female healthcare workers (60.5%) and doctors (69.5% vs. 30.5%). Healthcare workers used more positive religious coping than negative religious coping (median score: 22 vs. 9). Positive religious coping was seen more in females (median score: 23 vs. 21, P = .015). Non-doctors applied positive coping more than doctors (median score: 26 vs. 21, P &lt; .001). There were significant differences in positive religious coping scores across income groups, with the B40 group having the highest score (median score: 24). Post hoc pairwise comparison concluded that the B40 group had significantly higher positive religious coping scores than the M40 group. Conclusion: Positive coping was utilized more among female healthcare workers, nondoctors, and the lowest socio-economic group. As prior literature has shown that positive religious coping is desirable and has superior mental health outcomes, our findings show that more effort should be channeled into enhancing positive religious coping, particularly among male healthcare workers, doctors, and the middle and high socio-economic group.

The objectives were to examine the extent to which mental health symptoms changed during the pandemic in 2020, whether changes were persistent or short lived, and if changes were symptom specific. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies examining changes in mental health among the same group of participants before vs. during the pandemic in 2020. RESULTS: Sixty-five studies were included. Compared to pre-pandemic outbreak, there was an overall increase in mental health symptoms observed during March-April 2020 (SMC = .102 [95% CI: .026 to .192]) that significantly declined over time and became non-significant (May-July SMC = .067 [95% CI: -.022 to .157]. Compared to measures of anxiety (SMC = 0.13, p = 0.02) and general mental health (SMC = -.03, p = 0.65), increases in depression and mood disorder symptoms tended to be larger and remained significantly elevated in May-July [0.20, 95% CI: .099 to .302]. In primary analyses increases were most pronounced among samples with physical health conditions and there was no evidence of any change in symptoms among samples with a pre-existing mental health condition. LIMITATIONS: There was a high degree of unexplained heterogeneity observed (I(2)s > 90%), indicating that change in mental health was highly variable across samples. CONCLUSIONS: There was a small increase in mental health symptoms soon after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that decreased and was comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020 among most population sub-groups and symptom types.","output":"A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies comparing mental health before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Hajj pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of Islam, is held in Saudi Arabia in the second week of Dhu'l-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar.

However, Until now, the role of RIPK4 in tumorigenesis remains elusive. There have been no studies exploring the effects of RIPK4 on the signaling pathway in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). It remains unknown whether RIPK4 expression, which can affect the degree of epidermal differentiation can also influence the radiosensitivity of skin SCC. It is urgent to fully elucidate the biological mechanism by which RIPK4 promotes carcinogenesis in skin SCC and determine whether RIPK4 expression levels predicts the sensitivity to radiotherapy in skin SCC. Methods: Human skin SCC cell line, A431, was transfected with either small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting RIPK4 (siR-RIPK4) or negative control siRNA (siR-NC). Western blotting was used to detect the expression of RIPK4 and Raf/MEK/ERK pathway-related proteins. The cells were irradiated using an X-ray irradiator at 6 MV with different radiation doses (0, 2, 6, and 10 Gy). Cell proliferation analysis, colony formation assay, transwell cell migration and invasion assay, cell cycle and apoptosis analysis were conducted to investigate the effect of RIPK4 silencing on skin SCC malignancy and radiosensitivity. Results: RIPK4 protein expression was significantly decreased in the A431 cells transfected with siR-RIPK4, compared with the A431 cells transfected with siR-NC. RIPK4 silencing facilitated the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion ability of A431 cell line, while cell cycle progression or cell apoptosis were not significantly influenced. In contrast with the previous literature, Raf/MEK/ERK pathway was not effected by RIPK4 knockdown in skin SCC. RIPK4 knockdown could not reverse the radiation resistance of A431 cells to irradiation in vitro. Conclusions: In general, although depletion of RIPK4 cannot reverse the radiation resistance of A431 cells in vitro, it parallels higher malignancy potential in cutaneous SCC. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the effects of RIPK4 expression on the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and radiosensitivity in cutaneous SCC. The better understanding of the molecular mechanism of RIPK4 in cutaneous SCC may provide a promising biomarker for skin SCC prognosis and treatment.","output":"Depletion of RIPK4 parallels higher malignancy potential in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/AimsThe COVID-19 pandemic has created many challenges for patientswith chronic rheumatological diseases. SpA - which includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis(PsA), and enteropathic arthritis - often affects young people who areotherwise fit and able. Many SpA patients take immunosuppressivemedications and therefore were advised to shield. In view of this, weconducted a survey to better understand how shielding has affectedthe physical activity and symptoms of SpA patients during thepandemic.MethodsAn online anonymised survey was created and advertised via socialmedia from 4th June to 4th July 2020. Patients with SpA were invitedto complete the survey which included 18 questions exploring theimpact of the pandemic on their symptoms, physical activity levels andmedication use.ResultsThere were 136 survey respondents, of whom 74.3% were female, with an age range from under 25 to over 75 years. The underlyingdiagnoses were PsA (60.5%), AS (28.4%), axSpA (10.5%) andenteropathic arthritis (0.8%). The majority (66.7%) of respondentswere shielding;44.1% were on disease modifying anti-rheumaticdrugs (csDMARDs) and 56.6% were on biologics (bDMARDs). Most(94.1%) had continued their DMARDs throughout the shielding period.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was reported to beincreased in 18.6% of respondents, and unchanged in 69.0%.Compared to before the pandemic, 54.8% reported worsening jointstiffness and 45.6% reported worsening joint pain.Most respondents (67.6%) reported reduced levels of physical activity, the commonest reasons being: shielding (54.6%);increased fatigue(45.8%);concerns around social distancing (45.4%);poor sleep quality(38.6%);working from home (28.6%) and low mood (28.6%). Only14.7% had attended a virtual exercise class.ConclusionApproximately 2 in 3 patients with SpA reported they were shieldingduring the first wave of the pandemic. Similar numbers of patientsreported reduced physical activity levels and increased joint stiffnessover this time. It is important to acknowledge that given the nature ofthe anonymised survey, we cannot be certain if the same patients whowere shielding were the same as those who had reduced levels ofphysical activity or worsening symptoms. We have, however, shownthat over half of the surveyed patients attributed their reduced physicalactivity levels to shielding. Taking into account that social restrictions(either self-imposed or government advised) are likely to be ongoing, we believe that a focus should be placed on supporting patients tomaintain their activity levels, through initiatives such as specialistvirtual exercise classes.","output":"Results of an online survey exploring theeffects of shielding during the COVID-19 pandemicon patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid (N) protein is a multiphosphorylated protein.It has been proved that the phosphorylation of N protein could regulate the growth ability of PRRSV in Marc-145 cells.

With overwhelming demands on medical resources, patient stratification based on their risks is essential. In this multi-center study, we built prognosis models to predict severity outcomes, combining patients electronic health records (EHR), which included vital signs and laboratory data, with deep learning- and CT-based severity prediction. METHOD: We first developed a CT segmentation network using datasets from multiple institutions worldwide. Two biomarkers were extracted from the CT images : total opacity ratio (TOR) and consolidation ratio (CR). After obtaining TOR and CR, further prognosis analysis was conducted on datasets from INSTITUTE-1, INSTITUTE-2 and INSTITUTE-3. For each data cohort, generalized linear model (GLM) was applied for prognosis prediction. RESULTS: For the deep learning model, the correlation coefficient of the network prediction and manual segmentation was 0.755, 0.919, and 0.824 for the three cohorts, respectively. The AUC (95% CI) of the final prognosis models was 0.85(0.77,0.92), 0.93(0.87,0.98), and 0.86(0.75,0.94) for INSTITUTE-1, INSTITUTE-2 and INSTITUTE-3 cohorts, respectively.

Tumor development and progression are affected by multiple mediators in the tumor microenvironment, several of which may be proteolytically modified by the multifunctional protease dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV, CD26). Currently, low-molecular-weight DPP-IV inhibitors (gliptins) are used in patients with type 2 diabetes based on the observation that DPP-IV inhibition enhances insulin secretion by increasing the bioavailability of incretins. However, the DPP-IV-mediated cleavage of other biopeptides and chemokines is also prevented by gliptins. The potential utility of gliptins in other areas of medicine, including cancer, is therefore being evaluated. Here, we critically review the existing evidence on the role of DPP-IV inhibitors in cancer pathogenesis, their potential to be used in anti-cancer treatment, and the possible perils associated with this approach. ABSTRACT: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV, CD26) is frequently dysregulated in cancer and plays an important role in regulating multiple bioactive peptides with the potential to influence cancer progression and the recruitment of immune cells. Therefore, it represents a potential contributing factor to cancer pathogenesis and an attractive therapeutic target. Specific DPP-IV inhibitors (gliptins) are currently used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to promote insulin secretion by prolonging the activity of the incretins glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Nevertheless, the modulation of the bioavailability and function of other DPP-IV substrates, including chemokines, raises the possibility that the use of these orally administered drugs with favorable side-effect profiles might be extended beyond the treatment of hyperglycemia. In this review, we critically examine the possible utilization of DPP-IV inhibition in cancer prevention and various aspects of cancer treatment and discuss the potential perils associated with the inhibition of DPP-IV in cancer. The current literature is summarized regarding the possible chemopreventive and cytotoxic effects of gliptins and their potential utility in modulating the anti-tumor immune response, enhancing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, preventing acute graft-versus-host disease, and alleviating the side-effects of conventional anti-tumor treatments.","output":"Does DPP-IV Inhibition Offer New Avenues for Therapeutic Intervention in Malignant Disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Available data from observational studies on the association of admission hyperglycaemia (aHG) with outcomes of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) are contradictory especially when stratified by diabetes mellitus (DM) history.

Several of these enzymes are common components of replication complexes of other plus-strand RNA viruses, such as picornavirus 3C-like protease, papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and ribose 2-O-methyltransferase activities, while others such as exoribonuclease, endoribonuclease, and adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1-phosphatase activities, are rarely or not conserved in viruses outside the order Nidovirales. The latter enzymes are believed to be involved in unique metabolic pathways used by coronaviruses to (1) replicate and transcribe their extremely large RNA genomes, and (2) interfere with cellular functions and antiviral host responses. Since the global outbreak of SARS in 2003, major efforts have been made to elucidate the structures of the protein components of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex.

Considering the multifold mortality rate of COVID-19 in diabetic patients, this study proposes a COVID-19 risk prediction model for diabetic patients using a fuzzy inference system and machine learning approaches. This study aimed to estimate the risk level of COVID-19 in diabetic patients without a medical practitioner's advice for timely action and overcoming the multifold mortality rate of COVID-19 in diabetic patients. The proposed model takes eight input parameters, which were found as the most influential symptoms in diabetic patients. With the help of the various state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, fifteen models were built over the rule base. CatBoost classifier gives the best accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and kappa score. After hyper-parameter optimization, CatBoost classifier showed 76% accuracy and improvements in the recall, precision, F1 score, and kappa score, followed by logistic regression and XGBoost with 75.1% and 74.7% accuracy. Stratified k-fold cross-validation is used for validation purposes.","output":"COVID-19 Risk Prediction for Diabetic Patients Using Fuzzy Inference System and Machine Learning Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The objective of the study is to identify the risk factors associated with mortality at six weeks, especially by analyzing the role of antivirals and munomodulators.

PARTICIPANTS: Data from China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Vietnam from December 2019 to May 2020. METHODS: Simulations were generated of incubation period and of serial interval or generation time. From these, transmission times relative to symptom onset, and the proportion of presymptomatic transmission, were estimated. OUTCOME MEASURES: Transmission time of SARS-CoV-2 relative to symptom onset and proportion of presymptomatic transmission. RESULTS: Based on 18 serial interval/generation time estimates from 15 papers, mean transmission time relative to symptom onset ranged from ?2.6 (95% CI ?3.0 to C2.1) days before infector symptom onset to 1.4 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.8) days after symptom onset. The proportion of presymptomatic transmission ranged from 45.9% (95% CI 42.9% to 49.0%) to 69.1% (95% CI 66.2% to 71.9%). CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial potential for presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of different contexts.

This development raises the important question on the potential effects of the digitalisation of criminal justiceespecially from the viewpoint of the right to a fair trial. This contribution discusses this complicated question from different angles. It focuses on a number of different assumptions underlying the debate: the assumption that the use of technology in the courtroom diminishes human interaction, impedes an effective defence, influences decision-making and affects the legitimacy of the trial. This is done with the aim to shed light on the lack of evidentiary basis of these assumptions which clearly complicates the current discussion on the future of technology in the courtroom. The author argues that the validity of these assumptions needs to be adequately tested before we can make any long-term decisions on the content and scope of virtual criminal justice.","output":"Trials by video link after the pandemic: the pros and cons of the expansion of virtual justice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world, and has infected more than 1,436,000 people in more than 200 countries and territories as of April 9, 2020. Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to automatically diagnose COVID- 19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a 5-fold cross-validation. In the testing stage, we employ another independent large-scale testing dataset including 2796 CT scans from 2057 patients.

Incidence of VTE has been reported before and results varied widely in study cohorts. AREA OF UNCERTAINTY Incidence of major VTE (segmental pulmonary embolism and above and proximal deep vein thrombosis) which is a contributor to mortality and morbidity is not known. Also, data is unclear on the optimal anticoagulation regimen to prevent VTE. DATA SOURCES Multiple databases including PubMed were searched until May 12, 2020, to include studies reporting VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients. MOOSE guidelines were followed in selection, and 11 studies were included. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the VTE burden in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and potential benefits of therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation compared with prophylaxis dosing for VTE prevention. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES Many societies and experts recommend routine prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin for VTE prevention in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this meta-analysis, the pooled rate of major VTE was 12.5% in hospitalized patients and 17.2% in intensive care unit patients. When therapeutic anticoagulation dosing was compared with prophylactic anticoagulation, the pooled odds ratio of VTE was 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.14-0.75; P = 0.008, I = 0%) suggesting statistical significance with therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation for primary prevention of VTE in all hospitalized patients. However, this should be interpreted with caution as the bleeding events and safety profile could not be ascertained because of lack of adequate information. We recommend applying this finding to hospitalized COVID 19 patients only after carefully weighing individual bleeding risks and benefits. CONCLUSION Major VTE events, especially pulmonary embolism, seem to be high in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Therapeutic anticoagulation dosing seems to significantly benefit the odds of preventing any VTE when compared with prophylactic dosing in all hospitalized patients.","output":"Venous Thromboembolism in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense ssRNA genome, possess helical symmetry, and belongs to the family Coronaviridae. They cause mild to lethal respiratory tract infections in both mammals and birds. The more pathogenic coronaviruses cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The recent coronavirus outbreak was first discovered in December 2019. Subsequently, the disease has been declared as a pandemic by The World Health Organization (WHO). The virus is named Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease is now called COVID-19 [Coronavirus disease 2019]. The primary route of the virus spread between people is through close contact where a healthy person inhales the respiratory droplets from an infected person either by cough or sneezing. More than 2 million confirmed cases are reported globally. The US has the world's largest number of COVID-19 cases followed by European countries. As of April 18, 2020, 2 074 529 confirmed, and 139 378 deaths were reported. Presently, there is no specific drug or vaccine that is approved to treat SARS-CoV-2. The practice of hygienic measures such as frequent hand wash, use of masks, and social distancing would prevent the spread of the disease.

This study aims to evaluate the trend of health service utilization before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at selected hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHOD: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 1(st) through 30(th) of August 2020 using a mixed-methods design. For the quantitative evaluation, ten months' time-series data, starting from September 2019 to July 2020 was retrieved from the HMIS unit of each hospital. Microsoft excel v.2010 was used to analyze quantitative data. Qualitative data was collected using a semi-structured key-informant interview guide and analyzed using QDA-minor software. RESULTS: Twelve service delivery departments were included in the evaluation of each hospital. Of all, OPD, ART, VCT, PICT, and EPI services showed major disruption in both hospitals following the COVID-19 outbreak. Noticeable change was recorded in March and April for most units. Qualitative exploration showed multiple challenges namely; inadequate supply, poor infrastructure, low service utilization, staff workload, increased risk, poor job satisfaction of health professionals, and perception or attitude-related problems to be persistent at the hospitals. CONCLUSION: Main service delivery units of the hospitals, such as OPD, ART, VCT, PICT, and EPI have faced massive depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Turkey is severely affected with the first case being reported on March 11th 2020. Several studies suggest an association between air pollution and the spread of the infection, and that ambient particulate matters (PM) can present a potential, as virus carriers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on ambient PM. METHODS: Ambient PM samples in various size ranges were collected from 13 sites including urban, urban background locations and hospital gardens in 10 cities including Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Zonguldak, Tekirdag, Eskisehir, Bolu, Bursa, Konya, and Antalya across Turkey, between 13th of May and 14th of June, 2020. The nucleocapsid (N) 1 gene and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene expressions were analyzed in PM samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by applying quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and three dimensional (3D)-digital PCR methods. RESULTS: A total of 155 daily samples (Total Suspended Particulate [TSP], n=80;PM2.5, n=33;PM2.5-10, n=23;PM10, n=19;and 6 size segregated, n=48) were collected using various samplers in the each city. According to RT-PCR and 3D-RT-PCR analysis, dual RdRP and N1 gene positivity were detected in 20 of the samples (9.8 %). The highest percentage of virus detection on PM samples was from hospital gardens in Tekirda Zonguldak, and Istanbul, especially in PM2.5 mode. Samples collected from two urban sites, Ankara and Eskisehir, were also positive. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be transported by ambient particles, especially at sites close to the infection hot-spots such as hospital gardens. Whether this has an impact on the spread of the virus infection remains to be determined.","output":"Presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on particulate matters: A multi central study in turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has caused great damage to global public health Wuhan is the first outbreak city in China, with the obviously","output":"Clinical Characteristics between COVID-19 Patients In and Outside Wuhan: A Multiple-Centered Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kidney failure is common in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.

Genotyping for APOL1 G1 and G2 alleles was performed in 107 African American and Hispanic patients. Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 was utilized to assess direct viral infection in 273 cases along with clinical information at the time of biopsy. The leading indication for native biopsy was acute kidney injury (45.4%), followed by proteinuria with or without concurrent acute kidney injury (42.6%). There were more African American patients (44.6%) than patients of other ethnicities. The most common diagnosis in native biopsies was collapsing glomerulopathy (25.8%) which associated with high-risk APOL1 genotypes in 91.7% of cases.

METHODS: Weekly stroke admission & discharge counts in the three HASUs were collected locally from Emergency Department (ED) data and Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme core dataset prior to, and during the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Jan 2020 to May 2020). Whilst adjusting for local traffic-related air pollution and ambient measurement, an interrupted time-series analysis using a segmented generalised linear model investigated key population level events on the rate of stroke team ED assessments, admissions for stroke, referrals for transient ischaemic attack (TIA), and stroke discharges. RESULTS: The median total number of ED stroke assessments, admissions, TIA referrals, and discharges across the three HASU sites prior to the first UK COVID-19 death were 150, 114, 69, and 76 per week. The stable weekly trend in ED assessments and stroke admissions decreased by approximately 16% (and 21% for TIAs) between first UK hospital COVID-19 death (5th March) and the implementation of the Act-FAST campaign (6th April) where a modest 4% and 5% increase per week was observed.

In this paper, we apply the SIR model to simulating the propagation dynamics of COVID-19 on the Cape Verde Islands. It will be done firstly for Santiago and Boavista Islands, ant then for Cape Verde in general. The choice of Santiago rests on the fact that it is the largest island, with more than 50% of the Population of the country, whereas Boavista was chosen because it is the island where the first case of COVID-19 in Cape Verde was diagnosed.

Despite their highly potent antimicrobial activity, the adoption of photoactive materials to reduce infection transmission in hospitals and related healthcare facilities has been severely hampered by the lack of scalable and cost-effective manufacturing, in which case high-volume production methods for fabricating aPDI-based materials are needed. To address this issue here, we examined the antimicrobial efficacy of a simple bicomponent spray coating composed of the commercially-available UV-photocrosslinkable polymer N-methyl-4(4'-formyl-styryl)pyridinium methosulfate acetal poly(vinyl alcohol) (SbQ-PVA) and one of three aPDI photosensitizers (PSs): zinc-tetra(4-N-methylpyridyl)porphine (ZnTMPyP(4+)), methylene blue (MB), and Rose Bengal (RB). We applied these photodynamic coatings, collectively termed SbQ-PVA/PS, to a variety of commercially available materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) confirmed the successful application of the coatings, while inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) revealed a photosensitizer loading of 0.09-0.78 nmol PS/mg material. The antimicrobial efficacy of the coated materials was evaluated against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-29213 and human coronavirus strain HCoV-229E. Upon illumination with visible light (60 min, 400-700 nm, 65  5 mW/cm(2)), the coated materials inactivated S. aureus by 97-99.999% and HCoV-229E by 92-99.999%, depending on the material and PS employed. Photobleaching studies employing HCoV-229E demonstrated detection limit inactivation (99.999%) even after exposure for 4 weeks to indoor ambient room lighting. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential for photodynamic SbQ-PVA/PS coatings to be universally applied to a wide range of materials for effectively reducing pathogen transmission.","output":"Toward Universal Photodynamic Coatings for Infection Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the pressure on healthcare authorities to assess whether hospital capacity allows properly responding to outbreaks such as COVID-19, there is a need for simple, data-driven methods that may provide accurate forecasts of hospital bed demand.

METHODS AND MATERIALS An anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey was administered to non-trainee physician members of the American Brachytherapy Society. Burnout was evaluated using the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS). Demographic and practice-specific questions were collected from respondents. Univariate and multivariable analysis of outcomes were performed using probabilistic index models. RESULTS Overall, 51 of 400 physicians responded (13% response rate). Fifty-seven percent of respondents demonstrated at least one symptom of professional burnout. However, only 6% of respondents met strict criteria for high burnout. Analysis of the individual MBI-HSS subdomains demonstrated higher subscale scores for emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, but also higher scores for personal accomplishment. On multivariable analysis after adjusting for increased feelings of burnout due to the COVID-19 pandemic or total hours of work per week, younger age was associated with both increased subscale scores for emotional exhaustion (p = 0.026) and lower personal accomplishment (p = 0.010). Lastly, nearly half of all respondents (47%) reported increased feelings of burnout due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents from academic facilities were significantly more likely to report increased burnout due to COVID-19 compared to those from non-academic facilities (odds ratio, 7.04; 95% CI 1.60-31.0; p = 0.010).

The current pandemic involving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has highlighted limitations to the ordinary provision of personal protective equipment (PPE). For perioperative healthcare workers, N95 masks provide a stark example of PPE in short supply necessitating the creation of scientifically valid protocols for their decontamination and reuse. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify peer-reviewed articles related to N95 mask decontamination and subsequent testing for the integrity of mask filtration and facial seal. To expand this search, we additionally surveyed the official statements from key health agencies, organizations, and societies for relevant citations. RESULTS: Our initial database search resulted in five articles that met inclusion criteria, with 26 articles added from the expanded search. Our search did not reveal any relevant randomized clinical trials or cohort studies. We found that moist mask heating (65C80C at 50C85% relative humidity for 20C30 min) and vaporous hydrogen peroxide treatment were supported by the literature to provide consistent viral decontamination without compromising mask seal and filtration efficiency. Other investigated decontamination methods lacked comprehensive scientific evidence for all three of these key criteria. CONCLUSIONS: N95 mask reprocessing using either moist heat or vaporous hydrogen peroxide is recommended to ensure healthcare worker safety.

Methods This was an observational, retrospective cohort study from a nine ED health system in the United States of admitted adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and a  6 L/min oxygen requirement. We sought to predict respiratory failure within 24 hours of admission as defined by oxygen requirement of  10 L/min, any high-flow device, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Predictive models were compared to the Elixhauser comorbidity index, quick serial organ failure assessment (qSOFA), and the CURB-65 pneumonia severity score. Results During the study period from March 1 to April 27, 2020, 1,792 patients were admitted with COVID-19, 620 (35%) of whom had respiratory failure in the ED. Of the remaining 1,172 admitted patients, 144 (12.3%) met the composite endpoint within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Using area under receiver-operating characteristic curves, we compared the performance of a novel bedside scoring system, the quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) composed of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and oxygen flow rate (mean [95% CI]) (0.81 [0.73-0.89]), a machine- learning model, the COVID-19 severity index (0.76 [0.65-0.86]), to the Elixhauser mortality index (0.61 [0.51-0.70])), CURB-65 (0.50 [0.40-0.60]), and qSOFA (0.59 [0.50-0.68]).

The study also explored the students experiences related to barriers and facilitators of program utilization. In phase one, the FDP occurred for eight months and students could attend twice per month, receiving up to 60 pounds of food per visit.

A possible mechanism underlying this maladaptive avoidance behavior is a failure to reflect on: (1) appropriate levels of uncertainty about the situation, and (2) how this uncertainty could be reduced by seeking further information (i.e., exploration). To test this hypothesis, we asked a community sample of 416 individuals to complete measures of reflective cognition, exploration, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found significant associations between each of these measures in expected directions (i.e., positive relationships between reflective cognition and strategic information-seeking behavior or directed exploration, and negative relationships between these measures and anxiety/depression symptoms). Further analyses suggested that the relationship between directed exploration and depression/anxiety was due in part to an ambiguity aversion promoting exploration in conditions where information-seeking was not beneficial (as opposed to only being due to under-exploration when more information would aid future choices). In contrast, reflectiveness was associated with greater exploration in appropriate settings and separately accounted for differences in reaction times, decision noise, and choice accuracy in expected directions. These results shed light on the mechanisms underlying information-seeking behavior and how they may contribute to symptoms of emotional disorders.

Methods Serum of both patients and controls was collected on day 1 (D1; before the first BNT162b2 or AZD1222 dose), on day 22 (D22; before the second dose of the BNT162b2 or 3 weeks post the first AZD1222 dose) and on day 50 (D50; 4 weeks post second dose of the BNT162b2 or 7 weeks post the first AZD1222 dose). NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using FDA approved-ELISA methodology. Results Patients with MM (n=213), SMM (n=38) and MGUS (n=25) and 226 healthy controls, of similar age and gender, were enrolled in the study (NCT04743388). Two hundred and fifteen patients (77.9%) were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 and 61 (22.1%) with the AZD1222 vaccine. Vaccination with either two doses of the BNT162b2 or one dose of the AZD1222 vaccine leads to lower production of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in patients compared with controls both on day 22 and on day 50 (P<0.001 for all comparisons). After the first dose of the vaccine, on D22, the median NAb inhibition titer was 27% (IQR: 15.3-42%) for patients versus 38.7% (IQR: 22-54.3%) for controls (P<0.001). On D50, the median NAb inhibition titer was 62.8% (IQR: 26-88.9%) for patients versus 90% (IQR: 58-96.4%) for controls (P<0.001). The respective number of patients and controls who developed NAb titers 50% (clinically relevant titers) was 158 (57.3%) and 183 (81%), respectively (P<0.001). Furthermore, MM patients showed an inferior NAb response compared with MGUS on day 22 (p=0.009) and on day 50 (p=0.003); MGUS patients NAb development was similar to controls.

Seventy-one (33%) and 68 patients (31.6%) reported mild reactions after the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, respectively. Twenty (32.8%) patients vaccinated with the first dose of AZD1222 also presented with local reactions. Conclusion In conclusion, MM patients have lower humoral response following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared to gender- and age-matched controls. Treatment with anti-CD38 and belamaf-based regimens as well as lymphopenia at the time of vaccination independently predicted for poor NAb development. These data underline the need for timely vaccination, ideally during a treatment-free period, and for continuous vigilance on infection control measures.","output":"P-127: Patients with Multiple Myeloma on treatment with Anti-CD38 or Anti-BCMA agents have a suboptimal humoral response following COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Risk factors for child abuse and neglect and commonly used reporting mechanisms were highly affected by SARS-Cov-2 pandemic; yet, little is known about the effects of SARS-Cov-2 on rates of child abuse and neglect. OBJECTIVE To compare overall rates, demographics, types of abuse and acuity of child abuse and neglect encounters seen at one university health system for the 6 months before and after school closings due to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Data was extracted from a database of billed ICD10 codes for child abuse and neglect including sexual abuse codes. There were 579 encounters for patients <18 years of age and 476 unique patients. METHODS In addition to ICD10 code and pre/post school closing, each encounter was identified to be inpatient, outpatient and/or emergency department. Demographic data such as age, gender, ethnicity, and race were extracted. Incident rate ratios in addition to descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sample t-test, or the chi-square test of association were used in the analysis. RESULTS No significant differences were identified for total rates of child abuse and neglect encounters (p = .08), physical abuse (p = .91) nor child maltreatment (p = .86) codes or in the age (p = .46), gender (p = .58), and race/ethnicity (p = .15) of patient encounters pre- versus post-school closings. The sexual abuse incidence and inpatient encounters increased by 85% (IRR = 1.85, p < .0001; IRR = 1.85, p = .004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide a unique contribution to the existing literature in that we identified a significant increase in the incidence of sexual abuse and higher patient acuity as evidenced by higher rates of inpatient encounters after school closing due to SARS-Cov-2.","output":"A comparison of child abuse and neglect encounters before and after school closings due to SARS-Cov-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Regular physical activity is essential for asthma control in children, but it remains understudied within the context of COVID-19. Physical activity and sedentary time levels before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among children with asthma were documented and differences by characteristics were explored. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional self-administered online survey study of 5- to 17-year-old children with asthma from the United States between December 2020 and April 2021. RESULTS: This study included 68 children with asthma. Although only 4.6% of the children were fully inactive before the pandemic, this number increased to 24.6% during the survey period (p < 0.001). Children spent significantly less time outdoors and more time in front of screens during the pandemic versus before (p < 0.001). The variety of activities in which children with asthma engaged in during the pandemic was lower than what they used to do prior to the COVID-19 crisis. Boys, Hispanic children, those of low-income households, and those not attending school in-person were significantly associated with less participation in physical activity during the pandemic. Ethnicity remained significantly associated after adjusting for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, children with asthma were less active and spent more time in front of screens and less time outdoors. Subgroup analyses revealed individual, parental, and organizational characteristics being associated with differential participation in physical activity, highlighting disparities in opportunities for children with asthma of different circumstances to remain active and healthy during the pandemic.

The aim of this study was to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of HCWs during the hospital lockdown period due to mass healthcare-associated infection during the early spread of COVID-19. METHODS: A real-time online survey was conducted between April 14C18, 2020 among HCWs who worked at the university hospital where COVID-19 was confirmed in a patient, and the hospital was shut down for 3 weeks. Along with demographic variables and work-related information, psychological distress was measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey scale, and the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9. RESULTS: The HCWs working in the cohort ward and those who have experienced social discrimination had significantly higher level of depression (PHQ-9 score; 5.24  4.48 vs. 4.15  4.38; P < 0.01 and 5.89  4.78 vs. 3.25  3.77; P < 0.001, respectively) and anxiety (GAD-7 score; 3.69  3.68 vs. 2.87  3.73; P < 0.05 and 4.20  4.22 vs. 2.17  3.06; P < 0.001, respectively) compared to other HCWs. Worries regarding the peer relationship and the skepticism about job were associated with depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07C1.79; P < 0.05 and OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.31C2.17; P < 0.001, respectively) and anxiety (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.21C2.49; P < 0.01 and OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09C2.17; P < 0.05, respectively), while fear of infection or worsening of health was not. Path analysis showed that work-related stress associated with the viral epidemic rather than anxiety about the viral epidemic mainly contributed to depression. CONCLUSION: The present observational study indicates that mental health problems of HCWs exposed to COVID-19 are associated with distress in work and social relationship.

However, evidence from a pilot trial using an LFAT to identify asymptomatic infections in the community suggested that the test missed over half of the positive cases in the tested population. This raises the question of whether it can be ethical to use an inaccurate test to guide public health measures. We begin by explicating different dimensions of test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value), and why they matter morally, before highlighting key data from the Liverpool pilot. We argue that the poor sensitivity of the LFAT in this pilot trial suggests that there are important limitations to what we can expect these tests to achieve. A test with low sensitivity will provide false-negative results, and in doing so generate the risk of false assurance and its attendant moral costs. However, we also suggest that the deployment of an insensitive but specific test could identify many asymptomatic carriers of the virus who are currently being missed under existing arrangements. Having outlined ways in which the costs of false reassurance could potentially be mitigated, we conclude that the use of an insensitive LFAT in mass testing may be ethical if (1) it is used predominantly to identify positive cases, (2) it is a cost-effective method of achieving that goal and (3) if other public health tools can effectively prevent widespread false reassurance.","output":"Sense and sensitivity: can an inaccurate test be better than no test at all?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a probabilistic method for classifying chest computed tomography (CT) scans into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19.

Given the potential of neutrophils to impart extensive tissue damage, it is perhaps not surprising that when augmented these cells are also implicated in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. Prominent neutrophilic inflammation is a hallmark feature of patients with chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis, with their numbers frequently associating with worse prognosis. Accordingly, it is anticipated that neutrophils are central to the pathology of these diseases and represent an attractive therapeutic target. However, in many instances, evidence directly linking neutrophils to the pathology of disease has remained somewhat circumstantial and strategies that have looked to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in the clinic have proved largely disappointing. We have classically viewed neutrophils as somewhat crude, terminally differentiated, insular and homogenous protagonists of pathology. However, it is now clear that this does not do the neutrophil justice, and we now recognize that these cells exhibit heterogeneity, a pronounced awareness of the localized environment and a remarkable capacity to interact with and modulate the behaviour of a multitude of cells, even exhibiting anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving and pro-repair functions.

METHOD: We reviewed medical records of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 positive results via reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests at Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz Hospital, Riyadh between May and August 2020. Data were obtained for patients demography, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities. Additional data on patients that required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and clinical outcomes were recorded and analyzed with Python Pandas. RESULTS: A total of 565 COVID-19 positive patients were inducted in the study out of which, 63 (11.1%) patients died while 101 (17.9%) patients required ICU admission. Disease incidences were significantly higher in males and non-Saudi nationals. Patients with cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal diseases displayed significantly higher association with ICU admissions (p<0.001) while mortality rates were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and neurological diseases.

Leptin activates the secretion of chemical mediators, which contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and psoriasis. Conversely, adiposity and obesity are the major aggravating risk factors in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MetS), including type II diabetes mellitus and obesity-associated hypertension. Elevated level of leptin in obesity-associated hypertension causes an increase in the production of aldosterone, which also results in elevation of arterial blood pressure.

Objectives: To report and explore changes in admission rates, patient characteristics, processes of care and outcomes for all patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Methods: Population cohort of 10,287 patients with COVID-19 in the Case Mix Programme national clinical audit from 1 February to 2 July, 2020. Analyses were stratified by time period (pre-peak, peak, post-peak) and geographical region. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate differences in 28-day mortality, adjusting for patient characteristics over time. Main results: Admissions to ICU peaked simultaneously across regions on 1 April, with ongoing admissions peaking ten days later. Compared with pre- and post-peak periods, patients admitted during the peak were slightly younger but had greater respiratory and renal dysfunction. Use of invasive ventilation and renal replacement reduced over time. Twenty-eight-day mortality reduced from 43.5% (95% CI 41.6% to 45.5%) pre-peak to 34.3% (95% CI 32.3% to 36.2%) post-peak;a difference of ?8.8% (95% CI: ?5.2%, ?12.3%) after adjusting for patient characteristics.

Methods: in this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed case notes of 404 adults who used our videoconsultation service from 20/04/2020 to 03/05/2020. We compared these to 451 patient who attended eye casualty in person at the same time who were deemed not to require same day ophthalmic examination. Findings: patients seen by videoconsultations tended to be younger (Median = 43 years, Inter-quartile range = 27 vs Median= 49 years, Inter-quartile range = 28)'. More males used the face-to-face triage (55%) while more females used videoconsultation (54%)%. Fewer patients seen by videoconsultations required specialist review compared to face-face triage [X 2 (1, N = 854) = 128.02, p<0.001)]. 35.5% of the patients initially seen by videoconsultation had unplanned reattendance within 1 month, compared to 15.7% in the group initially seen in person. X 2 (1, N = 234) = 7.31, p = 0.007). The rate of actual harm was no different (at 0% for each method), with perfect inter-grader correlation when graded independently by two senior ophthalmologists. 97% of patients seen on the video platform surveyed were satisfied with their care. Interpretation: we demonstrate comparable patient safety of videoconsultations at one-month follow-up to in person review. The service is acceptable to patients and reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We propose that videoconsultations are effective and desirable as a tool for triage in ophthalmology.

This model positions C4b near the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) loops of the penton base. There are multiple amino acids in the RGD loop that might serve as covalent binding sites for the reactive thioester of C4b. Molecular dynamics simulations with a multimeric penton base and C4b indicated that stabilizing interactions may form between C4b and multiple RGD loops.

Whether this has been associated with delayed reperfusion and worse outcomes in French patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unknown. AIM: To compare the rate of STEMI admissions, treatment delays, and outcomes between the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and the equivalent period in 2019. METHODS: In this nationwide French survey, data from consecutive STEMI patients from 65 centres referred for urgent revascularization between 1 March and 31 May 2020, and between 1 March and 31 May 2019, were analysed. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death or non-fatal mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: A total of 6306 patients were included. During the pandemic peak, a 13.9+/-6.6% (P=0.003) decrease in STEMI admissions per week was observed. Delays between symptom onset and percutaneous coronary intervention were longer in 2020 versus 2019 (270 [interquartile range 150-705] vs 245 [140-646]min;P=0.013), driven by the increase in time from symptom onset to first medical contact (121 [60-360] vs 150 [62-420]min;P=0.002). During 2020, a greater number of mechanical complications was observed (0.9% vs 1.7%;P=0.029) leading to a significant difference in the primary outcome (112 patients [5.6%] in 2019 vs 129 [7.6%] in 2020;P=0.018). No significant difference was observed in rates of orotracheal intubation, in-hospital cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. CONCLUSIONS: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, there was a decrease in STEMI admissions, associated with longer ischaemic time, exclusively driven by an increase in patient-related delays and an increase in mechanical complications. These findings suggest the need to encourage the population to seek medical help in case of symptoms.","output":"ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Management and association with prognosis during the COVID-19 pandemic in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, conventional treatment is not sufficient to improve the survival of glioma patients. Hence, adopting novel personalized treatment programs is imperative. Curcumol, a Chinese herbal medicine extract from the roots of Rhizoma Curcumae, has attracted significant interest due to its beneficial pharmacological activities. The current study revealed that curcumol inhibited the proliferation, metastasis, self-renewal ability, and TMZ resistance in glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. Next, the potential molecular mechanisms of curcumol in inhibiting glioma were investigated. We found that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) FOXD2-As1 might contribute to the effects of curcumol on glioma cells. Enforced expression of FOXD2-As1 attenuated the curcumol-induced reduction in glioma cell proliferation, metastasis, self-renewal ability, and TMZ resistance. Moreover, the forced expression of FOXD2-As1 reversed the inhibitory effect of curcumol on the binding ability of EZH2 and H3K27me3 modification in the promoter regions of anti-oncogenes. Our results showed for the first time that curcumol is effective in inhibiting malignant biological behaviors and TMZ-resistance of glioma cells by suppressing FOXD2-As1-mediated EZH2 activation. Our study offers the possibility of exploiting curcumol as a promising therapeutic agent for glioma treatment and may provide an option for the clinical application of this natural herbal medicine.","output":"Curcumol inhibits malignant biological behaviors and TMZ-resistance in glioma cells by inhibiting long noncoding RNA FOXD2-As1-promoted EZH2 activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious illness that occurs among premature infants and term-born infants with congenital heart disease (CHD).

Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review of infants treated for Bells stage 2-3 NEC from 2011 to 2020 was performed. Demographic information, CHD diagnoses and clinical data were recorded. Prior to data analysis, patients were divided into two groups: term-born patients with CHD (TC) and premature patients without CHD (PT).

In this study, we have explored the application of ML-based algorithms to predict cause of death (CoD) from verbal autopsy records available through the Million Death Study (MDS). METHODS: From MDS, 18826 unique childhood deaths at ages 1C59 months during the time period 2004C13 were selected for generating the prediction models of which over 70% of deaths were caused by six infectious diseases (pneumonia, diarrhoeal diseases, malaria, fever of unknown origin, meningitis/encephalitis, and measles). Six popular ML-based algorithms such as support vector machine, gradient boosting modeling, C5.0, artificial neural network, k-nearest neighbor, classification and regression tree were used for building the CoD prediction models. RESULTS: SVM algorithm was the best performer with a prediction accuracy of over 0.8. The highest accuracy was found for diarrhoeal diseases (accuracy = 0.97) and the lowest was for meningitis/encephalitis (accuracy = 0.80). The top signs/symptoms for classification of these CoDs were also extracted for each of the diseases. A combination of signs/symptoms presented by the deceased individual can effectively lead to the CoD diagnosis.

However, demand for COVID-19 vaccines is expected to exceed supply during the first months of the national COVID-19 vaccination program. On December 20, 2020, ACIP recommended that in Phase 1b, vaccine should be offered to persons aged 75 years and frontline essential workers, and that in Phase 1c, persons aged 65-74 years, persons aged 16-64 years with high-risk medical conditions, and essential workers not recommended for vaccination in Phase 1b should be offered vaccine. These recommendations for phased allocation provide guidance for federal, state, and local jurisdictions while vaccine supply is limited. ACIP's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine allocation are interim and might be updated based on changes in conditions of FDA Emergency Use Authorization, FDA authorization for new COVID-19 vaccines, changes in vaccine supply, or changes in COVID-19 epidemiology. To inform policy options for ACIP, the COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group, comprising experts in infectious diseases, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, held 28 meetings to review data regarding vaccine candidates, COVID-19 surveillance, modeling of allocation scenarios, and vaccination program implementation issues. Approximately 49 million persons, including frontline essential workers and persons aged 75 years are recommended to receive vaccine in Phase 1b of the COVID-19 vaccination program. ACIP used CISA guidance to define frontline essential workers as the subset of essential workers likely at highest risk for work-related exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, because their work-related duties must be performed on-site and involve being in close proximity to the public or to coworkers. Although there is no national surveillance for COVID-19 among frontline or other essential workers, reports of high incidence and outbreaks within multiple critical infrastructure sectors illustrate the COVID-19 risk in these populations and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on workers who belong to racial and ethnic minority groups. The overall proportion of persons aged 75 years who live in a multigenerational household is 6%;the proportion among non-Hispanic White persons is 4%, and the proportion among racial or ethnic minority groups is higher (non-Hispanic Black persons, 10%;Hispanic or Latino persons, 18%;non-Hispanic persons of other races, 20%). In Phase 1c, vaccine should be offered to persons aged 65-74 years, persons aged 16-64 years with medical conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19, and essential workers not previously included in Phase 1a or 1b. Allocation of COVID-19 vaccine to essential workers and persons at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease balances the vaccination program priorities of minimizing societal disruption and preventing morbidity and mortality. Allocation to persons aged 75 years is supported by their high risk for COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality and is anticipated to also reduce hospitalizations in this group, easing the burden on strained health care systems.","output":"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' updated interim recommendation for allocation of COVID-19 vaccine - United States, December 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Discrimination, abuse and mistreatment are prevailing problems reported in neurosurgical-training programs globally. Moreover, the current COVID-19-pandemic may also display a negative impact on burnout levels in neurosurgery-residents.

METHODS: Patients undergoing curative-intent resection for primary liver malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) between 2005 and 2017 were analyzed using a large, international multi-institutional dataset. Rates of TO were assessed over time. Factors associated with achieving a TO and the impact of TO on long-term survival were examined. RESULTS: Among 1829 patients, 944 (51.6%) and 885 (48.4%) individuals underwent curative-intent resection for HCC and ICC, respectively. Over time, patients were older, more frequently had ASA class > 2, albumin-bilirubin grade 2/3, major vascular invasion and more frequently underwent major liver resection (all p < 0.05). Overall, a total of 1126 (62.0%) patients achieved a TO. No increasing trends in TO rates were noted over the years (ptrend = 0.90). In addition, there was no increasing trend in the TO rates among patients undergoing either major (ptrend = 0.39) or minor liver resection (ptrend = 0.63) over the study period.

TMPRSS2 is regulated by androgen receptor. It is well described Androgen Receptor Directed Therapy (ARDT) downregulates the expression of TMPRSS2. We hypothesized that the ARDT has a protective role in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) from poor outcome of COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective chart review of PCa patients with COVID-19 between March to October 2020 in the Yale-New Haven Health System was performed. Demographics, comorbidities, home medications, laboratory data, treatment, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 were collected. ARDT was defined as the use of GnRH agonist, GnRH antagonist, or androgen receptor antagonist. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Yale University. Results: A total of 146 (1.1%) prostate cancer cases were identified from the 13,642 cases of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics are summarized in the table. Twenty-five (17%) were on active ARDT and 121 (83%) not on ARDT (non-ARDT). The rates of hospitalization were the same: 52%, between the ARDT and non-ARDT group. Of those admitted, mean duration of hospitalization were 9.2 days (Range 1-25) and 14.9 days (Range: 2-47) in ARDT and non-ARDT groups, respectively (p=0.14). Rates of hospital stay >30 days were 0% versus 14.3% (9/63) in ARDT and non-ARDT groups, respectively (p=0.15).

The effects on patients' interest of elective neurosurgical procedures are currently unexplored. METHODS Using Google Trends (GT), search terms of seven different neurosurgical procedure categories (Trauma, Spine, Tumor, Movement Disorder, Epilepsy, Endovascular, and Miscellaneous) were assessed in terms of relative search volume (RSV) between January 2015 and September 2020. Analyses of search terms were performed for over the short-term (Feb 18th, 2020-Apr 18th, 2020), intermediate-term (Jan 1st, 2020-May 31st, 2020) and long-term (Jan 2015-Sept 2020). State-level interest during phase I re-opening (Apr 28th, 2020-May 31st, 2020) was also evaluated. RESULTS In the short-term, RSV of four categories (epilepsy, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. In the intermediate-term, RSV of five categories (miscellaneous, epilepsy, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. In the long-term, RSV of nearly all categories (endovascular, epilepsy, miscellaneous, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. Only the movement disorder procedure category had significantly higher RSV in states that reopened early. CONCLUSION With the recommendation for cessation of elective surgeries, patient interest in overall elective neurosurgical procedures have dropped significantly.

The CO2-concentration (c) emitted simultaneously is 7500 ppm. It is investigated, if the spatial dissipation of aerosols and CO2 can be correlated. This would allow the use of technically easier CO2 measurements to monitor compliance with aerosol concentration limits. Both aerosol and CO2 concentrations are mapped by different sensors placed around the mannequin. As a result, no significant enrichment of aerosols and CO2 was obtained outside a radius of 1.5 m when the fresh air ventilation in the concert hall has a steady vertical flow with a velocity of vg,z=0.05&nbsp;m/s and the installed ventilation system was operating at an air change rate per hour (ACH) of 3, corresponding to an air exchange rate of 51,000 m3/h. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.77 was obtained for CO2 and aerosol concentrations measured simultaneously at different positions within the concert hall.","output":"Experimental Investigation of Aerosol and CO2 Dispersion for Evaluation of COVID-19 Infection Risk in a Concert Hall"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM Liver injury has been frequently reported in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data are still lacking regarding the impact of pre-existing liver damage and neoplasia on SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome and vice-versa. This study aimed to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients, both in therapeutic-na?ve and patients treated with direct acting antivirals. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 21 patients with a personal history of HCV infection, that have been diagnosed with different forms of HCC and who were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were monitored by liver function tests, tumoral markers, blood cell count, and coagulation profile periodically. RESULTS Solitary HCC nodules were predominant among the subjects who achieved sustained virologic response, while multinodular and infiltrative patterns were mostly prevalent among the treatment-na?ve group. Most patients had mild and moderate COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSION Within the current global pandemic crisis, cancer patients are highly vulnerable and in need of constant monitoring.

Here, we intended developing effective models for the late identification of patients at disease progression and outcome. METHODS: A total of 197 patients were included with a 20\\\\day median follow\\\\up time. We first developed a nomogram for disease severity discrimination, then created a prognostic nomogram for severe patients. RESULTS: In total, 40.6% of patients were severe and 59.4% were non\\\\severe. The multivariate logistic analysis indicated that IgG, neutrophil\\\\to\\\\lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase, platelet, albumin, and blood urea nitrogen were significant factors associated with the severity of COVID\\\\19. Using immune response phenotyping based on NLR and IgG level, the logistic model showed patients with the NLR(hi)IgG(hi) phenotype are most likely to have severe disease, especially compared to those with the NLR(lo)IgG(lo) phenotype. The C\\\\indices of the two discriminative nomograms were 0.86 and 0.87, respectively, which indicated sufficient discriminative power. As for predicting clinical outcomes for severe patients, IgG, NLR, age, lactate dehydrogenase, platelet, monocytes, and procalcitonin were significant predictors. The prognosis of severe patients with the NLR(hi)IgG(hi) phenotype was significantly worse than the NLR(lo)IgG(hi) group. The two prognostic nomograms also showed good performance in estimating the risk of progression. CONCLUSIONS: The present nomogram models are useful to identify COVID\\\\19 patients with disease progression based on individual characteristics and immune response\\\\related indicators. Patients at high risk for severe illness and poor outcomes from COVID\\\\19 should be managed with intensive supportive care and appropriate therapeutic strategies.","output":"A nomogram prediction of outcome in patients with COVID\\\\19 based on individual characteristics incorporating immune response\\\\related indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care organizations have been challenged by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for some time, while in January 2020, it was not immediately suspected that it would take such a global expansion.

This report has now examined whether this is also the case in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the lockdown, hospitals turned out to be the only remaining soft targets for attacks, given that the other classic targets were closed during the lockdown. On the other hand, other important factors have limited the risk of such attacks in hospitals. The main delaying and relative risk-reducing factors were the access control on temperature and wearing a mask, no visits allowed, limited consultations, and investigations. But even then, health care systems and hospitals were prone to (cyber)terrorism, as shown by other COVID-19-related institutions, such as pharmaceuticals involved in developing vaccines and health care facilities involved in swab testing and contact tracing.

Even during periods of physical distancing, continuing nutrition assessments amongst those without COVID-19 is vital given that high malnutrition prevalence exists in clinical settings. The investigation aim was to assess the reliability of utilising the validated Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) tool, without compared to with physical examination. Methodology Original paper-based SGA documentation from a hospital-wide audit was reassessed by a blinded experienced clinician using history alone without reviewing documented physical examination. Participants included adults admitted to a tertiary hospital with no maternity or obstetric services. Those terminally ill, undergoing end-of-life palliative care, with disordered eating or admitted to emergency or intensive care units were excluded. McNemars test assessed paired categorical data. Cohen's kappa coefficient assessed inter- and intra-rater reliability. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were completed. Results There was no significant difference in malnutrition identification (p<0.454) with 97% (473/489) of assessments identical. High sensitivity (87.2%, 68/78), specificity (98.9%, 405/411), positive (91.9%, 68/74) and negative (97.6%, 405/415) predictive values were evident. High inter- and intra-rater reliability was confirmed (kappa values 0.875 and 0.987). Conclusion The Abridged-SGA utilising the four key factors of the SGA history identified many malnourished amongst those without COVID-19 who otherwise would not be identified when physical distancing is required due to the pandemic. It did not overestimate malnutrition. Until alternative means of assessing physical parameters remotely are validated, the pragmatic value of practitioners judgement when utilising the Abridged-SGA was confirmed.","output":"Pilot investigation shows high sensitivity and specificity using an Abridged Subjective Global Assessment without physical examination in a tertiary hospital; pertinence for use amongst those without COVID-19 when physical distancing required during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults are susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes as a consequence of their age and, in some cases, underlying health conditions (1).

On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3).

Therefore, the study examines the determinants of savings creation within MEAT in Central European countries. It uses a dataset published in the Tenders Electronic Daily database in 2017C2018 about contract award notices and carries out a generalized linear model to study the determinants of savings creation within MEAT. The findings suggest that when services are procured within MEAT, the savings are considerably higher than compared to works. If the framework agreement takes place in a procurement process, the savings are significantly smaller. In cases where the subject of procurement is not co-financed by EU funds, the savings are higher than in the case that they are. If an open type of procurement is used, the savings are seemingly smaller than in cases where a non-open type of procurement takes place. When the contract is awarded to a single supplier, the savings are higher than otherwise. A higher number of total offers, as well as a higher number of offers from small and medium-sized enterprises, induce higher savings.

METHODS We compared data from RCTs with unselected standard care data. First, we systematically reviewed RCTs that investigated the effect of supervised exercise therapy in patients with intermittent claudication. For each of the RCTs, we extracted and categorized the eligibility criteria and their justifications. To assess whether people in RCTs (n = 1,440) differed from patients treated in daily practice (n = 3,513), in terms of demographics, comorbidity and walking capacity, we assessed between group-differences using t-tests. To assess differences in treatment response, we compared walking distances at three and six months between groups using t-tests. Differences of 15% were set as a marker for a clinically relevant difference. RESULTS All 20 included RCTs excluded large segments of patients with intermittent claudication. One-third of the RCTs eligibility criteria were justified. Despite, the numerous eligibility criteria, we found that baseline characteristics were largely comparable. A statistically significant and (borderline) clinically relevant difference in treatment response after three and six months between trial participants and standard care patients was found. Improvements in maximum walking distance after three and six months were significantly and clinically less in trial participants. CONCLUSIONS The finding that baseline characteristics of patients included in RCTs and patients treated in standard care were comparable, may indicate that RCT eligibility criteria are used implicitly by professionals when referring patients to standard physiotherapy care. The larger treatment response reported in standard physiotherapy care compared to clinical trials, might suggest that scientific studies underestimate the benefits of supervised exercise therapy in patients with intermittent claudication.","output":"How Well Do Randomized Controlled Trials Reflect Standard Care: A Comparison between Scientific Research Data and Standard Care Data in Patients with Intermittent Claudication undergoing Supervised Exercise Therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Everyone has an opportunity to contribute to climate solutions.

They also help shape public health policy and evidence-based health practices by identifying and quantifying health risks of exposure in defined populations. For more than a century, epidemiologists have studied the consequences of radiation exposures, yet the health effects of low levels delivered at a low-dose rate remain equivocal. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Million Person Study (MPS) of U.S. Radiation Workers and Veterans was designed to examine health effects following chronic exposures in contrast with brief exposures as experienced by the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Radiation associations for rare cancers, intakes of radionuclides, and differences between men and women are being evaluated, as well as noncancers such as cardiovascular disease and conditions such as dementia and cognitive function. The first international symposium, held November 6, 2020, provided a broad overview of the MPS. Representatives from four U.S. government agencies addressed the importance of this research for their respective missions: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), and the National Aeronautical Space Agency (NASA). The major components of the MPS were discussed and recent findings summarized. The importance of radiation dosimetry, an essential feature of each MPS investigation, was emphasized. RESULTS The seven components of the MPS are DOE workers, nuclear weapons test participants, nuclear power plant workers, industrial radiographers, medical radiation workers, nuclear submariners, other U.S. Navy personnel, and radium dial painters. The MPS cohorts include tens of thousands of workers with elevated intakes of alpha particle emitters for which organ-specific doses are determined. Findings to date for chronic radiation exposure suggest that leukemia risk is lower than after acute exposure; lung cancer risk is much lower and there is little difference in risks between men and women; an increase in ischemic heart disease is yet to be seen; esophageal cancer is frequently elevated but not myelodysplastic syndrome; and Parkinson's disease may be associated with radiation exposure. CONCLUSIONS The MPS has provided provocative insights into the possible range of health effects following low-level chronic radiation exposure. When the 34 MPS cohorts are completed and combined, a powerful evaluation of radiation-effects will be possible.

This study aims to find out whether or not social norms interventions are effective ways of encouraging health workers to carry out desired behaviours and to identify which types of social norms intervention, if any, are most effective. METHODS A systematic review will be conducted. The inclusion criteria are a population of health professionals, a social norms intervention that seeks to change a clinical behaviour, and randomised controlled trials. Searches will be undertaken in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO and Cochrane trials.

Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique groupfunctioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic. However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic. We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment. All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey. We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models. We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups. 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate). Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs. 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs. 33.7%). The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance. Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002].

As a response, the entire nation shutdown at the state-level for the duration of a ~1C3 months. These public health interventions, however, were not arbitrarily decided, but rather, implemented as a result of evidence-based practices. These practices were a result of lessons learned during the 1918 influenza pandemic and the city-level non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken across the US. During the 1918 pandemic, two model cities, St. Louis, MO, and Philadelphia, PA, carried out two different approaches to address the spreading disease, which resulted in two distinctly different outcomes. Our group has evaluated the state-level public health response adopted by states across the US, with a focus on New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and compared the effectiveness of reducing the spread of COVID-19.

Starting from this platform, supramolecular, discrete, triphenylbenzene-carbazole, covalent-organic framework, covalent-organic polymer and conjugated polymer based sensors have been developed for the selective detection of polynitroaromatic compounds, trinitrotoluene (TNT), dinitrotoluene (DNT) and picric acid (PA). Tris-salicylaldimine Schiff bases have been synthesized for the selective sensing of fluoride ions through a fluorescence turn-on mechanism.

Over the subsequent five months NPIs were eased in stages according to national strategy. Covid-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously, reaching rural areas by July and peaking in July-August. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic wellbeing and access to healthcare is limited. We therefore analysed how rural residents of three South African provinces changed their behaviour during the first epidemic wave. METHODS: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network (SAPRIN) nodes in Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal (AHRI) and Limpopo (DIMAMO) provinces conducted longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and peri-urban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on: Covid-19 knowledge and behaviours; health and economic impact of NPIs; and mental health. RESULTS: 2262 households completed 10,966 interviews between April and August 2020. By August, self-reported satisfaction with Covid-19 knowledge had risen from 48% to 85% and facemask use to over 95%. As selected NPIs were eased mobility increased, and economic losses and anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When Covid-19 cases spiked at one node in July, movement dropped rapidly, and missed daily medication rates doubled. Economic concerns and mental health symptoms were lower in households receiving a greater number of government-funded old-age pensions. CONCLUSIONS: South Africans reported complying with stringent Covid-19 NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programmes appeared to buffer interruptions in income and healthcare access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against impacts on wellbeing in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems where they threaten income and basic service access.","output":"Protective behaviours and secondary harms from non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa: a multisite prospective longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because at least some squirrel monkeys lack ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in the striate cortex (V1) that are detectable by cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry, the functional importance of ODCs on stereoscopic 3-D vision has been questioned. However, conventional CO histochemistry or trans-synaptic tracer study has limited capacity to reveal cortical functional architecture, whereas the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs), c-FOS and ZIF268, is more directly responsive to neuronal activity of cortical neurons to demonstrate ocular dominance (OD)-related domains in V1 following monocular inactivation. Thus, we wondered whether IEG expression would reveal ODCs in the squirrel monkey V1. In this study, we first examined CO histochemistry in V1 of five squirrel monkeys that were subjected to monocular enucleation or tetrodotoxin (TTX) treatment to address whether there is substantial cross-individual variation as reported previously. Then, we examined the IEG expression of the same V1 tissue to address whether OD-related domains are revealed. As a result, staining patterns of CO histochemistry were relatively homogeneous throughout layer 4 of V1. IEG expression was also moderate and homogeneous throughout layer 4 of V1 in all cases. On the other hand, the IEG expression was patchy in accordance with CO blobs outside layer 4, particularly in infragranular layers, although they may not directly represent OD clusters. Squirrel monkeys remain an exceptional species among anthropoid primates with regard to OD organization, and thus are potentially good subjects to study the development and function of ODCs.","output":"The Expression Patterns of Cytochrome Oxidase and Immediate-Early Genes Show Absence of Ocular Dominance Columns in the Striate Cortex of Squirrel Monkeys Following Monocular Inactivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of SARS, a life-threatening disease, has spread over many countries around the world.

The main question is how Israeli sex workers perceive the public debate over governing the Israeli sex industry. METHODS: This study combines qualitative methods that include ethnographic observations and interviews. The ethnographic observations were carried out between November 2018 and October 2019 in gatherings, protests, and academic conferences where sex workers were the lead speakers. In addition, 16 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with sex workers across various indoor sectors, and four interviews were conducted with political figures to learn about their efforts to adopt neo-abolitionist legislation. RESULTS: the Israeli legislative proceedings initiated in 2007 deny sex workers a voice and exclude them from the political space and policy debates that have a direct bearing on their working lives and wellbeing. Thus, Israeli sex workers perceive sex work governance as controlling their agency and deepening their stigmatization. In this process, we show how contrasting groups became strange bedfellows in their attempt to protect sex workers by incriminating clients of the sex industry. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the binary framings of debates about sex work in Israel do not address the actual needs or political desires of sex workers who are ignored and excluded from the discourse about them. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Furthermore, we conclude that the issue at hand is not about permitting sex workers to express their views but rather about the need to listen to their critiques to ensure that policy is built on their knowledge and experience.","output":"Who Takes Part in the Political Game?

Our study aims to develop and evaluate two rapid in-house ELISA assays targeting neutralizing antibodies (IgG) against S1 subunit of spike in SARS-CoV-2 and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), as well as comparative analysis with nucleocapsid (NCP) ELISA. The assays were conducted with 184 samples in three panels collected from 134 patients. Panel 1 and 2 consist of RT-PCR positive samples collected within two weeks and after two weeks of symptom onset, respectively. Negative samples are included in panel 3 from healthy donors and pre-pandemic dengue patients. The total assay time has been set 30 minutes for both of the ELISA assays. Results show that S1 and RBD ELISA demonstrates 73.68% and 84.21% sensitivities, respectively for samples collected within two weeks, whereas 100% sensitivities were achieved by both for samples that were collected after two weeks of the onset of symptoms. S1-ELISA shows 0% positivity to panel 3 while for RBD-ELISA the figure is 1%. A strong correlation (rs=0.804, p<0.0001)) has been observed between these two assays. When compared with NCP-ELISA, S1 slightly better correlation (rs=0.800, p<0.0001) than RBD (rs=0.740, p<0.0001).

The patients had multiple concomitant disorders: hypertension (6), heart failure (4), diabetes (4), obesity (4), coronary heart disease (3), chronic kidney disease (3), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3), anemia (3). Positive UAT was obtained at admission in 4 patients, and on 3rd, 11th and 14th days of hospitalization in the remaining 3 patients. One patient also had positive UAT for Streptococcus pneumoniae. We analyzed: radiological imaging, laboratory data (CRP, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, troponin I, BNP), ECG, echocardiography, treatment and outcome. Three patients required a modification of initial antibiotic therapy, two developed Clostridioides difficile infection.

METHODS Planned post hoc analysis using patients from a previous randomized controlled study. Fiberoptic tracheoscopy was performed during the 24 h following extubation. In patients with >2 ischemic lesions, ulcer or tracheal rupture, fiberoptic tracheoscopy was repeated 2 weeks after the last extubation. Tracheal ischemic lesions were predefined based on a quantitative score. RESULTS Ninety-six adult patients were included in this study. Eighty (83 %) patients had at least one tracheal ischemic lesion. Thirty-seven (38 %) patients had a tracheal ischemia score > median score (5; IQ 1, 7). The most common tracheal ischemic lesion was ischemia (68 %), followed by hyperemia (54 %), ulcer (10 %), and tracheal rupture (1 %). Univariate analysis identified duration of neuromuscular-blocking agent use, overinflation of tracheal cuff (>30 cmH2O), percentage of P cuff determination >30 cmH2O, duration of assist-control ventilation, and plateau pressure as risk factors for having a tracheal ischemia score >5. Duration of assist-control mechanical ventilation was the only factor independently associated with tracheal ischemia score >5 [OR (95 % CI) 1.10 per hour (1.02-1.20)].

Venous sinus stenosis has been identified in select patients, leading to stenting as a potential treatment, but its effects on global ICP have not been completely defined. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of venous sinus stenting on ICP in a small group of patients with IIH. METHODS Ten patients for whom medical therapy had failed were prospectively followed. Ophthalmological examinations were assessed, and patients with venous sinus stenosis on MR angiography proceeded to catheter angiography, venography with assessment of pressure gradient, and ICP monitoring. Patients with elevated ICP measurements and an elevated pressure gradient across the stenosis were treated with stent placement. RESULTS All patients had elevated venous pressure (mean 39.5  14.9 mm Hg), an elevated gradient across the venous sinus stenosis (30.0  13.2 mm Hg), and elevated ICP (42.2  15.9 mm Hg). Following stent placement, all patients had resolution of the stenosis and gradient (1  1 mm Hg). The ICP values showed an immediate decrease (to a mean of 17.0  8.3 mm Hg), and further decreased overnight (to a mean of 8  4.2 mm Hg). All patients had subjective and objective improvement, and all but one improved during follow-up (median 23.4 months; range 15.7-31.6 months). Two patients developed stent-adjacent stenosis; retreatment abolished the stenosis and gradient in both cases. Patients presenting with papilledema had resolution on follow-up funduscopic imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) and improvement on visual field testing. Patients presenting with optic atrophy had optic nerve thinning on follow-up OCT, but improved visual fields. CONCLUSIONS For selected patients with IIH and venous sinus stenosis with an elevated pressure gradient and elevated ICP, venous sinus stenting results in resolution of the venous pressure gradient, reduction in ICP, and functional, neurological, and ophthalmological improvement. As patients are at risk for stent-adjacent stenosis, further follow-up is necessary to determine long-term outcomes and gain an understanding of venous sinus stenosis as a primary or secondary pathological process behind elevated ICP.","output":"Venous sinus stenting for reduction of intracranial pressure in IIH: a prospective pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has upended lives and thrown the taken for granted into disarray One of the most affected groups were teachers and students, faced with the necessity of school closures and-where logistically feasible-an urgent shift to emergency remote instruction, often with little prior notice In this contribution, based on an online survey involving participants from 91 countries, we offer a perspective bridging the two groups, by investigating the role of teachers' demographics and professional adaptation to emergency remote teaching in their perception of how their students were coping with the novel situation The resultant model explains 51% of variance, and highlights the relative weights of the predictor variables Given the importance of teacher perceptions in the effectiveness of their instruction, the findings may offer valuable guidelines for future training and intervention programs","output":"Teachers' Perception of Student Coping With Emergency Remote Instruction During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Relative Impact of Educator Demographics and Professional Adaptation and Adjustment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Mitigation behaviors are key to preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Result demonstrated the nanoMIP-non optimized nanogratings showed superior performance with respect to the ultra-thin MIP-optimized nanogratings. The peculiar deformable character of the nano-MIPs enabled to significantly enhance the limit of detection (LOD) of the plasmonic bio/sensor, allowing the detection of the low femtomolar concentration of analyte (LOD  3 fM), thus outpassing of four orders of magnitude the sensitivies achieved so far on optimized nano-patterned plasmonic platforms functionalized with ultra-thin MIP layers.

As a general consideration, the combination of more plasmonic transducers to different kinds of MIP receptors is discussed as a mean to attain the detection range for the selected application field.","output":"On the Effect of Soft Molecularly Imprinted Nanoparticles Receptors Combined to Nanoplasmonic Probes for Biomedical Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 virus vaccination is under process for adaptive immunity.

Incomplete excision is an important predictor of local recurrence after rectal cancer surgery. Transanal TME (TaTME) is a new treatment option in which the rectum is approached with both laparoscopic and transanal endoscopic techniques. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and localisation of residual mesorectal tissue by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and compare this between TaTME and laparoscopic TME (LapTME) patients. In addition, we assessed correspondence with histopathological quality. METHODS Two groups of patients with cT1-T3 rectal cancer who underwent TME surgery with primary anastomosis were included, each group consisting of 32 patients. Postoperative T2-weighted MRI of the pelvis was performed at least 6 months after TME surgery and evaluated by two radiologists independently. Residual mesorectum was defined as any residual mesorectal tissue detectable after TME. Localisation of the tissue was categorised in relation to height in the pelvis and position of the level of anastomosis. RESULTS Residual mesorectal tissue was detected in 3.1% of TaTME patients and of 46.9% in LapTME patients (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified only type of surgery as a significant risk factor for leaving residual mesorectum. Other known risk factors for incomplete TME, such as body mass index (BMI) and male gender, were not significant. No relation was seen between specimen quality and prevalence of residual mesorectum. CONCLUSIONS The completeness of mesorectal excision was significantly better with TaTME than with standard laparoscopic technique.","output":"Residual mesorectum on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging following transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LapTME) in rectal cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory disease that is caused by a novel coronavirus and was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China The disease is highly infectious, and its main clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue, myalgia, and dyspnea Healthcare providers are in front in fighting the coronavirus spread by making themselves the risk of contracting the disease Objective: To assess the preparedness and responses of healthcare providers to combat the spread of COVID-19 among North Shewa Zone Hospitals, Amhara, Ethiopia Methods: Facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020 among 422 healthcare providers in the North Shewa Zone, Amhara, Ethiopia using a self-administered questionnaire Study subjects were selected through systematic random sampling based on their proportional distribution of sample size to each hospital A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data The data were coded and entered into the Epi data 4 2 1 version and the analysis was carried out in Statistical Package for Social Science 25 versions Results: Four hundred four participants involved in the study have been given a response rate of 95 7% The self-satisfaction of healthcare providers revealed 301 (74 5%) of study participants feel unsafe in their workplace Two-third, 260 (64 4%), of them responded that they feel anxious while working with febrile patients Nearly one-third (31%), 27 4%, 15 9%, 14 5%, 14 2% of HCPs had access to gloves, facemask, goggle, shoe, and apron respectively in hospitals Conclusion: Protecting healthcare workers is a public health priority Access to essential personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic was limited The poor perception of healthcare professionals about not having enough support from medical institutions and public health authorities raises the need to urgently implement strategies to protect healthcare workers in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Preparedness and Responses of Healthcare Providers to Combat the Spread of COVID-19 Among North Shewa Zone Hospitals, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses silently circulate in human and animal populations, causing mild to severe diseases.

Emerging evidence suggests that mindfulness practices may reduce stress from discrimination and improve overall well-being among young SGM. Moreover, the omnipresence of smartphone access among racial or ethnic and sexual minority communities provides a method through which to administer mindfulness-based interventions among young SGMs of color. OBJECTIVE: This paper outlines the protocol of the Optimizing a Daily Mindfulness Intervention to Reduce Stress from Discrimination among Young Sexual and Gender Minorities of Color (REDUCE) study, a pilot optimization trial of a smartphone-based mindfulness intervention that was developed in conjunction with the Healthy Minds Program (HMP) with the aim of reducing stress from discrimination among young SGMs. METHODS: In total, 80 young (ages 18-29 years) SGMs of color will be enrolled in the study. The HMP is a self-guided meditation practice, and participants will be randomized to either a control condition or an intervention that uses a neuroscience-based approach to mindfulness. We will use the multiphase optimization strategy to assess which combination of mindfulness interventions is the most effective at reducing stress from discrimination among young SGMs of color. A combination of mindfulness-based meditation intervention components will be examined, comprising mindfulness-based practices of awareness, connection, and purpose. Awareness refers to the practice of self-awareness, which reduces the minds ability to be distracted and instead be present in the moment. Connection refers to the practice of connection with oneself and others and emphasizes on empathy and compassion with oneself and others. Purpose encourages goal-making in accordance with ones values and management of behavior in accordance with these goals. In addition, we will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the HMP application among young SGMs of color. RESULTS: The REDUCE study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of New York University, and recruitment and enrollment began in the winter of 2021. We expect to complete enrollment by the summer of 2022. The results will be disseminated via social media, journal articles, abstracts, or presentations, as well as to participants, who will be given the opportunity to provide feedback to the researchers. CONCLUSIONS: This optimization trial is designed to test the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of implementing an application-based, mindfulness-based intervention to reduce stress from discrimination and improve well-being among young SGMs of color.

This ligand-based pharmacophore implicates a possible common target or mechanism that could be further explored. A recent structure based design project yielded nine co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors bound to the viral protein 35 (VP35). When receptor-ligand pharmacophores based on the analogs of these molecules and the protein structures were constructed, the molecular features partially overlapped with the common features of solely ligand-based pharmacophore models based on FDA approved drugs. These previously identified FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were therefore docked into this protein. The antimalarials chloroquine and amodiaquine docked favorably in VP35.

In conclusion, it is observed that Bitcoin can be ideal for financial diversification for global investors and take its place in the markets as a new virtual gold.","output":"Covid -19 Srecinde Alt?n ve Petrol Fiyatlar?n?n Bitcoin zerindeki Asimetrik Etkisi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There has been limited data on the influence of sex on development of thrombosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CLOT-COVID Study was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study enrolling 2894 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 among 16 centers in Japan from April 2021 to September 2021. We divided the entire cohort into the men (N = 1885) and women (N = 1009) groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in D-dimer levels at admission between men and women. Men had more severe status of the COVID-19 at admission compared with women (Mild: 57% versus 66%, Moderate: 34% versus 29%, and Severe: 9.1% versus 5.7%, P < 0.001). Men more often received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis than women (47% versus 35%, P < 0.001). During the hospitalization, men more often developed thrombosis than women (2.5% [95%CI, 1.9C3.3%] versus 0.8% [95%CI, 0.4C1.6%], P = 0.001). Men had numerically higher incidences of thrombosis than women in all subgroups of the worst severity of COVID-19 during the hospitalization (Mild: 0.3% versus 0.0%, Moderate: 1.6% versus 1.0%, and Severe: 11.1% versus 4.3%). Even after adjusting confounders in the multivariable logistic regression model, the excess risk of men relative to women remained significant for thrombosis (adjusted OR, 2.51; 95%CI, 1.16C5.43, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In the current large observational study of patients with COVID-19, men had more severe status of the COVID-19 than women, and the risk of development of thrombosis was higher in men compared with women, which could be helpful in determining the patient-specific optimal management strategies for COVID-19.","output":"Influence of sex on development of thrombosis in patients with COVID-19: From the CLOT-COVID study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused both unprecendented disruptions and massive changes to education.

Various epidemiological, statistical, and laboratory-based studies have shown that the role of temperature and other environmental factors has important influence in the transmission of coronaviruses. Scientific research is needed to answer the questions about the spread and transmission of the infection, whether people could be avoided from being infected with COVID-19 in next summer. AIM: We aim to investigate the association of daily average temperature, daily average dew point, daily average humidity, daily average wind speed, and daily average pressure with the infection caused by this novel coronavirus in Pakistan. KEY FINDINGS: First, we check the correlation between environmental factors and daily infected cases of COVID-19; among them, temperature and dew point have positive linear relationship with daily infected cases of COVID-19. The thought-provoking findings of the present study suggested that higher temperature and dew point can contribute to a rise in COVID-19 disease in four provinces of Pakistan, possible to genome modifications and viral resistance to harsh environment. Moreover, it is also observed that humidity in Punjab and Sindh, and wind speed in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have influenced the spreading of daily infected COVID-19 cases.

Materials and Methods: Out of 167 vaccinated patients, 136 agreed to a follow-up visit three to six weeks after vaccination. Results: Only 39 patients (29%) developed antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 (35.2 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL) after full vaccination. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that predictive factors for good antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccine were better kidney function, higher hemoglobin level, and no use of mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppression. For seropositive kidney transplant patients there was a significant negative correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer and CD4/CD8 ratio (Spearmans correlation coefficient ?0.4, p = 0.02), percentage of CD19+ cells (r = ?0.37, p = 0.02), and a positive correlation with percentage of CD8+ cells (r = 0.4, p = 0.01). There was an increase of total leucocyte count after vaccination in the total studied population, and in the group of responders. Conclusions: Only one third of kidney transplant patients develop sufficient antibody responses after full COVID-19 vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech.

While most GIS work on Covid-19 testing coverage and access has used census tract or ZIP code aggregated data, this manuscript is unique in that it uses individual level demographics and exact addresses to calculate distances actually traveled by patients. Methods: : We used testing data recorded for 9,721 patients at 20 sites operating in May-June 2020. The dataset includes detailed age, race and ethnicity, and testing results as well as the exact address of each individual. Using GIS, we estimated changes in testing coverage for minority neighborhoods and calculated the actual distance covered by individuals. Logistic regression and multivariate linear regression were used to identify socio-demographic variables associated with distance travelled to and used of nearest testing site. We used a secondary dataset from drive-through sites to evaluate change in coverage at the census tract level for the metropolitan area. Results: : Walk-up sites significantly increased testing availability in New Orleans, and specifically in minority neighborhoods. Both African Americans and Asians were more likely (14.7% and 53.0%) to be tested at the nearest walk-up site. They also covered shorter distances to get tested. Being elderly was also significantly and positively associated with testing at the nearest site. Hispanics, however, were not associated with increased proximity to and use of nearest sites, and they traveled an additional 0.745 km to get tested. Individuals who tested positive also travelled significantly longer distances to obtain a test. Conclusions: : Walk-up sites increased testing availability for some vulnerable populations who took advantage of the sites proximity, although inequalities appear at the metropolitan scale. As cities are planning community vaccination campaigns, mobile, walk-up sites appear to improve both coverage and accessibility for hard-to-reach populations. With adequate technical (vaccine dose refrigeration) and messaging (addressing reticence to immunization) adaptations, they could constitute a key complementary approach to health facility points of delivery.","output":"Is Covid-19 community level testing effective in reaching at-risk populations?

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the evidence regarding the value of whole-body CT (WBCT) as part of the primary survey, in comparison to conventional radiological procedures. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search of the literature was conducted using keywords applied in Scopus, Cochrane and PubMed databases. Articles were eligible if they contained original data comparing the use of WBCT in the primary survey, with conventional radiological procedures. Outcomes included overall and 24a?-h mortality, emergency department (ED) time, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome/failure (MODS/MOF) incidence. Radiation dose, mechanical ventilation duration and cost were evaluated qualitatively. Analysis was performed with Covidence, MedCalc Version 19.1.3. and Meta-Essentials. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included. Statistical pooling demonstrated comparable rates between conventional procedures and WBCT (ORa?=a?0.854, CIa?=a?0.715-1.021, pa?=a?0.083) in 63,529 patients across 11 studies. A significant finding favouring WBCT was discovered for ED time (SMD = -0.709, CI -1.198 to -0.220, pa?=a?0.004). Patients experienced similar 24a?-h mortality rates (pa?=a?0.450), MODS/MOF incidence (pa?=a?0.274), and hospital (pa?=a?0.541) and ICU LOS (pa?=a?0.457). WBCT is associated with increased radiation dose and mechanical ventilation duration. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates that WBCT markedly reduces time spent in ED. No significant differences in mortality rate are suggested. WBCT currently entails greater radiation dose and mechanical ventilation time.

Vehicle-mounted CCTVs are used to inspect the inside and outside of the site non-face-to-face, as inspection materials such as steel frames, steel towers, and small and medium-sized dense sites are difficult to access or require a lot of manpower. Results: The contents of the inspection are analyzed through a modeling program, and the results are shared with the competent front-line agencies and construction sites through cloud and mobile. Through this, a wide range of on-site inspections are possible, and real-time data scales enable timely adaptation to dangerous sites. Furthermore, through the operation of the pilot site, a manual that can use drones for safety and health technology guidance projects will be produced and distributed and expanded to front-line institutions.

Infection poses an increased threat of severity to at-risk populations including those with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), is characterized, in part, by insulin insensitivity and impaired glucose regulation. T2DM patients have increased disease severity and poorer outcomes with COVID-19. We utilized the diet-induced obesity (DIO) model of Type 2 Diabetes in SARS-CoV-2-susceptible K18-hACE2 transgenic mice to better understand the obesity co-morbidity. Female DIO, but not male DIO mice challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were observed to have shortened time to morbidity compared to normal diet mice. Increase in susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 in female DIO was associated with increased total viral RNA burden compared to male mice. RNAseq analysis was performed on the lungs of non-challenged, challenged, females, males, of either normal diet or DIO cohorts to determine the disease specific transcriptional profiles. DIO female mice had more total activated genes than normal diet mice after challenge; however, male mice experienced a decrease. GO term analysis revealed the DIO condition increased interferon response signatures and interferon gamma production following challenge. Male challenged mice had robust expression of antibody-related genes suggesting antibody producing cell localization in the lung. DIO reduced antibody gene expression in challenged males.

METHODS: We reviewed a total of 307 VFs performed with a face mask (FPP2/KN95 or surgical masks) and compared them with prior VFs, performed before the pandemic. VFs with suspected pseudoprogression due to mask artefacts (VF test 1) were repeated with a surgical mask and an adhesive tape on its superior border (VF test 2) to distinguish from true VF loss. Several parameters including reliability indices, test duration, VF index (VFI), mean defect (MD) and pattern deviation probability plots were compared among last pre-COVID VFs, VF tests 1 and VF tests 2, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: We identified 18 VFs with suspected progression artefact due to masks (5.8%). In all of them, the median VFI and MD significantly improved after fitting the superior border of the mask, showing no significant differences with pre-COVID tests. The median fixation losses were significantly higher when wearing the unfitted mask (13% vs 6%,p=0.047). The inferior hemifield was the most affected, either as a new scotoma or as an enlargement of a prior defect. CONCLUSION: Unfitted masks can simulate VF progression in around 6% of cases, mainly in the inferior hemifield, and increase significantly the rate of fixation losses. A similar rate of artefacts was observed using FPP2/KN95 or surgical masks. The use of a surgical mask with an adhesive tape covering the superior border may reduce mask-related artefacts, although concomitant progression cannot be ruled out in all cases.","output":"Avoiding mask-related artefacts in visual field tests during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Techniques for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (RP) have been carefully reviewed by surgical teams worldwide in order to identify possible weaknesses and facilitate further improvement in their overall performance.

The present study sought to assess whether phenotypes can be derived from intensive care patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to assess the correlation with prognosis, and to develop a parsimonious model for phenotype identification. Methods: Adult patients with COVID-19 from Tongji hospital between January 2020 and March 2020 were included. The consensus k means clustering and latent class analysis (LCA) were applied to identify phenotypes using 26 clinical variables. We then employed machine learning algorithms to select a maximum of five important classifier variables, which were further used to establish a nested logistic regression model for phenotype identification. Results: Both consensus k means clustering and LCA showed that a two-phenotype model was the best fit for the present cohort (N = 504). A total of 182 patients (36.1%) were classified as hyperactive phenotype, who exhibited a higher 28-day mortality and higher rates of organ dysfunction than did those in hypoactive phenotype.

Anxiety levels and risk factors within particular populations are poorly described. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate confidence, understanding, trust, concerns, and levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population and assess risk factors for increased anxiety. METHODS: We launched a cross-sectional online survey of a large Russian population between April 6 and 15, 2020, using multiple social media platforms. A set of questions targeted confidence, understanding, trust, and concerns in respondents. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure anxiety. Multiple linear regressions were used to model predictors of COVID-19Crelated anxiety. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 23,756 out of 53,966 (44.0% response rate) unique visitors; of which, 21,364 were residing in 62 areas of Russia. State Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety) scores were higher than Trait Anxiety Scale scores across all regions of Russia (median S-Anxiety score 52, IQR 44-60), exceeding published norms. Time spent following news on COVID-19 was strongly associated with an increased S-Anxiety adjusted for baseline anxiety level. One to two hours spent reading COVID-19 news was associated with a 5.46 (95% CI 5.03-5.90) point difference, 2-3 hours with a 7.06 (95% CI 6.37-7.74) point difference, and more than three hours with an 8.65 (95% CI 7.82-9.47) point difference, all compared to less than 30 minutes per day. Job loss during the pandemic was another important factor associated with higher S-Anxiety scores (3.95, 95% CI 3.31-4.58). Despite survey respondents reporting high confidence in information regarding COVID-19 as well as an understanding of health care guidance, they reported low overall trust in state and local authorities, and perception of country readiness. CONCLUSIONS: Among Russian respondents from multiple social media platforms, there was evidence of higher levels of state anxiety associated with recent job loss and increased news consumption, as well as lower than expected trust in government agencies. These findings can help inform the development of key public health messages to help reduce anxiety and raise perceived trust in governmental response to this current national emergency. Using a similar methodology, comparative surveys are ongoing in other national populations.","output":"Excessive Media Consumption About COVID-19 is Associated With Increased State Anxiety: Outcomes of a Large Online Survey in Russia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 spread all over the world becoming a pandemic illness, researchers have better characterized route of virus transmissibility and clinical signs and symptoms of the disease.

Although there is no complete treatment protocol for COVID-19, studies on this topic are ongoing, and it is known that broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins are used for coinfections and symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Studies have shown that Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria can cause symptoms such as diarrhea and coinfections accompanying COVID-19. Therefore, in this study, colon-targeted cefaclor monohydrate (CEF)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-Eudragit S100 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared using a nanoprecipitation technique. The particle sizes of the CEF-loaded NPs were between 171.4 and 198.8 nm. The encapsulation efficiency was in the range of 58.4%-81.2%. With dissolution studies, it has been concluded that formulations prepared with Eudragit S100 (E-coded) and Eudragit S100+PLGA (EP-coded) are pH-sensitive formulations and they are targetable to the colon, whereas the formulation prepared only with PLGA (P-coded) can release a higher CEF rate in the colon owing to the slow release properties of PLGA. The release kinetics were fitted to the Korsmeyer-Peppas and Weibull models. The antibacterial activity of E-, EP-, and P-coded formulations was 16-fold, 16-fold, and 2-fold higher than CEF, respectively, for S. aureus and E. coli according to the microdilution results. As a result of the time killing experiment, all formulations prepared were found to be more effective than the antibiotic itself for long periods.

The stigma associated with pain and opioid use has made it difficult for those with SCD to obtain needed treatment for pain, which can be acute or chronic, and nociceptive or neuropathic in nature. Given these difficulties, coupled with the inconsistency of opioids in successfully treating chronic and neuropathic pain, there is a need for non-opioid alternatives to treat this increasingly recognized subset of patients with SCD. Topical capsaicin for neuropathic pain has been studied extensively in adults with comparable efficacy to gabapentinoids, but it has not been investigated for SCD-related pain. We investigated the safety and feasibility of high dose (8%) topical capsaicin for treatment of neuropathic pain in children with SCD. The primary objective was to assess drug safety. Secondary objectives were to assess the feasibility and optimal utilization strategy of various measures of neuropathic and chronic pain states, and to obtain preliminary efficacy data. Prior to this study there has been very little published data regarding quantitative sensory testing as a trended datapoint to assess therapeutic effect on neuropathic pain. Methods Patients between ages 14-21 years with SCD and reported symptoms of neuropathic pain were included. During each of 7 visits scheduled at 6 week intervals, mechanical quantitative sensory testing (QST) was conducted using an electronic von Frey instrument (Bioseb) at a control site (thenar eminence) and the two most common sites of vaso-occlusive pain as reported at enrollment. Participants also completed the PainDETECT? questionnaire (Pfizer) for neuropathic pain assessment. During visits 1, 3, and 5 an 8% capsaicin patch was applied to the previously established most common site of pain. Safety was evaluated via CTCAE based analysis of adverse events in real time and at study completion. Efficacy was primarily evaluated by improvement in mechanical pain threshold at the site of most frequent pain (treated with capsaicin) relative to the 2nd most common site of pain (not treated). Trends in PainDetect scores also contributed to a preliminary understanding of capsaicin efficacy. Results 10 out of 13 patients approached (5 male, 5 female) were enrolled as planned within 8 weeks. 9 participants completed visits 1-5, and 7 completed visit 6 prior to study suspension due to COVID restrictions. There were no CTCAE grade 3 adverse events attributable to capsaicin. There were no vaso-occlusive pain crises triggered by a patch application. One participant requested that the second patch be removed early due to intolerance of the burning sensation associated with the patch. She subsequently did not have the third patch applied at visit 5. All participants were informed at enrollment of the likelihood of this side effect, which was nearly universal among participants but generally well tolerated. The other 9 participants completed all possible study activities and felt the second patch application was more tolerable than the first. 6 participants felt after 2 treatments the treated area was no longer their most common site of pain. These subjective reports were supported by more objective measures. The average difference in pain threshold as measured by QST between the two painful sites (QSTTreated - QSTuntreated) was used to evaluate a beneficial effect of capsaicin. This difference from visit 1 to visit 5 changed from -31.94g to +11.51g over the first 5 visits for an average improvement in pain threshold at the treated site relative to the untreated site of +43.45g (p=0.02) (Fig. 1), indicating that by visit 5 the threshold was higher at the treated site than the untreated site, a reversal from visit 1. Statistical analysis could not be completed for subsequent visits due to incomplete datasets. Conclusion Our pilot study indicates 8% topical capsaicin is safe and feasible for children with SCD. The data indicates this therapy may be efficacious in a eliorating neuropathic pain for this population and warrants further investigation in a follow-up efficacy study to be initiated in the coming months. The initial negative difference in QST values and subsequent trends between the two sites coincided with patient reported relative pain severity and supports the potential of QST as a tool in trending medication effect on peripheral hypersensitivity.

Specifically, energy-based devices and lasers require special consideration, as they may emit plume which has been shown to contain tissue debris and aerosolized biological materials. Prior studies have shown transmission of viruses and bacteria via plume (i.e., HIV and papillomavirus). The purpose of this study was to evaluate plume characteristics of the Er:YAG resurfacing laser (Sciton; Palo Alto, CA) and compare it to the Morpheus8 fractional radiofrequency device (InMode; Lake Forest, CA). METHODS: Five patients who underwent aesthetic resurfacing and/or skin tightening of the face and neck were treated with the Er:YAG (Sciton Joule, Palo Alto, CA) and/or fractional radiofrequency (Morpheus8, Lake Forest, CA) between April 1 and May 11, 2020. Data collected included patient demographics, past medical history, treatment parameters, adverse events, particle counter data, as well as high magnification video equiptment. Patients were evaluated during treatment with a calibrated particle meter (PCE; Jupiter, FL). The particle meter was used at a consistent focal distance (6-12 inches) to sample the surrounding environment during treatment at 2.83 L/min to a counting efficiency of 50% at 0.3 m and 100% at >0.45 m. Recordings were obtained with and without a smoke evacuator. RESULTS: Of our cohort (n = 5), average age was 58 years old (STD 7.2). Average Fitzpatrick type was between 2 and 3. Two patients received Er:YAG fractional resurfacing in addition to fractional radiofrequency during the same treatment session. Two patients had fractional radiofrequency only, and one patient had laser treatment with the Er:YAG only. There were no adverse events recorded. The particle counter demonstrated ambient baseline particles/second (pps) at 8 (STD 6). During fractional radiofrequency treatment at 1-mm depth, the mean recording was 8 pps (STD 8). At the more superficial depth of 0.5 mm, recordings showed 10 pps (STD 6). The Er:YAG laser resurfacing laser had mean readings of 44 pps (STD 11). When the particle sizes were broken down by size, the fractional radiofrequency device had overall smaller particle sizes with a count of 251 for 0.3 m (STD 147) compared with Er:YAG laser with a count of 112 for 0.3 m (STD 84). The fractional radiofrequency did not appear to emit particles >5 m throughout the treatment, however, the Er:YAG laser consistently recorded majority of particles in the range of 5-10 m. The addition of the smoke evacuator demonstrated a 50% reduction in both particles per second recorded as well as all particle sizes. CONCLUSION: Re-evaluation of the plume effect from aesthetic devices has become important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies are required to characterize viability of COVID-19 viability and transmissibility in plume specimens. Based on this pilot study, we recommend that devices that generate little to no plume such as fractional radiofrequency devices be used in Phase I reopening of practice while devices that generate a visible plume such as Er:YAG laser resurfacing devices be avoided and only used with appropriate personal protective equipment in addition to a smoke evacuator in Phase IV reopening.","output":"Plume Effect of Fractional Radiofrequency Verus Laser Resurfacing: Considerations in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) improves clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by a large vessel occlusion. However, it is not known whether intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is of added benefit in patients undergoing MT. Objective To examine whether treatment with IVT before MT with a stent retriever is beneficial in patients undergoing MT. Design, Setting, and Participants This post hoc analysis used data from 291 patients treated with MT included in 2 large, multicenter, prospective clinical trials that evaluated MT for AIS (Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy performed from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2011, and Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2012). An independent core laboratory scored the radiologic outcomes in each trial. Interventions Patients were treated with IVT with tissue plasminogen activator followed by MT (IVT and MT group) with the use of a stent retriever or MT with a stent retriever alone (MT group). Main Outcomes and Measures Successful reperfusion, functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2) and mortality at 90 days, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, emboli to new territory, and vasospasm were compared. Results Of 291 patients included in the analysis, 160 (55.0%) underwent IVT and MT (mean [SD] age, 67 [13] years; 97 female [60.6%]), and 131 (45.0%) underwent MT alone (mean [SD] age, 69 [12] years; 71 [55.7%] female). Median Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score at baseline was lower in the IVT and MT group (8 vs 9, P = .04). There was no statistically significant difference in the duration from symptom onset to groin puncture (254 minutes for the IVT and MT group vs 262 minutes for the MT group, P = .10). The number of passes, rate of successful reperfusion, functional independence at 90 days, mortality at 90 days, and emboli to new territory were also similar among groups. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (1% vs 4%) and parenchymal hemorrhages type 1 (1% vs 3%) or type 2 (1% vs 2%) did not differ significantly (P = .25). Vasospasm occurred more often in patients who received IVT and MT vs MT alone (27% vs 14%, P = .006). In multivariate analysis, no statistically significant association was observed between IVT and MT vs MT alone for any of the outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance The results indicate that treatment of patients experiencing AIS due to a large vessel occlusion with IVT before MT does not appear to provide a clinical benefit over MT alone.

At present, the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases and new deaths is increasing worldwide. The strategy of comprehensive and scientific detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) through real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for special populations and environments provides great support for the prevention and control of this pandemic in China. Our study focused on determining the factors associated with the length of time from symptom onset to the first positive nucleic acid test of throat swabs in COVID-19 patients, evaluating the effect of early positive nucleic acid detection on the disease severity and its significance in prognosis, and predicting the factors associated with the time from positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test to negative conversion in COVID-19 patients. Methods This study included 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from January 30, 2020 to March 4, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Throat swabs samples were collected for real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and all patients included in this study were positive for this test. Results Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed that disease severity and the duration of disease before admission to hospitals were protective factors for the time from symptom onset to positive nucleic acid detection, and the time from positive nucleic acid test to negative conversion was a risk factor for the time from symptom onset to positive nucleic acid detection. Meanwhile, the time from symptom onset to positive nucleic acid detection was an independent risk factor for the prolonged negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Conclusions Patients with more severe disease and longer duration of disease before admission to hospitals had a shorter time from symptom onset to positive nucleic acid test. Prolonged time from symptom onset to positive nucleic acid test was an independent risk factor for the prolonged negative conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the severity of the disease had no correlation with negative conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"The value of early positive nucleic acid test and negative conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Persistence of breathlessness after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is frequent. Recovery from acute respiratory failure (ARF) is usually determined by normalized arterial blood gases (ABGs), but the prevalence of persistent exercise-induced desaturation (EID) and dyspnea is still unknown. METHODS: We investigated the prevalence of EID in 70 patients with normal arterial oxygen at rest after recovery from ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients underwent a 6-min walking test (6MWT) before discharge from hospital. We recorded dyspnea score and heart rate during 6MWT. We also investigated the possible role of lung ultrasound (LU) in predicting EID. Patients underwent a LU scan and scores for each explored area were summed to give a total LU score. RESULTS: In 30 patients (43%), oxygen desaturation was >4% during 6MWT. These patients had significantly higher dyspnea and heart rate compared to non-desaturators. LU score >8.5 was significantly able to discriminate patients with EID. CONCLUSION: In SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, ABGs at discharge cannot predict the persistence of EID, which is frequent. LU may be useful to identify patients at risk who could benefit from a rehabilitation program.","output":"Prevalence of exercise-induced oxygen desaturation after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and use of lung ultrasound to predict need for pulmonary rehabilitation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The three pillars of Indias foreign policy strategy under an overarching preference for strategic autonomy are security, economic development, and status.

We assessed the magnitude of the outbreak and the role students and staff played using a self-administered antibody detection test and survey. METHODS: The school was closed on March 13, and the entire community was placed under quarantine. We implemented a home-delivery, self-administered, IgG/IgM antibody test and survey to a classroom stratified sample of students and all staff from May 4-19. We aimed to determine overall seroprevalence rates by age group, reported symptoms, contact exposure and to explore dynamics of transmission. RESULTS: Antibody positivity rates were 9.9% (95%CI: 8.2-11.8) for 1,009 students and 16.6% (95%CI: 12.1-21.9) for 235 staff. Among students, positivity was associated with younger age (P=0.01), lower grade level (P=0.05), prior RT-PCR positivity (P=0.03), and history of contact with a confirmed case (P<0.001). Among staff, positivity was higher in teachers (P=0.01) and in those previously RT-PCR positive (P<0.001). Excluding RT-PCR positive individuals, antibody positivity was associated with fever in adults and children (P=0.02; P=0.002), abdominal pain in children (P=0.001), and chest pain in adults (P=0.02). Within antibody positive individuals, 40% of students and 18% of staff reported no symptoms (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Teachers were more affected during the outbreak and younger children were at higher infection risk, likely because index case(s) were teachers and/or parents from preschool.

We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression.","output":"An electroencephalographic signature predicts antidepressant response in major depression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Indigenous peoples in Canada and in the Circumpolar North face a higher disease burden leading to end-stage organ failure and face geographic and systemic barriers to accessing health-care services, including those for end-stage organ failure and organ donation and transplantation (ODT).

Methods, Results & Conclusion: A Xeno-Free (XF), fed-batch, microcarrier-based bioreactor process for hMSC manufacturing had been developed and optimized [1], and scaled to a 50L process, with demonstrated comparability between the hMSC critical quality attributes (CQAs) from the bioreactor process and from 2D control cells of similar population doubling (PDL) [2]. Based on this previous process development, GenCure and RoosterBio are leading the first stage of biomanufacturing through upstream (2D seed train & bioreactor expansion) and downstream process (continuous counterflow centrigufation, formulation & fill, and cryopreservation). Bioreactor runs at the 50 L scale were performed using the most commonly used hMSC sources in regenerative medicine: bone marrow (BM-MSCs), umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) and adipose (AD-MSCs). Critical process parameters (CPPs) are defined and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the harvested cell product are characterized. An initial production run produced over 33billion BM-MSCs that passed the ISCT minimal criteria for MSCs. The subsequent expansion of UC- and AD-MSCs will be presented. Sentien's proprietary platform was used to ask questions on how the MSCs reacted to different stimuli with results showing that BM-MSCs were able to sense and respond with different secretomes to inflammatory stimuli. Our data also showed that BMMSCs induced changes in CD4, CD8 and CD19 cells and significantly reduced TNF-a levels in activated PBMCs, demonstrating their immunomodulatory capabilities. The same assays will be performed using the resulting MSCs from umbilical cord and adipose tissue expanded in the 50L bioreactor. Sentien, which has treated 16 subjects with acute kidney injury (AKI, open IND) and is currently running a trial in severe COVID-19 patients with AKI, will contribute biomarker data from the clinical-scale bioreactor and patient samples. Testing the in vitro developed potency hypothesis against the clinical samples will form the basis of a true potency assay.

Whitu (meaning 7 in the New Zealand Mori language Te Reo) is a newly developed well-being app with 7 modules that support young people to learn and practice evidence-based coping skills, including relaxation, mindfulness, self-compassion, and goal-setting. OBJECTIVE: During this pilot, we explored the acceptability, usability, and preliminary efficacy of Whitu before refining the app for a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: We recruited 20 New Zealand young people aged 16-25 years via social media to trial the first prototype of the Whitu app over 6 weeks. Within-group differences from baseline to 2- and 6-weeks post intervention in self-reported well-being, depression, anxiety, stress, self-compassion, optimism and sleep quality were evaluated using repeated-measures ANOVA. A further 21 participants aged 16-30 years were recruited to participate in 4 focus groups to give feedback on the app's usability and cultural acceptability. Feedback was analysed using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in anxiety (p = 0.024) and stress (p = 0.017) were observed from baseline to 2-weeks post intervention. Improvements in well-being (p = 0.021), depression (p = 0.031), anxiety (p = 0.005), and stress (p = 0.004) were also observed from baseline to 6-weeks. No statistically significant changes were seen in self-compassion, optimism, or sleep quality. Effect sizes (partial (2)s) ranged from 0.25 (depression) to 0.42 (stress). Qualitative feedback comprised of five key themes, namely: factors affecting engagement, issues with functionality, preferences regarding aesthetics, effectiveness and adverse effects, and cultural acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that Whitu may be an effective app for improving multiple dimensions of young people's well-being.

During the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, LUS was propagated as a useful instrument in triage and monitoring. We evaluated LUS as a rapid diagnostic triage tool for the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: The study retrospectively enrolled patients with suspected COVID-19, who were admitted from 1st April to 25th of April 2020 to the ED of a tertiary care center in Germany. During clinical work-up, patients underwent LUS and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. The recorded ultrasound findings were analyzed and judged regarding typical signs of viral pneumonia, blinded for clinical information of the patients. The results were compared with PCR test and chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: 2236 patients were treated in the ED during the study period. 203 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using PCR, 135 (66.5%) underwent LUS and 39 (28.9%) of the patients were examined by chest CT scan. 39 (28.9%) of the 135 patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR. In 52 (38.5%) COVID-19 was suspected from the finding of the LUS, resulting in a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 77.1% compared with PCR results. The negative predictive value reached 89.2%. The findings of the LUS had - compared to a positive chest CT scan for COVID-19 - a sensitivity of 70.6% and a specificity of 72.7%. CONCLUSIONS: LUS is a rapid and useful triage tool in the work-up of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection during a pandemic scenario.

This disparity may be attributed to the higher seroprevalence of other viral diseases, which can result in the presence of antibodies protective against COVID-19. Two of the widespread diseases in such countries are infection to hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV and HEV). In the present study, we explored the relationship between the level of antibodies against these viruses and the susceptibility to COVID-19. METHODS: Ninety patients were studied in two groups of controls and cases, each consisting 45 individuals. The cases were patients with the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and positive RT-PCR test results. The controls were individuals referred to the respiratory triage of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex and were not demonstrating relevant clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and their RT-PCR test results were negative. Levels of HAV and HEV antibodies were measured and compared in these two groups. RESULTS: The median of HAV antibody level was 13.6 (IQR=11.5-16.9) and 13.2 (IQR =10.7-14.7) in cases and controls, respectively, showing no statistically significant difference (P=0.1). Likewise, the median of HEV antibody level was 6.7 (IQR=5.3-7.1) and 7.1 (IQR=6.3-7.5) in cases and controls, respectively, which again showed no statistically significant difference (P=0.41). CONCLUSION: The present study was carried out in a region with a relatively high prevalence of HAV and HEV infections.

RESULTS: After considering the available literature, areas thought to be most pertinent to clinical and research neuropsychologists, including CNS manifestations, neurologic symptoms/syndromes, neuroimaging, and potential long-term implications of COVID-19 infection, were reviewed. CONCLUSION: Once thought to be merely a respiratory virus, the scientific and medical communities have realized COVID-19 to have broader effects on renal, vascular, and neurological body systems. The question of cognitive deficits is not yet well studied, but neuropsychologists will undoubtedly play an important role in the years to come.","output":"Central Nervous System Manifestations of COVID-19: A Critical Review and Proposed Research Agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic with unprecedented health, societal and economic impact. The disease often manifests with flu-like symptoms and is dominated by pulmonary complications, but widely diverse clinical manifestations involving multiple organ systems can result. We posit that viral tropism and the aberrant host immune response mediate the protean findings and severity in this disease. In general, extrapulmonary manifestations are a harbinger of or contemporaneously associate with disease progression, but in the case of some extrapulmonary findings (GI and dermatologic), may track with milder disease. The precise underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated, and additional immune phenotyping studies are warranted to reveal early correlates of disease outcomes and novel therapeutic targets.

The present study finds that risk-factors for severe COVID-19 disease courses, i.e. male sex, older age and sedentary life style are associated with higher prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) serum levels in blood samples from unaffected subjects. In COVID-19 patients, PGE2 blood levels are markedly elevated and correlate positively with disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 induces PGE2 generation and secretion in infected lung epithelial cells by upregulating cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 and reducing the PG-degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase. Also living human precision cut lung slices (PCLS) infected with SARS-CoV-2 display upregulated COX-2. Regular exercise in aged individuals lowers PGE2 serum levels, which leads to increased Paired-Box-Protein-Pax-5 (PAX5) expression, a master regulator of B-cell survival, proliferation and differentiation also towards long lived memory B-cells, in human pre-B-cell lines. Moreover, PGE2 levels in serum of COVID-19 patients lowers the expression of PAX5 in human pre-B-cell lines. The PGE2 inhibitor Taxifolin reduces SARS-CoV-2-induced PGE2 production. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2, male sex, old age, and sedentary life style increase PGE2 levels, which may reduce the early anti-viral defense as well as the development of immunity promoting severe disease courses and multiple infections. Regular exercise and Taxifolin treatment may reduce these risks and prevent severe disease courses.","output":"Impaired immune response mediated by prostaglandin E2 promotes severe COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyperferritinemia may develop due to various reasons such as inflammation, infection, or malignancy.

Adult patients at the age of 18 years and older with at least one serum ferritin level measurement at or above 500 ng/mL as requested by the rheumatology department between January 2010 and December 2019 were evaluated retrospectively. Hyperferritinemia was detected in 4.7% of 11,498 serum ferritin tests. The mean age of 242 patients found to have hyperferritinemia was 53.7  17.1 years; of the patients, 63.2% were female, and the mean serum ferritin value was 2820  5080 ng/mL. The most common cause of hyperferritinemia was rheumatological diseases with a ratio of 59.1%, which was followed by infections, iron overload, and solid malignancy. Among the rheumatologic diseases, adult-onset Stills disease (AOSD), rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis were the cause accounting for hyperferritinemia. Ferritin levels were significantly higher in the AOSD group compared to the other rheumatologic disease groups (p < 0.0001). While extreme hyperferritinemia (ferritin  10,000 ng/mL) rate in our cohort was 0.2%, the most common cause was AOSD (15/17).

This study aimed to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated to have emerged in Wuhan, China, around 24 November 2019. Phylogenetic analyses of the first 12,511 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences obtained worldwide, including 290 from 11 different regions of Spain, revealed 62 independent introductions of the virus in the country. Most sequences from Spain were distributed in clades characterized by a D614G substitution in the S gene (20A, 20B, and 20C) and an L84S substitution in ORF8 (19B) with 163 and 118 sequences, respectively, with the remaining sequences branching in 19A. A total of 110 (38%) sequences from Spain grouped in four different monophyletic clusters of clade 20A (20A-Sp1 and 20A-Sp2) and 19B clade (19B-Sp1 and 19B-Sp2) along with sequences from 29 countries worldwide. The MRCAs of clusters 19A-Sp1, 20A-Sp1, 19A-Sp2, and 20A-Sp2 were estimated to have occurred in Spain around 21 and 29 January and 6 and 17 February 2020, respectively. The prevalence of clade 19B in Spain (40%) was by far higher than in any other European country during the first weeks of the epidemic, probably as a result of a founder effect. However, this variant was replaced by G614-bearing viruses in April. In vitro assays showed an enhanced infectivity of pseudotyped virions displaying the G614 substitution compared with those having D614, suggesting a fitness advantage of D614G. IMPORTANCE Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain, and at least four resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters that originated not later than mid-February, with further dissemination to many other countries around the world, and a few weeks before the explosion of COVID-19 cases detected in Spain during the first week of March. The majority of the earliest variants detected in Spain branched in the clade 19B (D614 viruses), which was the most prevalent clade during the first weeks of March, pointing to a founder effect. However, from mid-March to June 2020, G614-bearing viruses (clades 20A, 20B, and 20C) overcame D614 variants in Spain, probably as a consequence of an evolutionary advantage of this substitution in the spike protein. A higher infectivity of G614-bearing viruses than D614 variants was detected, suggesting that this substitution in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be behind the variant shift observed in Spain.","output":"A Founder Effect Led Early SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testing people without symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 followed by isolation of those who test positive could mitigate the covid-19 epidemic pending arrival of an effective vaccine.

A cost-effectiveness model that provides answers depending on user-adjustable parameter values is described. Key parameters are the value ascribed to preventing a death and the reproduction number (roughly, rate of spread) at the time surveillance testing is initiated.

Transit bipartition with sleeve gastrectomy is derived from biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and might improve weight loss control. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two series of 71 primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and transit bipartition (TB) with a body mass index  50 kg/m2 were retrospectively compared after 2 years. Postoperative course, side effects, nutritional status, and weight outcomes were reviewed. Weight was expressed as BMI, percentage of excess BMI lost (%EBMIL), and percentage of total weight lost (%TWL). RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable for age and BMI of 51.9  1.8 for RYGB and 51.6  5 for TB. TB was longer to perform (92 vs 74 min, p  0.001) with a 30-day complication rate of 4.2% and 5.6%, but there was 1 death after RYGB. Weight loss was greater after TB compared with RYGB with %EBMIL of 85.3  15.8% vs 73.9  17.2% (p = 0.0002). One TB patient suffered from protein malnutrition but none after RYGB. After TB, 7% of the patients experienced > 3 stools a day and 1 patient required revision, while 3 patients had diarrhea after RYGB. Late reoperations were required for 7 and 1 patients after RYGB and TB. Comorbidity improvement was similar. CONCLUSION In a superobese population, TB appeared relatively safer compared with RYGB.

Methods: A multidisciplinary team of frontline clinicians and data scientists worked to create the Northwell COVIDARDS dataset (NorthCARDS) leveraging over 11,542 COVID-19 hospital admissions. The data was then summarized to examine descriptive differences based on clinically meaningful categories of lung compliance, and to examine trends in oxygenation. Findings: Of the 1595 COVIDARDS patients in the NorthCARDS dataset, there were 538 (346%) who had very low lung compliance (<20ml/cmH 2 O), 982 (632%) with low-normal compliance (20-50ml/cmH 2 O), and 34 (22%) with high lung compliance (>50ml/cmH 2 O).

This study aimed to assess the effects of reducing inflammatory mediators using hemoperfusion (HP) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on the mortality of patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Twelve patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. All patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients were divided into three groups, namely, HP, CRRT and HP+CRRT. The primary outcome was mortality and the secondary outcomes were oxygenation and reduction in inflammatory mediators at the end of the study. Results: Patients were not different at baseline in demographics, inflammatory cytokine levels, and the level of acute phase reactants. Half of the patients (3 out of 6) in the HP+CRRT group survived along with the survival of one patient (1 out of 2) in the HP group. All four patients in the CRRT group died. Serum creatinine (SCr), Interleukin-1 (IL1), Interleukin-6 (IL6), Interleukin-8 (IL8), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), O2 saturation (O2 sat), and hemodynamic parameters improved over time in HP+CRRT and CRRT groups, but no significant difference was observed in the HP group (All Ps >0.05).

The purpose of this study was to clarify the levels and changes of oxygen concentration over time while oxygen was administered over a surgical mask. METHODS: Patients scheduled to undergo general anesthesia (n = 99) were enrolled in this study. First, patients were administered oxygen at 6 L/min via an oxygen mask over a surgical mask for 5 min. The patients removed the surgical mask and then took a 3-min break; thereafter, the same amount of oxygen was administered for another 5 min via the oxygen mask. We measured the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)), the end-tidal CO(2) (EtCO(2)), and respiratory frequency every minute for 5 min, both while administering oxygen with and without a surgical mask. The FiO(2) was measured at the beginning of inspiration and the EtCO(2) was measured at the end of expiration. RESULTS: The FiO(2) at 5 min was significantly lower when breathing with a surgical mask than that without it (mean difference: 0.08 [95% CI: 0.067C0.10]; p < 0.001). In contrast, the EtCO(2) at 5 min was significantly higher when breathing with a surgical mask than that without it (mean difference: 11.9 mmHg [95% CI: 10.9C12.9]; p < 0.001).

The glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I is known to block homeostatic apoptosis through &#945;2,6-linked sialylation of the death receptor TNFR1 in many cell types. However, its role has not been investigated in gastric epithelial cells or gastric tumorigenesis. We determined that human gastric antral epithelium rarely expressed ST6Gal-I, but the number of ST6Gal-I-expressing epithelial cells increased significantly with advancing premalignancy leading to cancer. The mRNA expression level of ST6GAL-I and SOX9 in human gastric epithelial cells correlated positively with one another through the premalignancy cascade, indicating that increased epithelial cell expression of ST6Gal-I is associated with premalignant progression. To determine the functional impact of increased ST6Gal-I, we generated human gastric antral organoids from epithelial stem cells and differentiated epithelial monolayers from gastric organoids. Gastric epithelial stem cells strongly expressed ST6Gal-I, suggesting a novel biomarker of stemness. In contrast, organoid-derived epithelial monolayers expressed markedly reduced ST6Gal-I and underwent TNF-induced, caspase-mediated apoptosis, consistent with homeostasis. Conversely, epithelial monolayers generated from gastric cancer stem cells retained high levels of ST6Gal-I and resisted TNF-induced apoptosis, supporting prolonged survival. Protection from TNF-induced apoptosis was dependent on ST6Gal-I overexpression, since forced ST6Gal-I overexpression in normal gastric stem cell-differentiated monolayers inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis, and cleavage of &#945;2,6-linked sialic acids from gastric cancer organoid-derived monolayers restored susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis. These findings implicate upregulated ST6Gal-I expression in blocking homeostatic epithelial cell apoptosis in gastric cancer pathogenesis, suggesting a mechanism for prolonged epithelioid tumor cell survival.","output":"Modulation of glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I in gastric cancer-derived organoids disrupts homeostatic epithelial cell turnover"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The study aims to explore the mental health of the hotline callers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: Callers (N = 10,490) from the Beijing Psychological Support Hotline from January 21st to June 30th in 2019 and 2020 were enrolled and divided into two groups (during (2020) and before (2019) COVID-19 pandemic). The severity of depressive symptoms, psychological distress, hopefulness, and suicidal ideation (SI) was assessed. Demographic characteristics and major concerns were also collected. Mann-Whitney U and chi-square test were used to compare the differences in mental health conditions and major concerns between two years and between different age groups. The multivariable logistic regression was used to explore whether mental health conditions were associated with pandemic and demographic factors. RESULTS: Results from multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that the change in suicidal ideation (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.21C1.92) was significantly different across age groups. Callers during the pandemic reported a higher level of hopefulness (OR = 1.13, 95% CI [1.03C1.24]), a lower level of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.74C0.89]) and psychological distress (OR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.81C0.98]), and were less likely to report SI (OR = 0.69, 95% CI [0.61C0.77]) compared with callers before the pandemic.

METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional approach using purposive sampling techniques. The online survey was conducted from May through September 2020. A total of 200 respondents from the West Java province in Indonesia were included. Data on mental health, work satisfaction, and quality of life were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearsons correlation coefficient, and multivariate regression analysis. Responses to open questions regarding concerns and strengths were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: An increased mental health symptom experienced by healthcare professionals was associated with decreased health status (=?0.724, p=0.001) and self-perceived health (=?0.59, p=0.001). Further, serving patients with COVID-19 (=?0.133, p=0.024) was related to lower health status. Five themes emerged regarding concerns about being exposed to COVID-19, namely 1) fear of transmitting the virus, 2) the impact of COVID-19 on family life, 3) death and isolation, 4) personal safety, and 5) social stigma. Five themes emerged regarding the source of encouragement and strength, ie. 1) religiosity, 2) social support systems, 3) the moral responsibility of the profession, 4) following health and safety protocols, and 5) acceptance and positive attitudes towards the future.

Patients were classified according to the time elapsed from the onset of symptoms, as follows: early (0-4 days), intermediate/progressive (5-9 days), or advanced (10 days). We analyzed the frequency of each radiologic finding, as well as the pattern, appearance, and predominant distribution of lung involvement. A visual tomographic score (range, 0-25) was used to estimate the extent of involvement in each lobe and in the total lung volume. Results The predominant CT finding was the ground-glass pattern (n = 110; 60.4%), the most common distribution was peripheral (n = 116; 66.7%), and the most prevalent appearance was typical (n = 112; 61.5%). The halo sign was seen most frequently in the early phase (25%), whereas ground-glass opacities were more common in the intermediate/progressive and advanced phases.

ACE acts in a positive feedback loop, providing amplification, while ACE2, acting in a negative feedback loop, modulates the ACE action, providing stability and fine control. Certain demographic groups that are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19-and once infected, to have more severe disease and higher mortality-have a deficiency of ACE2. ACE2 has recently been shown to be a major receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters cells. This entry process is associated with downregulation of ACE2. Thus, viral cell entry per se can interfere with the RAS feedback system. Viral penetration of cells using ACE2 can lead to a shift in the RAS from the usual preventive ACE2 axis to the adverse ACE axis of the feedback systems. This imbalance, with predominance of the adverse ACE axis, can lead to downstream actions of increased vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thrombosis. These, in turn, can affect end organs, initiating COVID-19-associated conditions such as cytokine storm, thrombosis, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This focused review highlights the importance of feedback systems in our understanding of the disruption of ACE2 feedback and resulting clinical consequences in COVID-19.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, feedback systems, and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing) are recommended to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses. However, few epidemiological studies have assessed whether social distancing in actual settings reduces the disease burden of severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) in the general population. Accordingly, we aimed to assess associations between nationwide social distancing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and non-COVID-19 SARIs. We collected data on SARI epidemiologic characteristics recorded from January 2018 through December 2020 from the nationwide sentinel SARI surveillance data maintained by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The number of SARIs per 1000 hospitalized patients decreased significantly to 18.61, 18.15, and 6.25 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (p<0.001), respectively, during the surveillance period of 3 years. The number of intensive care unit admissions associated with SARIs per 1000 hospitalized patients was 0.83, 0.69, and 0.54 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (p<0.001), respectively, and the number of SARI-associated mortalities per 1000 patients was 0.42, 0.29, and 0.27 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (p<0.001), respectively. Moreover, SARIs had two peak seasons in 2 years of the surveillance period (2018 and 2019). However, seasonality was not observed since social distancing was initiated. Our sentinel surveillance data demonstrated a remarkable reduction in SARI disease burden and a change in seasonality following the implementation of nationwide social distancing. Accordingly, we suggest that social distancing could be effective in forthcoming seasonal epidemics of non-COVID19 origin, although the impact thereof on other aspects of society needs to be carefully considered.","output":"Nationwide Social Distancing and the Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Involvement of the posterior cerebral structures is well established in patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).

This study aims to investigate the effects of PPO extracted from Edible mushroom on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro and explore the therapeutic effects of PPO on tumors in vivo. A cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay was used to detect the effect of PPO on the proliferation of cancer cells. The effect of PPO on cancer cell migration ability was detected by scratch test. The effect of PPO on the invasion ability of cancer cells was detected by a transwell assay. The effect of PPO on the apoptosis of cancer cells was detected by flow cytometry. Female BALB/c mice (18C25 g, 6C8 weeks) were used for in vivo experiments. The experiments were divided into control group, model group, low-dose group (25 mg/kg), and high-dose group (50 mg/kg).

However, the underlying mechanism of virulence attenuation associated with PA-X is still unknown. In this study, we compared two PA-X-deficient mutant viruses and the parental virus in terms of induction of pathology and manipulation of host response in the mouse lung, stimulation of cell death and PA nuclear accumulation. We first found that down-regulated PA-X expression markedly aggravated the acute lung injury of the infected mice early on day 1 post-infection (p.i.). We then determined that loss of PA-X expression induced higher levels of cytokines, chemokines and complement-derived peptides (C3a and C5a) in the lung, especially at early time points p.i. In addition, in vitro assays showed that the PA-X-deficient viruses enhanced cell death and increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mammalian cells. Moreover, we also found that PA nuclear accumulation of the PA-X-null viruses accelerated in MDCK cells. These results demonstrate that PA-X decreases the level of complement components, ROS, cell death and inflammatory response, which may together contribute to the alleviated lung injury and the attenuation of the virulence of H5N1 virus in mice.","output":"PA-X-associated early alleviation of the acute lung injury contributes to the attenuation of a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An essential indicator of COVID-19 transmission is the effective reproduction number (Rt), the number of cases which an infected individual is expected to infect at a particular point in time;curves of the evolution of Rt over time (transmission curves) reflect the impact of preventive measures and whether an epidemic is controlled.We have created a Shiny/R web application (https://alfredob.shinyapps.io/estR0/) with user-selectable features: open data sources with daily COVID-19 incidences from all countries and many regions, customizable preprocessing options (smoothing, proportional increment, etc.), different MonteCarlo-Markov-Chain estimates of the generation time or serial interval distributions and state-of-the-art Rt estimation frameworks (EpiEstim, R0).

Despite the fact that the organized community mobilized resources and worked tirelessly to sustain life from the very beginning of the pandemic, the authorities have insisted on blaming the population for the spread of the virus, pointing to an alleged neglect of care. As part of a qualitative case study, intended to characterize community response to the pandemic, twelve semi-structured interviews were held with members of different social organizations in Independencia, along with a number of ethnographic visits. The analysis characterizes the territory, and addresses the social consequences left by the pandemic, the community actions taken in this context, and the communitys assessment of these. The results allow us to sustain that organizational logics have changed in Independencia since the so-called Chilean Estallido Social or Social Outburst which took place in October 2019, and, in this context of socio-political crisis and deficient state response, the health emergency is being dealt with by means of community care actions. We conclude that people respond to the consequences of the pandemic collectively, through actions intended to sustain life, and to constitute a political praxis derived from the revitalization of the community fabric as a result of the social outbreak. The originality and contribution of this article is that it addresses an experience that encourages reflection on the importance of care in sustaining a community.

Several parameters control the functional scaffolds, such as fiber geometrical characteristics and alignment, architecture, etc. As it is based on nanotechnology, the concept of this approach has shown a strong evolution in terms of the forms of the materials used (aerogels, microspheres, etc.), the incorporated microorganisms used to treat diseases (cells, proteins, nuclei acids, etc.), and the manufacturing process in relation to the control of adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of the mimetic nanofibers.

However, until now, we know little about the mechanism of osseointegration on zirconia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Syndecan (Sdc) on osteoblastic cell (MC3T3-E1) adhesion and proliferation onto zirconia materials. Materials and Methods: The mirror-polished disks 15 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thick of commercial pure titanium (CpTi), 3mol% yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (3Y-TZP) and nano-zirconia (NanoZr) are used in this study. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded onto specimen surfaces and subjected to RNA interference (RNAi) for Syndecan-1, Syndecan-2, Syndecan-3, and Syndecan-4. At 48h post-transfection, the cell morphology, actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesion were observed using scanning electron microscopy or laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. At 24h and 48h post-transfection, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to investigate cell proliferation. Results: The cell morphology of MC3T3-E1 cells on CpTi, 3Y-TZP, and NanoZr changed into abnormal shape after gene silencing of Syndecan. Among the Syndecan family, Sdc-2 is responsible for NanoZr-specific morphology regulation, via maintenance of cytoskeletal conformation without affecting cellular attachment. According to CCK-8 assay, Sdc-2 affects the osteoblastic cell proliferation onto NanoZr. Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, we suggest that Syndecan affects osteoblastic cell adhesion on CpTi, 3Y-TZP, and NanoZr. Sdc-2 might be an important heparin-sensitive cell membrane regulator in osteoblastic cell adhesion, specifically on NanoZr, through the organization of actin cytoskeleton and affects osteoblastic cell proliferation.","output":"The Effects of Syndecan on Osteoblastic Cell Adhesion Onto Nano-Zirconia Surface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID pandemic has been a major disruptor of preventive health programs. We set out to establish the burden and control rates of hypertension(HTN) at the dawn of this pandemic, providing baseline reference measures for which the impact of the pandemic on HTN prevalence and control rates can be assessed in future. Methods HTN was classified as mean systolic blood pressure (mSBP) 130 mmHg or mean diastolic blood pressure (mDBP) 80 mmHg or self-reported current use of antihypertensive medications. Hypertensives on medications with mSBP <130 mmHg and mDBP <80 mmHg were considered as well-controlled. Chi-square test was used in subgroup comparisons of HTN prevalence and p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results The age-adjusted pre-pandemic prevalence of HTN in the US was 52.3% (50.2-54.3). The prevalence was significantly higher in men: 54.7% (51.6-57.8), Non Hispanic Blacks: 64.8%(62.8-66.9), obese: 62.8%(60.8-64.8) and persons aged  60years: 77.1%(74.3-79.8). The control rate of HTN was 44.2% (42.0-46.5). There was a statistically significant difference in the rate of control across socioeconomic and racial groups. Conclusion About 52% of individuals 20 years in the USA were hypertensives and less than half of them on medications were well-controlled.

To ensure continued response to the epidemic is most effective, it is imperative to better understand both retrospectively and prospectively the geographical evolution of COVID-19 caseloads and deaths, identify localised areas in space-time at significantly higher risk, quantify the impact of changes in localised population mobility (or movement) on caseloads, identify localised risk factors for increased mortality and project the likely course of the epidemic at small-area resolution in coming weeks. Methods: : We applied a Bayesian spaceCtime SEIR model to assess the spatiotemporal variability of COVID-19 caseloads (transmission) and deaths at small-area scale in England (Middle Layer Super Output Area [MSOA], 6791 units) and by week (using observed data from week 5 to 34), including key determinants, the modelled transmission dynamics and spatial-temporal random effects. We also estimate the number of cases and deaths at small-area resolution with uncertainty projected forward in time by MSOA (up to week 51 of 2020), the impact mobility reductions (and subsequent easing) have had on COVID-19 caseloads and quantify the impact of key socio-demographic risk factors on COVID-19 related mortality risk by MSOA. Results: : Reductions in population mobility due the course of the first lockdown had a significant impact on the reduction of COVID-19 caseloads across England, however local authorities have had a varied rate of reduction in population movement which our model suggest has substantially impacted the geographic heterogeneity in caseloads at small-area scale. The steady gain in population mobility, observed from late April, appears to have contributed to a slowdown in caseload reductions towards late June and subsequent steady increase signalling the start of the second wave. MSOA with higher proportions of elderly (70+ years of age) and elderly living in deprivation, both with very distinct geographic distributions, have a significantly elevated COVID-19 mortality rates. Conclusions: : While non-pharmaceutical interventions (that is, reductions in population mobility and social distancing) had a profound impact on the trajectory of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in England, increased population mobility appears to have contributed to the current increase signalling the start of the second wave. A number of contiguous small-areas appear to be at a significant elevated risk of high COVID-19 transmission, many of which are also at increased risk for higher mortality rates. A geographically staggered re-introduction of intensified social distancing measures is advised and limited cross MSOA movement if the magnitude and geographic extent of the second wave is to be reduced.","output":"Bayesian small-area modelling of COVID-19 cases and deaths in England and association with key risk factors: a combined spaceCtime Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Viruses are a group of viruses that can cause diseases such as colds, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) A new type of corona virus has been discovered after it was identified as the cause of the spread of one of the diseases that started in China in 2019 This disease is considered one of the most dangerous things in the world, which directly affected many areas and led to high financial losses The risk in this disease lies in its wide spread and the difficulty in dealing with and responding to it So remote control technologies is the best solution for monitoring the patient's condition and monitoring the change of symptoms The internet of thing one of modern technology which aims to shares files, software, programs and other tools to allow user to uses the devises with each other to apply the communication between them it includes many devices communication between them by intelligent decisions building modern IOT system based smart devices and sensors is the best solution to detect the patient of COVID-19 at real time The study shows how effective device to detect of COVID-19 patient in IOT system ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Certain Investigations on IoT system for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and update the evidence on the comparative efficacy and safety of antimicrobial drugs regimens for treating pulmonary drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB). METHODS: A systematic review was performed with searches in PubMed and Scopus (PROSPERO-CRD42019141463). We included randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of any antimicrobial regimen lasting at least 2 weeks. The outcomes of interest were culture conversion and incidence of adverse events. Bayesian network meta-analyses and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) analyses were performed. Results were reported as odds ratio with 95% credibility intervals. KEY FINDINGS: Fifteen studies were included the meta-analysis (n = 7560 patients). No regimen was statistically more effective than the WHO standard approach (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide). The use of rifapentine 450 mg instead of rifampicin in the standard regimen demonstrated to be statistically safer than all other options for serious adverse events (e.g. hepatotoxicity, arthralgia) (OR ranging from 0.0 [Crl 0.00-0.04] to 0.0 [0.00-0.97]; SUCRA probabilities of 10%). Therapies containing rifapentine (Rp1500HEZ, Rp900HEZ) and moxifloxacin (RMEZ, RHMZ) are effective regarding culture conversion, but statistical uncertainty on their safety profile exists. CONCLUSION: The WHO standard regimen remains an overall effective and safe alternative for DS-TB. For intensive phase treatments, drugs combinations with rifapentine and moxifloxacin seem to reduce treatment duration while maintaining efficacy.","output":"Efficacy and safety of daily treatments for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the biological impacts and possible mechanisms of a novel lncRNA, LncSIK1, in AML progression and retinoic acid-regulated AML cell development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression pattern of LncSIK1 was evaluated by qPCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. CCK-8 assay, immunofluorescence, Wright-Giemsa staining, flow cytometry and Western blotting were performed to assess cell proliferation and differentiation. Bioluminescence imaging and H&E staining were used to detect AML progression in vivo. RNA or chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to measure the interaction of E2F1 and LncSIK1 or the LC3 and DRAM promoters. Autophagy was measured by transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting. RESULTS: LncSIK1 was silenced in bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients compared with those from healthy donors. LncSIK1 strengthened the effect of retinoic acid in inducing cell differentiation and inhibiting cell proliferation in AML cells. Moreover, the silencing of LncSIK1 was critical to maintaining AML leukaemogenesis, as LncSIK1 enhancement retarded AML progression in vivo. Mechanistically, in NB4 cells, LncSIK1 recruited the E2F1 protein to the promoters of LC3 and DRAM and induced autophagy-dependent degradation of the oncoprotein PML-RARa. However, LncSIK1 blocked E2F1 expression and the E2F1-mediated transcription of LC3 and DRAM, thereby relieving aggressive autophagy in Molm13 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicated that LncSIK1 was an important regulator of AML development through regulating the E2F1/autophagy signalling pathway.","output":"LncSIK1 enhanced the sensitivity of AML cells to retinoic acid by the E2F1/autophagy pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about an unprecedented time.

This study analyzed the incidence, mechanism, and outcomes of intraoperative perforations during these procedures in a large institutional experience. METHODS All patients who underwent lap foregut surgery including laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS), paraesophageal hernia (PEH) repair, Heller myotomy, and reoperative hiatal hernia (redo HH) repair at the authors' institution from August 2004 to September 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Perforation events and postoperative outcomes were analyzed, and complications were graded by the modified Clavien system. All data are expressed as means  standard deviations or as medians. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS In this study, the repairs for 1,223 patients were analyzed (381 LARS procedures, 379 PEH repairs, 313 Heller myotomies, 150 redo HH repairs). Overall, 51 patients (4.2 %) had 56 perforations resulting from LARS (n = 4, 1 %), PEH repair (n = 7, 1.8 %), Heller myotomy (n = 18, 5.8 %), and redo HH repair (n = 22, 14.6 %). Redo HH was significantly more likely to result in perforations than LARS or PEH repair (p < 0.001). The locations of the perforations were esophageal in 13 patients (23.6 %), gastric in 40 patients (72.7 %), and indeterminate in 2 patients (3.6 %). The most common mechanisms of perforations were suture placement for LARS (75 %) and traction for PEH repair (43 %) and for Heller myotomy during the myotomy (72 %). The most redo HH perforations resulted from dissection/wrap takedown (73 %) and traction (14 %). Perforations were recognized and repaired intraoperatively in 43 cases (84 %) and postoperatively in eight cases (16 %). Perforations discovered postoperatively were more likely to require reoperation (75 vs 2 %; p < 0.001), to require more gastrointestinal and radiologic interventions (50 vs 2 %; p = 0.004), and to have higher morbidity (88 vs 26 %; p = 0.004) than perforations recognized intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS In a high-volume center, intraoperative perforations are the most frequent with reoperative HH repair. If perforations are recognized and repaired intraoperatively, they require minimal postoperative intervention. Unrecognized perforations usually require reoperation and result in significantly greater morbidity.","output":"Incidence, mechanisms, and outcomes of esophageal and gastric perforation during laparoscopic foregut surgery: a retrospective review of 1,223 foregut cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 detection has been described in several animal species.

Considering that COVID\\\\19 suddenly became a pandemic and healthcare professionals have not had access to sufficient information, it is a fact that healthcare professionals have been affected on a large scale. Heavy workloads, insufficient equipment and anxiety over families increase this impact. We aimed to investigate the extent to which healthcare professionals have been psychologically affected by COVID\\\\19 and related factors. METHODOLOGY: Data obtained through questionnaires completed by 348 healthcare professionals working during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and 350 participants who are in the control group were investigated. The Impact of Event Scale\\\\revised (IES\\\\R) for post\\\\traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the Severity Index (ISI) for insomnia were used. Differences regarding gender, occupation, age group, marital status and sub\\\\groups were statistically analysed. RESULTS: Of the 348 healthcare professionals, 176 (50.6%) were women and 172 (49.4%) men, while 190 (54.6%) were doctors and 158 (45.4%) nurses. The incidence of PTSD was statistically significantly higher in the healthcare professionals group than in the control group (P < .001). The incidence of PTSD was statistically significantly higher amongst nurses (P = .001), women (P = .002) and those who were married (P = .007). Both PTSD and insomnia were found to be statistically significantly higher amongst those working in the area of final diagnosis (P = .016 and P = .002, respectively).

This article compares the nine features of digital citizen provided by Ribble and Bailey (2007) with a case study conducted in a multicultural setting and identifies the tensions between ethics, religion and cultural norms in that environment. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach has been used in this research. Why case study? Because it is unique and provides in-depth, unique and invaluable findings. Case studies researchers have contributed to the development of case study research from diverse disciplines. Historical examples of case studies go back as far as the nineteenth century with the biography of Charles Darwin (Stewart, 2014). The dominance of positivism in science in the late 1940 and 1950s in social science sidelined qualitative approaches such as case studies. Although case study research was often criticized for its inability to support generalizations, and thus, provided limited validity and value as a research design (Merriam, 2009;Stewart, 2014), case study research provides intensive analysis of an issue. A Case study is intrinsic, instrumental and collective (Stake, 1995, 2006). Case study research encourages the detailed enquiry of a unit of analysis within its context. Findings: Findings show that current society needs to be educated on the nine aspects of digital citizenship. In the current era, changes are so rapid that every now and then, there must be collaboration and cooperation between different agencies to ensure that the tension between religiosity, cultural norms and ethics would be able to find some common ground. With more knowledge and wisdom on human rights, sustainability education and project-based learning in Civics Education, teachers, students, parents and community should often meet to decide on controversial issues and find ways to ensure that each one in society has the knowledge, skills and values for digital citizenship to grow and flourish.

As a virus with an RNA genome that codes for its own genomic replication proteins, mutations in these proteins can significantly impact the variance rate of the genome, affecting both the survival and infection rate of the virus, and attempts at combating the disease. In this study, we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the RNA synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates. Our observations suggest mutations in nsp14, an error-correcting exonuclease protein, have the strongest association with increased mutation load in both regions without selective pressure and across the genome, compared to nsp7, 8, and 12, which form the core polymerase complex.

This led to delays in the initiation and completion of cancer treatment. We assessed the long-term health consequences because of the delay in diagnosis and treatment for cervical cancer due to COVID-19 in India. METHODS: We used a Markov-model-based analysis assessing the lifetime health outcomes of the cohort of women population at risk from cervical cancer in India. The decrease in survival for those with the treatment interruption was calculated based on the number of days the treatment was extended beyond the standard duration. Furthermore, to model the impact of late diagnosis and delayed treatment initiation, the patients were assumed to have upstaged during the delay period, as per natural progression of disease. RESULTS: We estimate 2.52% (n = 795) to 3.80% (n = 2,160) lifetime increase in the deaths caused by cervical cancer with treatment restrictions ranging from 9 weeks to 6 months, respectively, as compared to no delay. On the contrary, 88-238 deaths because of COVID-19 disease are estimated to be saved during this restriction period among the patients with cervical cancer. Overall, the excess mortality because of cervical cancer led to 18,159-53,626 life-years being lost and an increase of 16,808-50,035 disability-adjusted life-years. CONCLUSION: Delays in diagnosis and treatment are likely to lead to more cervical cancer deaths as compared to COVID-19 mortality averted among the patients with cervical cancer.

Although there have been some studies already published, results have been heterogeneous and conflicting;possibly because of different populations or geographical locations examined. In this preliminary study we aim to identify the impact of the pandemic on the severity of OCD, as measured by Y-BOCS scores. To our knowledge, it is the first UK study of this kind and the only study that examines change in Y-BOCS scores over such a long time period. Method Patients were identified from national OCD unit referral databases at Springfield Hospital. Referrals from March 2019CMarch 2020 were examined and patients included if they had a diagnosis of OCD, were accepted by the service following initial assessment and sufficient data were available. This preliminary study focused only on Y-BOCS to assess clinician-rated severity of OCD. Y-BOCS scores were compared from different time periods correlating to the progression of COVID-19. Pre-pandemic score was taken from JanCDec 2019 or, if not available, from JanC23 March 2020 (prior to UK lockdown). Pandemic score was taken as the most recent rating from April 2020 onwards. Result 21 patients were included. All treated as outpatients (although 9 had undergone previous inpatient treatment during the time period above). 81% showed improvement in Y-BOCS score between pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods, with an overall mean decrease in Y-BOCS of 10.3. Conclusion Overall, this study indicates that severity of OCD decreased during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. It may be that patients found it easier to access remote appointments, or perhaps the pandemic environment of being encouraged to stay at home and limiting unnecessary contact may have allowed limited opportunity for exposure. It might be that the pandemic provided a reason for patients to be avoidant of potential contamination thereby leading to a perceived rather than real improvement in Y-BOCS scores. Identification of specific contributing factors is beyond the scope of this preliminary study, however it will be important to conduct further research with a larger sample size that incorporates post-lockdown and post-pandemic scores to ascertain whether trends seen here are in fact maintained when normal social contact resumes.","output":"A preliminary study into the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is a kind of life threat disease encountered at high altitude, but the precise pathogenesis of it is far more understood. Hypobaic hypoxia (HH) and cold are conditions characteristic of high altitude environment. HH is always considered as the central causative factor for the development of HACE, but the effect of cold stress on HACE has been rarely investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of cold stress in the development of HACE and establish a stable experimental animal model. Male SPF Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups for this experiment, control group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 25 ), NC + 2  group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 2 ), HH group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 25 ), HH+2  group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 2 ) and HH + 12/2  (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 12 /2  light/dark cycle). After exposure for 72 h, the blood and brain tissues were collected. Brain water content (BWC) and Evans Blue dye extravasation were used to assess the brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Oxidative stress markers and ATPase activity were determined using commercial kits. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of related proteins. Compared to control, HH+2  could significantly increase the BWC and BBB permeability, and these changes were further exacerbated by HH + 12/2 . Furthermore, HH+2  and HH + 12/2  markedly increased the levels of H2O2 and MDA, restrained SOD and GSH levels and decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activitie compared with the control group. In addition, HH+2  and HH + 12/2  enhanced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, TNF- and IL-6 in serum and significantly increased the expression of VEGF in brain compared with the control group, but only HH + 12/2  could increase the expression of AQP4. However, compared with control group, no significant differences in these parameters were observed in HH and NC+2 groups.

GDM, the most common metabolic disorder in pregnancy, can be considered the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. A critical point in this view is the identification of genes which are epigenetically modified under the influence of GDM. The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene plays a crucial role in nutritional health by suppressing appetite and participating in energy control regulation. The correlations between pregnant 'women's metabolic profiles and placental epigenetic modifications of this gene have been poorly investigated. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of GDM and maternal clinical parameters at the third trimester of pregnancy to DNA methylation levels in the placenta at CpG sites of MC4R gene. Design and Methods: Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, Mediterranean diet adherence, smoking habits, and physical activity were assessed at the third trimester of pregnancy of 60 Caucasian pregnant women, of which 33 with GDM. Clinical parameters of the newborns were recorded at birth. MC4R DNA methylation on maternal and fetal sides of the placenta was analyzed using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Results: MC4R DNA methylation levels at CpG1 and CpG2 were lower on the fetal side of the placenta in GDM-affected women than in non-GDM-affected recruits (p = 0.033). Moreover, DNA methylation levels on the maternal side at CpG1 were positively related to glucose concentration at 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). On the other hand, CpG2 DNA methylation was positively related to both 1-h and 2-h during OGTT. Maternal DNA methylation level at CpG2 was also associated with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at the third trimester of pregnancy (rho = 0.340, p < 0.05), while CpG1 methylation was negatively related to maternal weight variations at delivery (rho = -0.316, p < 0.05). Significant associations between MC4R DNA methylation on the maternal side and lipid profile at third trimester of pregnancy in women smokers were found. Conclusion: Our results suggest that MC4R methylation profile in the placenta is related to maternal metabolic and nutritional conditions, potentially affecting fetal programming and the future metabolic health of the newborn.","output":"The Obesogenic Environment: Epigenetic Modifications in Placental Melanocortin 4 Receptor Gene Connected to Gestational Diabetes and Smoking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viridans streptococci (VGS) form a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of species belonging to the genus Streptococcus (1).

Phase 1A included health care personnel with direct patient contact, and residents and staff of nursing homes (NHs) and assisted living facilities (ALFs). Following this initial phase, individuals 65 years of age and older became eligible for vaccination, along with individuals determined by hospital providers to be extremely medically vulnerable to COVID-19. This strategy was based on the desire to most immediately reduce morbidity and mortality, as COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is age-related. Through March 15, 2021, 4,338,099 individuals received COVID-19 vaccine, including 2,431,540 individuals who completed their vaccination series. Of all those vaccinated, 70% were 65 years of age and older, and 63% of those 65 years of age and older. Beginning February 1, 2021, the decline in the number of new cases per week became greater in those 65 years of age and older than those younger.

CREST2 is comparing intensive medical management alone versus intensive medical management plus revascularization with endarterectomy or stenting. We performed a study to evaluate the feasibility of a home-based program for testing blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in CREST2. METHODS: This study involved 45 patients at 10 sites in the CREST2 trial. The initial patients were identified by the Medical Management Core (MMC) as high-risk patients defined by stage 2 hypertension, LDL > 90 mg/dl, or both. If a patient at the site declined participation, another was substituted. All patients who agreed to participate were sent a BP monitoring device and a commercially available at-home lipid test kit that uses a self-performed finger-stick blood sample that was resulted to the patient. Training on the use of the equipment and obtaining the risk factor results was done by the study coordinator by telephone. RESULTS: Ten of the 130 currently active CREST2 sites participated, 8 in the LDL portion and 5 in the BP portion (3 sites did both). Twenty-six BP devices and 23 lipid tests were sent to patients. Of the 26 patients who obtained BP readings with the devices, 9 were out of the study target and adjustments in BP medications were made in 3. Of the 23 patients sent LDL tests, 13 were able to perform the test showing 7 were out of target, leading to adjustments in lipid medications in 4.

Deciphering which neonates are at increased risk for mortality can have an important global impact. As such, integrating high computational technology (e.g., artificial intelligence [AI]) may help identify the early and potentially modifiable predictors of neonatal mortality. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collate, critically appraise, and analyze neonatal prediction studies that included AI. METHODS A literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, OVID, and Google Scholar. We included studies that used AI (e.g., machine learning (ML) and deep learning) to formulate prediction models for neonatal death. We excluded small studies (n < 500 individuals) and studies using only antenatal factors to predict mortality. Two independent investigators screened all articles for inclusion. The data collection consisted of study design, number of models, features used per model, feature importance, internal and/or external validation, and calibration analysis. Our primary outcome was the average area under the receiving characteristic curve (AUC) or sensitivity and specificity for all models included in each study. RESULTS Of 434 articles, 11 studies were included. The total number of participants was 1.26 M with gestational ages ranging from 22 weeks to term. Number of features ranged from 3 to 66 with timing of prediction as early as 5 min of life to a maximum of 7 days of age. The average number of models per study was 4, with neural network, random forest, and logistic regression comprising the most used models (58.3%). Five studies (45.5%) reported calibration plots and 2 (18.2%) conducted external validation. Eight studies reported results by AUC and 5 studies reported the sensitivity and specificity. The AUC varied from 58.3% to 97.0%. The mean sensitivities ranged from 63% to 80% and specificities from 78% to 99%. The best overall model was linear discriminant analysis, but it also had a high number of features (n = 17). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION ML models can accurately predict death in neonates. This analysis demonstrates the most commonly used predictors and metrics for AI prediction models for neonatal mortality. Future studies should focus on external validation, calibration, as well as deployment of applications that can be readily accessible to health-care providers.","output":"Machine Learning Models for Predicting Neonatal Mortality: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is scarcity of data about the long-term results such as port-site hernia, body image scale and cosmesis scale outcomes between laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery and conventional multiport laparoscopy (CMPL) for hysterectomy. Eighty women, who underwent total hysterectomy by the LESS (n = 40) and CMPL (n = 40) technique due to benign and malign gynecological disorders, were evaluated with a cosmesis and body image questionnaire in an age-matched cohort study. Median follow-up time was 25 (6-30) months in both groups. The mean age of the patients was 49.3  6.3 years. The mean body image scale scores were 5.3  0.6 and 5.5  1.2 in the LESS and CMPL groups, respectively (p = 0.268). The mean cosmesis and scar scale scores were significantly higher in the LESS group compared to the CMPL group (p = .011 and p < .001, respectively). Port-site hernia was detected in two patients in the LESS group, but not in the CMPL group. There was no cuff dehiscence in the LESS nor in the CMPL group. The LESS technique provides better cosmesis when compared with the CMPL technique. The body image perceptions in the two groups were similar. Women who wish to undergo the LESS surgery should be informed about the risk of incisional hernia. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Short-term results of LESS hysterectomy such as complication rates, additional port requirement, conversion to CMPL or laparotomy, pain score and analgesic use were evaluated in various studies. Several studies have been published on the safety and efficacy of single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH); however, it has been unclear whether single-port LH offers benefits over multiport LH regarding long-term patient satisfaction and cosmetic satisfaction. What do the results of this study add? In this prospective cohort study, we aimed to compare long-term results (at least six months) of abdominal incisional scar between LESS and CMPL surgery for hysterectomy. The LESS technique provides better cosmesis when compared with the CMPL technique, although, the body image perceptions in the two groups were similar. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? LESS technique can be offered as an option for hysterectomy since it provides better long-term cosmesis compared to CMPL.","output":"Comparison of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery and conventional multiport laparoscopic (CMPL) surgery for hysterectomy: long-term outcomes of abdominal incisional scar."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Maternal anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibodies can cross the placenta during pregnancy, and neonates born to infected mothers have acquired antibodies at birth. Few studies reported data on the histopathological changes of the placenta during infection and placental infection.

The prospective study aims to evaluate the risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and placental passage of anti-Spike antibodies as well as the impact of clinical severity on placental structures. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study on 30 pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2 with their neonates. The demographic features and pregnancy outcomes were collected. Gross and microscopic examinations of the placentas were done. Maternal and umbilical cord sera were obtained at the time of delivery. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from neonates immediately after birth. RESULTS: The concentrations of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibodies were higher in pregnant women with moderate to severe/critical disease. The maternal total anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike levels were correlated with those of neonatal levels. The rate of placental abnormalities is high in the mothers with severe disease, and those with positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM. All neonates had negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS- CoV-2 infections and all placentas were negative in immunohistochemical staining for Spike protein. DISCUSSION: The maternally derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody can transmit to neonates born to infected mothers regardless of gestational age.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with a favorable vaccine response to tozinameran. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study was conducted in a specialized multiple sclerosis clinic at a university hospital from January 21 to December 1, 2021. Of 75 patients evaluated for participation who received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with planned or ongoing treatment with rituximab, 69 were included in the study, and data from 67 were analyzed. EXPOSURES: Sex, age, number of previous rituximab infusions, accumulated dose of rituximab, previous COVID-19 infection, time since last rituximab treatment, CD19(+) B-cell count before vaccination, CD4(+) T-cell count, and CD8(+) T-cell count were considered potential factors associated with the main outcome. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Serological vaccine responses were measured by quantitation of anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, antiCreceptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies, and their neutralizing capacities. Cellular responses to spike proteinCderived SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools were assessed by counting interferon gamma spot-forming units in a FluoroSpot assay. RESULTS: Among 60 patients with ongoing rituximab treatment (49 women [82%]; mean (SD) age, 43 [10] years), the median (range) disease duration was 9 (1-29) years, and the median (range) dose of rituximab was 2750 (500-10 000) mg during a median (range) time of 2.8 (0.5-8.3) years. The median (range) follow-up from the first vaccination dose was 7.3 (4.3-10.0) months. Vaccine responses were determined before vaccination with tozinameran and 6 weeks after vaccination. By using established cutoff values for anti-spike IgG (264 binding antibody units/mL) and anti-RBD IgG (506 binding antibody units/mL), the proportion of patients with a positive response increased with the number of B cells, which was the only factor associated with these outcomes. A cutoff for the B-cell count of at least 40/L was associated with an optimal serological response. At this cutoff, 26 of 29 patients (90%) had positive test results for anti-spike IgG and 21 of 29 patients (72%) for anti-RBD IgG, and 27 of 29 patients (93%) developed antibodies with greater than 90% inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. No factor associated with the cellular response was identified. Depending on the peptide pool, 21 of 25 patients (84%) to 22 of 25 patients (88%) developed a T-cell response with interferon gamma production at the B-cell count cutoff of at least 40/L. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that for an optimal vaccine response from tozinameran, rituximab-treated patients with multiple sclerosis may be vaccinated as soon as possible, with rituximab treatment delayed until B-cell counts have reached at least 40/L. An additional vaccination with tozinameran should be considered at that point.","output":"Factors Associated With Serological Response to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Rituximab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 have become increasingly common in published literature as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate the world.

The focus is on poor women as this group was considered most vulnerable, notably because of the dependency on the salaries of poor women. The article enlists how this pandemic is different from others in the sense that there is a differentiated impact on poor women. The differentiated impact is discussed under various themes, including ability to social distance, transportation implications, access to food and access to the COVID-19 relief grant. Access to COVID-19 grants and subsequent relief measures are assessed for their accessibility to poor women. The discussion engages the latest statistics available in 2020 during the pandemic and also reflects on what this means for the future. The article broadly explores the poverty gap and how this impacts poor women and looks at inequality in terms of labour demands on poor women during the pandemic.

PMT postulates both the threat appraisal and the coping appraisal as predictors of health behaviors. Recent advances in the field of behavioral immune system (BIS) research suggest that humans are equipped with a set of psychological adaptations enabling them to detect the disease-threat and activate behavioral avoidance of pathogens. The present study, set within PMT framework and informed by the BIS research, aimed to explain and predict voluntary adherence to COVID-19 guidelines by perceived personal risk and vulnerability to disease as threat appraisal variables, and trust in science as the response efficacy element of coping appraisal.

On the other hand, only the belief in the second wave and trust in science were significant positive predictors of the intent to adhere to pharmacological COVID-19 recommendations (i.e., to vaccinate). Interventions aimed at enhancing preventative measures adherence should take into account that the psychological mechanisms underlying adherence to these two types of recommendations are not identical.","output":"Trust in Science, Perceived Vulnerability to Disease, and Adherence to Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological COVID-19 Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article investigates the economic contribution of tourism to the GDP. We review background methodologies, systematically collect data for EU countries, and develop a sound and ready-to-use procedure for computing indirect and total economic impacts. The routine is then applied to selected destinations for which a minimum standard in the quality of data from Tourism Satellite Accounts and InputCOutput tables is met. Methodologically, the article provides a tool for estimating the total contribution of tourism to output, gross value added, and employment. Empirically, the comparison of results across EU economies shows a high degree of heterogeneity in the tourism share to GDP, which is critically discussed. Our procedure delivers a key tool to researchers, industry leaders, and policy makers willing to investigate income and employment consequences of scenarios differing in the evolution of tourism demand, something of high relevance in the COVID-19 era.

This paper revisits the inequality-growth and poverty-growth links. Using a panel of 158 countries between 1960 and 2010, we find that the correlation of growth with poverty is consistently negative: A 10 p.p. decrease in the headcount poverty rate is associated with a subsequent increase in per capita GDP between 0.5 and 1.2% per year. In contrast, the correlation of growth with inequality is empirically fragileit can be positive or negative, depending on the empirical specification and econometric approach employed. However, the indirect effect of inequality on growth through its correlation with poverty is robustly negative. Closer inspection shows that these results are driven by the sample observations featuring high poverty rates.","output":"Growth, inequality and poverty: a robust relationship?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays are used for epidemiological studies and for the assessment of vaccine responses in highly vulnerable patients. So far, data on cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is limited. Here, we compared four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs; Vircell SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and IgG, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 207 patients with COVID-19, 178 patients with serological evidence of different bacterial infections, 107 patients with confirmed viral respiratory disease, and 80 controls from the pre-COVID-19 era. In COVID-19 patients, the assays showed highest sensitivity in week 3 (Vircell-IgM/A and Euroimmun-IgA: 78.9% each) and after week 7 (Vircell-IgG: 97.9%; Euroimmun-IgG: 92.1%). The antibody indices were higher in patients with fatal disease. In general, IgM/IgA assays had only limited or no benefit over IgG assays. In patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections, IgG assays were more specific than IgM/IgA assays, and bacterial infections were associated with more false-positive results than viral infections. The specificities in bacterial and viral infections were 68.0 and 81.3% (Vircell-IgM/IgA), 84.8 and 96.3% (Euroimmun-IgA), 97.8 and 86.0% (Vircell-IgG), and 97.8 and 99.1% (Euroimmun-IgG), respectively. Sera from patients positive for antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, and Legionella pneumophila yielded particularly high rates of unspecific false-positive results in the IgM/IgA assays, which was revealed by applying a highly specific flow-cytometric assay using HEK 293 T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Positive results obtained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA ELISAs require careful interpretation, especially if there is evidence for prior bacterial respiratory infections.

This study explores (1) the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for older Chinese migrants in Belgium and the Netherlands in terms of increased loneliness and its risk factors (reduced in-person contact, decreased social participation, feelings of existential threat) and protective factors (increased non-in-person contact, more individual activities), and (2) which risk and protective factors have contributed to the incidence and prevention of higher loneliness levels. Using quantitative data of a survey among 98 Chinese migrants aged 50 years and older in Belgium (n = 84) and the Netherlands (n = 14), the findings first indicate that the coronavirus pandemic has a significant impact on older Chinese migrants lives. One in five experienced more loneliness. Second, reduced social participation (measured as less frequent participation in outdoor group activities) and financial insecurity (measured as experiencing financial difficulties) lead to higher than pre-pandemic loneliness levels. Problem-focused coping strategies (measured as increased non-in-person contact, via telephone or social media) and emotion-focused coping (measured as finding distraction through increased participation in individual activities) were not found to protect against increased loneliness in the pandemic. Two practical implications for loneliness interventions for older Chinese migrants are put forward. Organizing COVID-19-safe social participation activities and paying more attention to older Chinese migrants financial situation can be beneficial when addressing higher levels of loneliness due to the coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Older Chinese migrants in coronavirus pandemic: exploring risk and protective factors to increased loneliness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this socio-anthropological study was to establish a foundation for communication recommendations with the potential to increase the demand for tuberculosis (TB) screening in Ivory Coast. The study therefore focused on perceptions of TB likely to be influenced via communication campaigns. METHOD: The study design included a qualitative approach, with semi-structured interviews of 54 persons and 28 focus groups each comprised of 8 persons, as well as a quantitative approach, with a questionnaire distributed to 400 respondents. The study was undertaken in Abidjan, Bouak, Korhogo and San Pdro, Ivory Coast. RESULTS: Amongst the results, this study showed that the population has a robust understanding of the existence and severity of TB and a good understanding of TB symptoms. There is little confidence in traditional medicine to treat TB and there is an awareness that TB can be treated by modern medicine and medications. On the other hand, only half of the population knew that TB treatment is free-of-charge, which could be a contributing factor to patients not seeking treatment. For the vast majority of respondents, there is an association between TB and HIV or AIDS. Fears related to this association are likely to present a significant obstacle to seeking treatment in cases of presumed TB. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we think it is essential to reinforce communication around the availability of free treatment for TB, and to disassociate TB from HIV in communication and awareness-raising tools both for TB and for HIV.","output":"[Tuberculosis communication challenges in Ivory Coast]./ Les enjeux de la communication sur la tuberculose en C?te d'Ivoire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Article by Gopalan and Misra is very informative and covers the current challenges arising due to COVID-19.

Thrombectomy is one of the most challenging surgeries with high rate of perioperative morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanisms driving tumor thrombus formation are poorly understood which is required for designing effective therapy for eliminating tumor thrombus. RESULTS: We perform single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 19 surgical tissue specimens from 8 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients with tumor thrombus. We observe tumor thrombus has increased tissue resident CD8(+) T cells with a progenitor exhausted phenotype compared with the matched primary tumors. Remarkably, macrophages, malignant cells, endothelial cells and myofibroblasts from TTs exhibit enhanced remodeling of the extracellular matrix. The macrophages and malignant cells from primary tumors represent proinflammatory states, but also increase the expression of immunosuppressive markers compared to tumor thrombus. Finally, differential gene expression and interaction analyses reveal that tumor-stroma interplay reshapes the extracellular matrix in tumor thrombus associated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive picture of the ecosystem of ccRCC with tumor thrombus provides deeper insights into the mechanisms of tumor thrombus formation, which may aid in the design of effective neoadjuvant therapy to promote downstaging of tumor thrombus and decrease the perioperative morbidity and mortality of thrombectomy.

Many hospitals limited face-to-face appointments to only the pregnant woman and restricted the number of support people present during labour, birth, and postnatal visits to one person. How these restrictions were experienced by partners and support persons of childbearing women are unknown. AIM: To explore the experiences of partners and support persons of women receiving maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A two-phased qualitative study including an online survey and interviews. Analysis was undertaken using content analysis. FINDINGS: Partners and support persons experienced a sense of 'missing out' from the pregnancy and maternity care experience because of changes in the provision of care during the pandemic. They reported feelings of isolation, psychological distress, and reduced bonding time with babies. Conflicting information and processes within and across maternity services contributed to feelings of uncertainty and a perceived reduction in the quality of care. Partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions on maternity wards, however they also perceived these to be of benefit to women. DISCUSSION: Many partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions in maternity services during the pandemic; strategies to ensure their active involvement in maternity care are needed. CONCLUSION: This study offers insights from the unique perspective of partners and support people of women receiving maternity care during the pandemic. Policies and processes that exclude partners and support persons need to be reconsidered.","output":"Receiving maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experiences of women's partners and support persons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O queijo artesanal tem boa aceita??o, consumo e produ??o em quase todo pas.

To the best of our knowledge, there is not any embracing published review about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS Non-systematic literature review. A search in the PubMed database was performed, with the terms 'psychotropic drugs', 'COVID-19', 'psychiatry' and 'pandemic'. Consensus and clinical guidelines about psychotropic drugs and COVID-19 approach, published by scientific societies, governmental entities and drug regulatory agencies were included. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We present the recommendations about the use of psychotropic drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the outpatient and inpatient settings. The treatment of affective bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have now added increased difficulties. Some psychotropic drugs interfere with the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus infection and they could interact with the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. Some patients will need pharmacological interventions due to the presence of delirium. Smoking cessation changes the serum levels of some psychotropic drugs and may influence their use. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in clinical practice. Psychiatric patients are a vulnerable population and often a careful clinical, laboratorial and electrocardiographic evaluation may be needed, particularly in those diagnosed with COVID-19.

Many strategies have been involved such as suppression and mitigation strategies to deal with this epidemic. In this paper, a new mathematical-engineering strategy is introduced in order to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Thereby, control theory is involved in controlling the unstable epidemic alongside with the other suggested strategies until the vaccine will hopefully be invented as soon as possible. A new robust control algorithm is introduced to compensate the COVID-19 nonlinear system by propose a proper controller after using necessary assumptions and analysis are made. In addition, the Variable Transformation Technique (VTT) is used to simplify the COVID-19 system. Furthermore, the Most Valuable Player Algorithm (MVPA) is applied in order to optimize the parameters of the proposed controller. The simulation results are based on the daily reports of two cities Hubei (China) and Lazio (Italy) since the outbreak.

Previous work has demonstrated that this kernel learning procedure succeeds, assuming a considerable number of observed samples from each distribution. In realistic scenarios with very limited numbers of data samples, however, it can be challenging to identify a kernel powerful enough to distinguish complex distributions. We address this issue by introducing the problem of meta two-sample testing (M2ST), which aims to exploit (abundant) auxiliary data on related tasks to find an algorithm that can quickly identify a powerful test on new target tasks. We propose two specific algorithms for this task: a generic scheme which improves over baselines and a more tailored approach which performs even better. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical evidence that our proposed meta-testing schemes out-perform learning kernel-based tests directly from scarce observations, and identify when such schemes will be successful.","output":"Meta Two-Sample Testing: Learning Kernels for Testing with Limited Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a variety of impacts on the human body. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the pathogen that causes COVID-19.

The available data on stress and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 are relatively limited and have not been evaluated in Russia yet. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The cross-sectional anonymous survey included 1,090 healthcare workers. Stress and anxiety symptoms were assessed using Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 9 (SAVE-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) scales. Logistic regression, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin two component factor model, Cronbach's alpha and ROC-analysis were performed to determine the influence of different variables, internal structure and consistency, sensitivity and specificity of SAVE-9 compared with GAD-7. RESULTS: The median scores on the GAD-7 and SAVE-9 were 5 and 14, respectively. 535 (49.1%) respondents had moderate and 239 (21.9%) had severe anxiety according to SAVE-9. 134 participants (12.3%) had severe anxiety, 144 (13.2%) had moderate according to GAD-7.

In this study, our primary objective was to validate the performance of CASE through a multicenter study in China. METHODS: Between July 2014 and December 2019, 143 consecutive patients with definite neuronal surface antibody-associated AE from three tertiary hospitals were enrolled in the study. We validated the reliability, internal consistency, and validity of CASE. We further compared CASE with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) among different subtypes of AE in terms of its sensitivity to disease dynamics. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism and R software. RESULTS: Our analyses showed that CASE had good inter- and intraobserver reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.96/0.98) and internal consistency (Cronbach  = 0.847) at disease onset. The scores of CASE and mRS remained well correlated in patients at admission and at discharge (both r = 0.80, p < 0.001). From admission to discharge, the scores of CASE changed in 81 (56.6%) patients, in comparison to changes in mRS in 48 (33.6%) patients (p = 0.007 and p < 0.001, respectively). The largest changes in scores occurred for non-motor symptoms, including psychiatric, memory, and language dysfunctions (40.6, 26.6, and 23.1% of patients, respectively); in contrast, scores for motor symptoms, such as dyskinesia, weakness and ataxia, changed the least (7.0, 15.4, and 16.1% of patients, respectively).

These findings were attributed to activation of the inflammatory response with the release of cytokines and immune suppression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of RBC transfusion on the day of surgery and postoperative outcomes following endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). METHODS A total of 510 patients who underwent EVAR from April 2005 to March 2007 were considered for analysis. The exposure of interest was whether or not patients receive RBC transfusion on the day of surgery. The primary outcome was a composite in-hospital morbidity/mortality outcome. The authors assessed the association between RBC transfusion and our composite outcome using logistic regression after adjusting for the available potential confounders using propensity score matching. RESULTS Propensity scores were estimated for 418 out of the 510 patients; 92 patients were not included because of missing data. Propensity matching resulted in 42 successfully matched pairs. Median (quartiles) propensity score was 0.46 (0.28, 0.66) for the matched patients with transfusion and 0.46 (0.29, 0.61) for the matched patients without transfusion (P = .75, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Results of the multivariable model developed after propensity score matching suggest that RBC transfusion was not significantly associated with experiencing a postoperative complication; estimated odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.7 (0.8, 9.0), P = .11.

EVs in China have modest cradle-to-gate CO2 benefits (on average 29%) compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), but have similar carbon emissions relative to hybrid electric vehicles. Well-to-wheel air pollutant emissions assessment shows that emissions associated with ICEVs are mainly from gasoline production, not the tailpipe, suggesting tighter emissions controls on refineries are needed to combat air pollution problems effectively. By integrating a vehicle fleet model into policy scenario analysis, we quantify the policy impacts associated with the passenger vehicles in the major Chinese provinces: broader EV penetration, especially combined with cleaner power generation, could deliver greater air quality and health benefits, but not necessarily significant climate change mitigation.

VTE can be prevented through the provision of non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological thromboprophylaxis following individualised risk screening. The Caprini risk assessment model (RAM) offers a validated and well-established approach for VTE risk assessment in medical inpatients. Literature findings describe a trend towards inappropriate and under-prescribing of thromboprophylaxis in this population. Together with concerns regarding clinicians' perceived importance of VTE risk assessment, the need to clarify these aspects of practice is evident.

Common VTE risk factors identified included bed rest/restricted mobility for <72 hours (76.3%) and serious infection (67.4%). A total of 97.1% of patients (n=369) were found to be at moderate or higher risk of VTE (Caprini score 2). Of this at-risk group, 24.1% were eligible to receive chemoprophylaxis, yet no prescription for thromboprophylaxis was identified. Seventy percent of patients (n=266) were prescribed chemoprophylaxis, with enoxaparin accounting for 98.5% of regimens. Contraindications to chemoprophylaxis were recorded in 13.4% of patients. CONCLUSIONS Although rates of VTE prophylaxis in medical inpatients may be improving, thromboprophylaxis still remains critically underutilised in this population. This study highlighted a consequence of this trend, with inappropriate chemoprophylaxis prescribing becoming more evident. Mechanical prophylaxis prescribing in medical inpatients is lacking, despite the associated benefits. RAMs should be adapted for the SA setting, where infectious diseases are prevalent. Future research should assess RAM use by clinicians, as this could provide insight into improving RAM uptake and thromboprophylaxis prescribing.","output":"Venous thromboembolism risk assessment and prophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients in the Cape Town metropole, South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has modified the way, plastic surgeons treat their patients. This article depicts how we as a plastic surgery department in a tertiary care setup handled the pandemic with an emphasis on infection control policy. Methods Data was collected from hospital records and quality assurance cell from March 21, 2020 to June 19, 2020 in terms of patient triaging, consultations, perioperative protocols, duty rosters, and academic activities. The changes on these with the impact of COVID-19 were studied with the same period of previous year. Results Outpatient clinics were closed and emergency consultations were reduced. Number of consultations reduced from 2591 to 75 and surgeries from 320 to 46 during the same period in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Though tele-consultations were helpful, the overall benefits were subpar. Emergency services continued with the guidelines of institute's infection control committee, such as area specific personal protective equipment, allotment of operating rooms, minimizing the crowd in operating room. There was some compromise in using accessories for microsurgical procedures. Duty rosters were designed to maintain uninterrupted services. Academic activities were continued with virtual platforms. Conclusion Adequate preparation of health care setup and nation-wide lockdown has helped to handle emergency cases and in reduction of trauma-surgeries respectively. Though there were obstacles for some patients in accessing health care, our institutional response made us to render maximum possible care. Advancements in virtual platform helped in consultations and academics.

Chinas internet hospitals vary in sponsorship. However, little is known about patients intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research is to examine patients intention to use virtual visits, as well as virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. In addition, we will identify determinants of patients intention to use virtual visits, as well as intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 1653 participants was conducted in 3-tier hospitals in 3 cities with different income levels in May and June 2019. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors that affect patients intention to use virtual visits. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the determinants of the intention to use virtual visits delivered by different sponsorship types of internet hospitals (ie, enterprise-sponsored, hospital-sponsored, and government-sponsored). RESULTS: A total of 76.64% (1145/1494) of adult participants were online medical information seekers, and 87.06% (969/1113) of online medical information seekers had intention to use virtual visits. Public hospitalCsponsored internet hospitals were the most prevalent ones among Chinese patients (473/894, 52.9%), followed by the provincial government internet hospital platform (238/894, 26.6%), digital health companies (116/894, 13.0%), medical e-commerce companies (48/894, 5.4%), private hospitals (13/894, 1.5%), and other companies (6/894, 0.7%).

Consumers used an additional 10% of the stimulus payment to pay off debt. Consumer spending fell to normal levels after two weeks. Stimulus recipients who live paycheck-to-paycheck spent 60% of the stimulus payment within two weeks, while recipients who save much of their monthly income spent only 24% of the stimulus payment within two weeks. Spending patterns are quite similar for the second round of stimulus payments in January, 2021, with consumers spending 39% of their stimulus payments within two weeks and using an additional 14% of their payment to pay off debt. Reweighting our data to match the U.S. population, ignoring equilibrium effects, and assuming a constant MPC for each person, we estimate that the CARES Acts $296 billion of stimulus payments increased consumer spending by $130 billion (44% of total outlays) within two weeks of stimulus receipt.

DESIGN: Case investigation. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: All 79 residents and 34 health care personnel (HCP) of an NH. METHODS: Seven days after identification of a COVID-19 resident, all residents and HCP underwent real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs. This was repeated weekly in all previously negative subjects until the testing identified no new cases, and in all positive subjects until the testing was negative. COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were implemented in all residents and HCP with positive testing or with COVID-19 symptoms. Standard IPC was also implemented in all HCP. Six weeks after initial testing, all residents underwent testing for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based IgG antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms were serially recorded in residents and HCP. RESULTS: A total of 36 residents had a positive rRT-PCR at baseline and 2 at day 7. Six HCP had a positive rRT-PCR at baseline and 2 at day 7. No new COVID-19 cases were diagnosed later. Among the SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, 6 residents (16%) and 3 HCP (37%) were asymptomatic during the 14 days before testing. Twenty-five residents (92.3%) and all 8 HCP (100%) with a positive rRT-PCR developed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among the residents and HCP always having tested negative, 2 (5%) and 5 (11.5%), respectively, developed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These 2 residents had typical COVID-19 symptoms before and after testing and 2/5 HCP were asymptomatic before and after testing. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study shows the validity of the updated American Testing Guidance for Nursing Homes (NHs). It suggests implementing COVID-19 IPC in both residents and HCP with positive testing or COVID-19 symptoms and warns that asymptomatic HCP with repeated negative rRT-PCR testing can develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Efficacy of a Test-Retest Strategy in Residents and Health Care Personnel of a Nursing Home Facing a COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) can regulate antioxidation and affect many cellular processes. However, the effect of AA on the reproduction of male animals remains less explored. Here, we showed that by supplementing exogenous AA to porcine immature Sertoli cells (iSCs), AA could promote the proliferation, suppress apoptosis, and decrease the global nucleic acid methylation (5 mC and m(6)A) levels of iSCs. After we profiled mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression by transcriptome sequencing on iSCs (treated by 250 M AA for 36 h), 1232 mRNAs and 937 lncRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed (DE). Gene enrichment analysis found multiple significantly enriched biological pathways, including oxidoreductase activity, cell proliferation and apoptosis, regulation of hormone level, regulation of catalytic activity, developmental process, ATP metabolism and reproductive process. Specifically, for the reproductive process, 49 up- and 36 down-regulated DE mRNAs (including highly expressed genes, such as Tfcp2l1, Hmgcs1, Mmp7, Fndc3a, and Zfp36l1) are involved. Moreover, AA supplementation could promote the secretion of anti-mllerian hormone, inhibin B and lactate, and enhance the activity of lactate dehydrogenase as well. Taken together, AA could promote the reproductive function of pig iSCs, potentially through reprogramming the global transcriptome, and elevating hormone secretion and metabolite production.","output":"Ascorbic acid promotes the reproductive function of porcine immature Sertoli cells through transcriptome reprogramming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sarcoidosis causes many disabling symptoms, including fatigue and exercise limitations, which have been shown to improve by physical activity programs The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of continuous activity monitoring using an electronic activity tracker (AT) on exercise performance and fatigue of sarcoidosis patients, compared to controls (cohort study), and the effect of additional personal coaching (randomized trial) over a period of 3 months Fifty-four sarcoidosis patients received an AT (Group Ia: 27 with coaching and Group Ib: 27 without) A historical group of sarcoidosis patients (Group II;n = 41) who did not follow a physical activity program served as controls Exercise performance of patients wearing an AT (Group I) improved compared with controls (Group II), including the 6MWD, % predicted (?4 4  9 1 versus ?0 7  5 0, respectively), and fatigue levels decreased (??3 9  5 7 versus ??1 8  5 3) Patients with coaching (Group Ia) showed greater improvement of exercise capacity over time than patients without coaching (Group Ib) as shown by the Steep Ramp Test results (watts: ?20 2  33 8 versus ?5 7  26 4;and SRT, VO2max, % predicted: ?1 6  2 6 versus ?0 7  2 3) Sarcoidosis patients wearing an AT achieved improvement of exercise performance and reduction of fatigue We therefore recommend encouraging sarcoidosis patients to wear an AT to stimulate physical activity and reduce fatigue The additional benefit of coaching needs to be explored in future studies","output":"Benefit of Wearing an Activity Tracker in Sarcoidosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The SARS-coV-2 pandemic continues to cause an unprecedented global destabilization requiring urgent attention towards drug and vaccine development.

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is associated with cardiometabolic disturbances, is a source of proinflammatory cytokines and a marker of visceral adiposity. We investigated the relation between EAT characteristics and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This post-hoc analysis of a large prospective investigation included all adult patients (&#8805;18 years) admitted to San Raffaele University Hospital in Milan, Italy, from February 25th to April 19th, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) scan for COVID-19 pneumonia and had anthropometric data available for analyses. EAT volume and attenuation (EAT-At, a marker of EAT inflammation) were measured on CT scan. Primary outcome was critical illness, defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU), invasive ventilation or death. Cox regression and regression tree analyses were used to assess the relationship between clinical variables, EAT characteristics and critical illness. One-hundred and ninety-two patients were included (median [25th-75th percentile] age 60 years [53-70], 76% men). Co-morbidities included overweight/obesity (70%), arterial hypertension (40%), and diabetes (16%). At multivariable Cox regression analysis, EAT-At (HR 1.12 [1.04-1.21]) independently predicted critical illness, while increasing PaO2/FiO2 was protective (HR 0.996 [95% CI 0.993; 1.00]). CRP, plasma glucose on admission, EAT-At and PaO2/FiO2 identified five risk groups that significantly differed with respect to time to death or admission to ICU (log-rank p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Increased EAT attenuation, a marker of EAT inflammation, but not obesity or EAT volume, predicts critical COVID-19.

RESULTS: In total, 621 patients presented to the ED with orthopaedic complaints during the pandemic (versus 997 in 2019). However, there was minimal change in the number of ED presentations requiring admission (110 in 2020 versus 116 in 2019). Among patients discharged directly from ED, 27.3% received hospital outpatient referral (versus 39.1% in 2019), with the remaining patients referred to community health services or discharged directly.

In this study, a concentration-determined influence of AVD oseltamivir (OT) was observed on the biochemical pathway of Chlorella sorkiniana (C.S-N1) in synthetic municipal wastewater. The results showed that high OT concentration inhibited biomass growth through increased oxidative stress and restrained photosynthesis.

This creates a gap in their research output that can reduce their chances of winning funding. In Australia, applicants can disclose their career disruptions and peer reviewers are instructed to make appropriate adjustments. However, it is not clear if and how applicants use career disruption sections or how reviewers adjust and if they do it consistently. METHODS: To examine career disruption, we used surveys of the Australian health and medical research community. We used both a random sample of Australian authors on PubMed and a non-random convenience sample. RESULTS: Respondents expressed concerns that sharing information on career disruption would harm their chances of being funded, with 13% saying they have medical or social circumstances but would not include it in their application, with concerns about appearing weak. Women were more reluctant to include disruption. There was inconsistency in how disruption was adjusted for, with less time given for those with depression compared with caring responsibilities, and less time given for those who did not provide medical details of their disruption.

Methods: In this retrospective study, 26 severe patients and 22 critical patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. We recorded the diet and nutritional treatments in severe and critical patients. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of severe and critical patients were also collected. Results: Average calorie intake of severe patients (19.3 kcal/kg/d) was higher than critical patients (15.3 kcal/kg/d) (P = 0.04).

Lower in\\\\hospital pO2/FiO2 correlated with higher BORG scale levels after 6MWT ( 0.27; p 0.04) at follow up visit. FI was positively correlated with length of hospitalization ( 0.3; p 0.03) and negatively with the 6MWT walked distance ( \\\\0.36; p 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: robust and frail patients with COVID\\\\19 ARF treated with NIV outside the intensive care unit setting had good respiratory parameters and exercise capacity at 6\\\\month follow\\\\up, although more severe patients had slightly poorer respiratory performance compared to patients with higher PaO2/FiO2 and lower FI.

Contrary to previous findings with neural cells from the rat (S. Beushausen and S. Dales, 1985, Virology 141, 89C101), these agents show no discrimination in the tropism and have the ability to replicate in either type of murine glial cell. Effects of the differentiation inducer dbcAMP on levels of the myelin-specific enzyme 2:3-cyclic nucleotide-3-phosphohydrolase (CNPase) activity and virus replication were determined. In the mouse system there was a gradual, continuous elevation of CNPase beyond 30 days whereas in comparable rat cell cultures maximum CNPase enhancement is elicited within 21 days (F. A. McMorris,1983, J. Neurochem. 41, 506C515). After dbcAMP treatment replication of both coronaviruses was profoundly suppressed in murine oligodendrocytes, consistent with our findings on JHMV replication in treated rat oligodendrocytes. By contrast the replication of JHMV and MHV3 in dbcAMP-treated murine astrocytes was influenced only marginally. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that susceptibility of rodents to CNS infection by coronaviruses is determined, in part, by the age-related maturation process of oligodendrocytes.","output":"In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases XV.

The main object of the current research was to estimate the antiviral activity of cannabinoids (CBDs) against the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In the presented research work, we performed in silico and in vitro experiments to aid the sighting of lead CBDs for treating the viral infections of SARS-CoV-2. Virtual screening was carried out for interactions between 32 CBDs and the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. Afterward, in vitro antiviral activity was carried out of five CBDs molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, among them, two CBDs molecules namely &#916; (Yu et al., 2020 [9])-tetrahydrocannabinol (IC50a?=a?10.25a?M) and cannabidiol (IC50a?=a?7.91a?M) were observed to be more potent antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2 compared to the reference drugs lopinavir, chloroquine, and remdesivir (IC50 ranges of 8.16-13.15a?M). These molecules were found to have stable conformations with the active binding pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory.

Aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and outcomes of conservative versus surgical management of AA during the pandemic. MATERIALS & METHODS: We conducted an observational study in a tertiary referral centre. Data was collected from patients (16 years) with a diagnosis of AA between 1st November 2019 to 10th March 2020 (pre-COVID period) and 10th March 2020 to 5th July 2020 (COVID period). RESULTS: A total of 116 patients in the pre-COVID period were included versus 91 in the COVID period. 43.1% (n = 50) of patients pre-COVID were classified as ASA 2 compared to 26.4% (n = 24) during the COVID period (p-value=0.042). 72.5% (n = 66) of the patients during the COVID period scored as high risk using the Alvarado score compared to 24.1% (n = 28) in the pre-COVID period (p-value<0.001). We observed a significant increase in radiological evaluation, 69.8% versus 87.5% of patients had a CT in the pre-COVID and COVID periods respectively (p-value=0.008). 94.9% of patients were managed operatively in the pre-COVID period compared to 60.4% in the COVID period (p-value<0.001). We observed more open appendicectomies (37.3% versus 0.9%; p-value<0.001) during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period. More abscess formation and free fluid were found intraoperatively in the COVID period (p-value= 0.021 and 0.023 respectively). Re-attendance rate due to appendicitis-related issues was significantly higher in the COVID period (p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Radiological diagnosis of AA was more frequent during the COVID period. More conservative management for AA was employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for those managed operatively an open approach was preferred. Intra-operative findings were suggestive of delayed presentation during the COVID period without this affecting the length of hospital stay.","output":"P21 Appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: to operate or not to operate, that is the question"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first COVID 19 case of Kuwait was announced on 24th February, 2020 and the daily new cases increases exponentially since then until May, 2020 when the first wave started to decline.

Women with chronic hypertension are easily-recognized and in touch with a wide variety of healthcare providers before, during, and after pregnancy, mandating that chronic hypertension in pregnancy be within the scope of many practitioners. We reviewed recent data on management to inform current care and future research. Study design Narrative review of published literature. Results Compared with normotensive women, women with chronic hypertension are at increased risk of maternal and perinatal complications. Women wish to be involved in their care and are capable of measuring blood pressure (BP) at home. Accurate devices for home BP monitoring are now available. The diagnostic criteria for superimposed preeclampsia remain problematic, as most guidelines continue to include deteriorating BP control in the definition. It has not been established how angiogenic markers may aid in confirmation of the diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia when suspected, over and above information provided by routinely-available clinical data and laboratory results. While chronic hypertension is a strong risk factor for preeclampsia and aspirin decreases preeclampsia risk, the effectiveness specifically among women with chronic hypertension has been questioned. It is unclear whether calcium has an independent effect in preeclampsia prevention in such women. Treating hypertension with antihypertensive therapy halves the risk of progression to severe hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, but a reduction in preeclampsia or serious maternal complications has not been demonstrated; however, the latter lack of evidence is possibly due to few events. Also, treating chronic hypertension neither reduces nor increases fetal/newborn death or morbidity, regardless of the gestational age at which the antihypertensive treatment is started. Antihypertensive agents are not teratogenic, but there may be an increase in malformations associated with chronic hypertension itself. At present, BP treatment targets used in clinic are the same as those used at home; although BP values tend to be inconsistently lower at home among hypertensive women. While starting all women on the same antihypertensive medication is usually effective in reducing BP, it remains unclear whether there is an optimal agent for such an approach, or how best to use combinations of antihypertensive medications. An alternative approach is to individualize care, using maternal characteristics and BP features beyond BP level (e.g., variability) that are of prognostic value. Outcomes may be improved by timed birth between 38+0-39+6 weeks based on observational literature; confirmatory trial evidence is pending. Postnatal care is facilitated by the acceptability of most antihypertensives (included angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors) for use in breastfeeding. Conclusions The evidence base to guide the care of pregnant women with chronic hypertension is growing and aligning international guidance. Addressing outstanding research questions would inform personalized care of chronic hypertension in pregnancy.","output":"TOWARDS PERSONALIZED MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC HYPERTENSION IN PREGNANCY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in individuals with gastrointestinal disease. Multiple care gaps exist for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, resulting in high rates of re-hospitalization (e.g. 44% at 90 days in Alberta). The Cirrhosis Care Alberta (CCAB) is a 4-year multi-component pragmatic trial with an aim to reduce acute-care utilization by implementing an electronic order set and supporting education across eight hospital sites in Alberta. AIMS: As part of the pre-implementation evaluation, this qualitative study analyzed data from provider focus groups to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. METHODS: We conducted focus groups at eight hospital sites with a total of 54 healthcare providers (3C12 per site). A semi-structured interview guide based upon constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Normalization Process Theory (NPT) frameworks was used to guide the focus groups. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data was analyzed thematically and inductively. RESULTS: Five major themes emerged across all eight sites: (i) understanding past implementation experiences, (ii) resource challenges, (iii) competing priorities among healthcare providers, (iv) system challenges, and (v) urban versus rural differences. Site-specific barriers included perceived lack of patient flow, time restraints, and concerns about the quality and quantity of past implementation interventions. Facilitators included passionate project champions, and an ample feedback process. CONCLUSIONS: Focus groups were useful for identifying pre-implementation barriers and facilitators of an electronic orders set. Findings from this study are being refined to address the influence of COVID-19, and the data will be used to inform the intervention roll-out at each of the sites.

We observed deficits in bone density by both tools. pQCT assessments were associated with many of the same clinical parameters as have been previously established for DXA. INTRODUCTION Adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) commonly exhibit bone loss, but effects on bone geometry are less clear. We compared measures obtained by DXA and pQCT in girls with AN. METHODS Seventy females (age 15.5  1.9 years ) with AN and 132 normal-weighted controls underwent tibial measures by pQCT including trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at the 3 % site, cortical vBMD and dimensions at the 38 % site, and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) at the 66 % site. Participants with AN also underwent standard DXA measures. Independent t tests compared the pQCT results, while Pearson coefficient assessed correlations among DXA and pQCT measures. RESULTS Trabecular vBMD Z-scores were lower in AN compared to controls (AN -0.31  1.42 vs +0.11  1.01, p = 0.01) and cortical vBMD Z-scores were higher (AN +0.18  0.92 vs -0.50  0.88, p < 0.001).

METHODS: A monocentric cross-sectional retrospective study of 265 older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 on acute geriatric wards. 11/265 presented a stroke episode during hospitalization. Mortality rates and two-group comparisons (stroke vs non-stroke patients) were calculated and significant variables added in logistic regression models to investigate stroke risk factors.

We first confirm that individuals experience time passing slower than usual during fear or sadness (p = 0.046) and faster than usual during cognitive tasks (p = 2 x 10^-5). Then, we group together the experimental segments associated with fast, slow, and normal POTP, and train a ML model to classify between these states based on a person's biomarkers. The classifier had a weighted average F-1 score of 79%, with the fast-passing time class having the highest F-1 score of 93%.

An additional advantage to the individual is that positive tests may be provided sufficiently early enough during their infection that treatment with antiviral treatments can effectively inhibit development of severe disease, particularly when PCR uptake is limited and delays to receipt of results are substantial. Here, we provide a quantitative illustration of the extent to which rapid tests administered at various intervals can deliver benefits accrued from the novel Pfizer treatment (Paxlovid). We find that strategies for which tests are administered more routinely, i.e. every other day or once every three days, are associated with greater reductions in the risk of hospitalization and correspondingly, higher proportions of the infected population benefiting from treatment.

It is well known that controls can have counterintuitive effects, such as the honeymoon effect, in which partially effective controls cause not only a greater initial reduction in infection than expected for an infection near its endemic equilibrium, but also large outbreaks during control as a result of accumulation of susceptibles. Unfortunately, many control measures cannot be maintained indefinitely, and the results of cessation are not well understood. Here, we examine the results of stopped or failed non-immunizing control measures in endemic settings. By using a mathematical model to compare the cumulative number of cases expected with and without the control measures, we show that deployment of control can lead to a larger total number of infections, counting from the time that control started, than without any control C the divorce effect. This result is directly related to the population-level loss of immunity resulting from non-immunizing controls and is seen in model results from a number of settings when non-immunizing controls are used against an infection that confers immunity. Finally, we also examine three control plans for minimizing the magnitude of the divorce effect in seasonal infections and show that they are incapable of eliminating the divorce effect. While we do not suggest stopping control programs that rely on non-immunizing controls, our results strongly argue that the accumulation of susceptibility should be considered before deploying such controls against endemic infections when indefinite use of the control is unlikely. We highlight that our results are particularly germane to endemic mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue virus, both for routine management involving vector control and for field trials of novel control approaches. Author Summary Many common endemic infections lack effective, inexpensive vaccinations, and control relies instead on transmission reduction, e.g. mosquito population reduction for dengue. Often, these controls are used with the immediate goal of decreasing the current incidence with little importance placed on what will happen at later points in time, and much less what will happen once the control is stopped. Here, by looking at the cumulative incidence since the beginning of the control period, instead of the instantaneous incidence, we show that when controls are stopped, or fail, the resulting outbreaks can be large enough to completely eliminate any benefit of the control. We call this result the divorce effect. Further, we show that this result is not limited to specific transmission pathways or epidemiological parameters, but is instead tied directly to the reduction of herd immunity inherent in non-immunizing controls. Lastly, by evaluating programs to minimize the magnitude of the divorce effect, we show that without maintaining herd immunity, or successfully continuing control for decades, it is impossible to keep the costs of post-control outbreaks from outweighing the benefits of the control program.","output":"After the honeymoon, the divorce: unexpected outcomes of disease control measures against endemic infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and rapid spread of the potentially fatal coronavirus disease 2019, caused due to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, has led to worldwide interest in developing functional bioactive ingredients that act as immunomodulatory agents.

Papaya leaf water extract (PLW) was found to significantly increase the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by upregulating inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclo-oxygenase-2 activity, respectively. Additionally, PLW increased the production of tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin 1 in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, PLW activated the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not that of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results indicate that PLW increased the production of NO, PGE2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines by activating the JNK and ERK pathways in macrophages, thus demonstrating immunomodulatory properties. Finally, high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint analysis indicated the presence of rutin, narirutin, and -coumaric acid in PLW (6.30, 119.76, and 47.25 ppm, respectively).

Here we describe a patient who developed invasive mucormycosis after receiving only a short course of dexamethasone. The purpose is to highlight this atypical presentation of a rare disease. CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and small cell lung cancer with metastasis to the brain presented to the Emergency Department with altered mental status and a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Three weeks before, she had been diagnosed with DM (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 6.5%) and was started on dexamethasone to treat cerebral edema. On admission, her HbA1c was 10.8%, although she had received only a short course of dexamethasone. Her physical exam was concerning for left eyelid swelling and ophthalmoplegia. Computed tomography of the head and neck revealed signs of left ocular proptosis and invasive rhinomaxillary fungal disease. The patient underwent urgent surgical debridement; subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive fungal disease extending into her left inferior frontal lobe. A surgical pathology report was positive for Rhizopus oryzae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Her blood cultures were positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. She was treated with antibiotics and amphotericin B. Her clinical course was complicated by hypokalemia. She eventually recovered and was discharged from the hospital.

All bacteria  1  10(3) cfu/mL were cultured, isolated, identified, and tested for susceptibility to select antimicrobials. RESULTS: In total, 226 of the 234 urine samples were polymicrobial (97%), with an average of 4.7 isolates per weekly specimen. A total of 228 urine samples (97%) exhibited  1  10(6) CFU/mL, 220 (94%) exhibited abnormal urinalysis, 126 (54%) were associated with at least 1 possible sign or symptom of infection, and 82 (35%) would potentially meet a standardized definition of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), but only 3 had a caregiver diagnosis of CAUTI.

A growing body of research has investigated U-VBF in intervention for developmental SSD; however, diversity in study design, participant characteristics, clinical methods and outcomes complicate the interpretation of this literature. Thus, there is a need for a synthesis and review of the evidence base for using U-VBF in intervention for SSD. AIMS To synthesise and evaluate the research evidence for U-VBF in intervention for developmental SSD. METHODS A systematic review was conducted. Eight electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published before 2018. Details about study design, participants, intervention procedures, service delivery, intervention intensity and outcomes were extracted from each study that met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were rated using both a critical appraisal tool and for their reporting of intervention detail. MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS Twenty-eight papers, comprising 29 studies, met the inclusion criteria. The most common research design was single-case experimental design (44.8% of studies). The studies included between one and 13 participants (mean = 4.1) who had a mean age of approximately 11 years (range = 4;0-27 years). Within the research evidence, U-VBF intervention was typically provided as part of, or as an adjunct to, other articulatory-based therapy approaches. A range of lingual sounds were targeted in intervention, with 80.6% of participants across all reviewed studies receiving intervention targeting rhotics. Outcomes following therapy were generally positive with the majority of studies reporting that U-VBF facilitated acquisition of targets, with effect sizes ranging from no effect to a large effect. Difficulties with generalisation were observed for some participants. Most studies (79.3%) were categorised as efficacy rather than effectiveness studies and represented lower levels of evidence. Overall, the reviewed studies scored more highly on measures of external validity than internal validity. CONCLUSIONS The evidence base for U-VBF is developing; however, most studies used small sample sizes and lower strength designs. Current evidence indicates that U-VBF may be an effective adjunct to intervention for some individuals whose speech errors persist despite previous intervention.

METHODS Primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultures established from HIV-1-infected patients were treated with KP in comparison with zidovudine and supernatants and cells were harvested for analysis of HIV RNA and proviral contents, respectively. Virus production in exogenous in-vitro PBMCs infection with lymphocytotropic and monocytotropic HIV-1 strains was also assessed in presence of KP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay HIV p24 gag antigen detection. The binding affinity of KP to CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 was evaluated on CD4-CCR5 or CD4-CXCR4 transfected astroglioma cell lines. RESULTS KP was shown to be devoid of cytotoxicity on PBMCs and to inhibit HIV-1 replication in PBMCs of a patient in the acute phase of infection. The antiretroviral activity of KP, which proved to be more potent than zidovudine at micromolar concentrations, is abolished by beta 1,3-glucan but not by beta 1,6-glucan.

During 2013-2014, approximately one third of children and adolescents (persons aged 19 years) in the United States were reported to use a dietary supplement in the past 30 days, and use varied by demographic characteristics (1,2). Dietary supplements can contribute substantially to overall nutrient intake, having the potential to both mitigate nutrient shortfalls as well as to lead to nutrient intake above recommended upper limits (3). However, because nutritional needs should generally be met through food consumption according to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, only a few dietary supplements are specifically recommended for use among children and adolescents and only under particular conditions (4). The most recently released data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during 2017-2018 were used to estimate the prevalence of use among U.S. children and adolescents of any dietary supplement, two or more dietary supplements, and specific dietary supplement product types. Trends were calculated for dietary supplement use from 2009-2010 to 2017-2018. During 2017-2018, 34.0% of children and adolescents used any dietary supplement in the past 30 days, with no significant change since 2009-2010. Use of two or more dietary supplements increased from 4.3% during 2009-2010 to 7.1% during 2017-2018. Multivitamin-mineral products were used by 23.8% of children and adolescents, making these the products most commonly used. Because dietary supplement use is common, surveillance of dietary supplement use, combined with nutrient intake from diet, will remain an important component of monitoring nutritional intake in children and adolescents to inform clinical practice and dietary recommendations.","output":"Dietary Supplement Use in Children and Adolescents Aged 19 Years - United States, 2017-2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factorspopulation between 20C34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequalityas having strong relationships with R(0), across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive.

The use of modRNA in basic and translational science is rising, due to the clinical potential of modRNA. We are currently using modRNA to induce cardiac regeneration post-ischemic injury. Major obstacles in using modRNA for cardiac ischemic disease include the need for the direct and single administration of modRNA to the heart and the inefficient translation of modRNA due to its short half-life. Modulation of the 5 untranslated region (5 UTR) to enhance translation efficiency in ischemic cardiac disease has great value, as it can reduce the amount of modRNA needed per delivery and will achieve higher and longer protein production post-single delivery. Here, we identified that 5 UTR, from the fatty acid metabolism gene carboxylesterase 1D (Ces1d), enhanced the translation of firefly luciferase (Luc) modRNA by 2-fold in the heart post-myocardial infarction (MI). Moreover, we identified, in the Ces1d, a specific RNA element (element D) that is responsible for the improvement of modRNA translation and leads to a 2.5-fold translation increment over Luc modRNA carrying artificial 5 UTR, post-MI. Importantly, we were able to show that 5 UTR Ces1d also enhances modRNA translation in the liver, but not in the kidney, post-ischemic injury, indicating that Ces1d 5 UTR and element D may play a wider role in translation of protein under an ischemic condition.","output":"Optimization of 5 Untranslated Region of Modified mRNA for Use in Cardiac or Hepatic Ischemic Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of drug resistance among the causative organisms for respiratory tract infections represents a critical challenge to the global health care community.

Currently, treatment is limited to source control and supportive care, albeit with imminent approval of immune modulating drugs for COVID-19-associated lung failure the potential of host-directed strategies appears on the horizon. We suggest expanding the concept of sepsis by incorporating infectious stress within the general stress response of the cell to define sepsis as an illness state characterized by allostatic overload and failing adaptive responses along with biotic (pathogen) and abiotic (e.g., malnutrition) environmental stress factors. This would allow conceptualizing the failing organismic responses to pathogens in sepsis with an ancient response pattern depending on the energy state of cells and organs towards other environmental stressors in general. Hence, the present review aims to decipher the heuristic value of a biological definition of sepsis as a failing stress response.

Using a stapling device, a gastric tube can safely be created in a short amount of time. The problems with gastric tube creation using only linear type staplers include staple overlap as well as the problem of cost associated with using multiple staplers. To address this, both linear and radial type staplers have been introduced. We herein compare three methods of gastric tube creation. METHODS From 2012 to 2014, 62 patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. We evaluated and compared the mean number of stapler loads and cost in each groups. RESULTS The mean number of stapler loads was 6.24 in method A, 5.16 in method B, and 4.33 in method C. The mean cost accounting for total staple fires per case was 3116.07 dollars in the method A group, 2576.74 dollars in the method B group, and 2447.78 dollars in the method C group. Anastomotic leaks developed in 4 cases in the method A group and in 3 cases in the method B group. There were no anastomotic leaks in the method C group.

RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing analysis were used to determine the G (VP7 gene) and P (VP4 gene) genotypes of 26 specimens positive for RVA. A total of 188 specimens (79.3 %) were positive for at least one of the three target enteric pathogens, and 101 samples (42.6 %) harbored mixed infections. The individual prevalence was 57.8 %, 50.6 % and 23.6 % for C. parvum, RVA and BCoV, respectively. Molecular analysis of selected RVA strains revealed the presence of the G6, G10, G3, P[5] and P[11] genotypes, with the combinations G6P[5] and G6P[11] being the most prevalent. Alignments of nucleotide sequences of the VP7 and VP4 markers showed a high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with up to 294 SNPs found in 869bp of sequence at the G6 genotype (0.338 SNPs/nt), which reveals the extensive genetic diversity of RVA strains.

The COVID-19 has prompted an urgent search for effective interventions, and there is little information about the money value of treatments. The present study aimed to summarize economic evaluation evidence of preventing strategies, programs, and treatments of COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and specialized databases of economic evaluation from December 2019 to July 2020 to identify relevant literature to economic evaluation of programs against COVID-19. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts, extracted data from full-text articles, and did their quality assessment by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Then, quality synthesis of results was done. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies of economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. The CHEERS scores for most studies (n = 9) were 85 or higher (excellent quality). Eight studies scored 70 to 85 (good quality), eight studies scored 55 to 70 (average quality), and one study < %55 (poor quality). The decision-analytic modeling was applied to twenty-three studies (88%) to evaluate their services. Most studies utilized the SIR model for outcomes. In studies with long-time horizons, social distancing was more cost-effective than quarantine, non-intervention, and herd immunity. Personal protective equipment was more cost-effective in the short-term than non-intervention. Screening tests were cost-effective in all studies. CONCLUSION: The results suggested screening tests and social distancing to be cost-effective alternatives in preventing and controlling COVID-19 on a long-time horizon.

It is unclear if outcome in trauma patients differs as well. Therefore, this study aims to determine differences in characteristics, therapy and outcome of trauma patients between both German-speaking countries. METHODS: The TraumaRegister DGU(?) (TR-DGU) was used. Patients with Injury Severity Score  9 admitted to a level 1 trauma centre between 01/2009 and 12/2017 were included if they required ICU care or died. Trauma pattern, pre-hospital procedures and outcome were compared between Swiss (CH, n = 4768) and German (DE, n = 66,908) groups. RESULTS: Swiss patients were older than German patients (53 vs. 50 years). ISS did not differ between groups (CH 23.8 vs. DE 23.0 points). There were more low falls < 3 m (34% vs. 21%) at the expense of less traffic accidents (37% vs. 52%) in the Swiss population.

SETTINGS A survey was carried out at the Hong Kong-China cross border checkpoint in the middle of the epidemic. PARTICIPANTS A total of 839 Hong Kong adult residents returning to Hong Kong from mainland China were surveyed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Practice of preventive measures and relevant behaviours and attitudes. RESULTS Around 40% of the respondents were using masks all or most of the time in public places or washing their hands frequently (>10 times per day) and about one third avoided visiting crowded places in mainland China. Such figures were however lower than those practised by the general public in Hong Kong. SARS related perceptions, such as perceived risk of transmission and efficacy, etc, were associated with mask use and not visiting crowded places, but not with hand washing, which was associated with duration of stay. Gender differences were also observed. Around 70% of the travellers would have delayed medical consultation for influenza-like illness in China; 12.7% would not wear masks during such episodes of illness. Furthermore, about 30% of the respondents used to wear masks in Hong Kong but not in mainland China. CONCLUSIONS The findings have implications on cross border prevention of SARS.

Submariners see their mood and cognition deteriorate as their mission progresses. With regard to the benefits of physical activity (PA) on mental health, this study evaluates the impact of regular PA on the maintenance of thymia and sensory functioning during patrols. Method: This pragmatic exploratory cohort follow-up study included 29 volunteer submariners before, during and 1 month after return from patrol. PA practice was evaluated by a daily self-questionnaire. This allowed submariners to be classified into two groups according to the median of the total duration in minutes of a sport practiced during the patrol (PA practicing submariners and non-practicing). Changes in mood and psychological activation, health (including sleep), unipodal stability, and accommodation distances were compared between the two groups over the period of the patrol. Results: Overall thymic functioning deteriorated during the patrol. Submariners who practice PA maintain a stable level of activation unlike non-practicing PA submariners, but they exhibited both worse general health and sleep at recovery. For these personnel, postural control is better at the end of the patrol and far visual accommodation tends to be preserved. Conclusion: PA during patrol alone is not sufficient to compensate for the thymic dysregulation induced by the SSBN environment. Nevertheless, it seems to help in maintaining an exteroceptive functioning. This exploratory study suggests directions for possible future research on physical activity associated with sensory stimulation amongst submariners, and more generally amongst people working in isolated and confined environments.","output":"Is Regular Physical Activity Practice During a Submarine Patrol an Efficient Coping Strategy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mexico is facing a time of change in the allocation and distribution of public funds due to what the Mexican government has called republican austerity.

The shift in the allocation of public spending in Mexico may ultimately deepen in the coming months and couple years, because of the imminent economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

We call this 'retrospective learning'. For example, an intelligence may see a set of pictures of objects, along with their names, and learn to name them. A retrospective learning intelligence would merely be able to name more pictures of the same objects. We argue that this is not what true intelligence is about. In many real world problems, both NIs and AIs will have to learn for an uncertain future. Both must update their internal models to be useful for future tasks, such as naming fundamentally new objects and using these objects effectively in a new context or to achieve previously unencountered goals. This ability to learn for the future we call 'prospective learning'. We articulate four relevant factors that jointly define prospective learning. Continual learning enables intelligences to remember those aspects of the past which it believes will be most useful in the future. Prospective constraints (including biases and priors) facilitate the intelligence finding general solutions that will be applicable to future problems. Curiosity motivates taking actions that inform future decision making, including in previously unmet situations. Causal estimation enables learning the structure of relations that guide choosing actions for specific outcomes, even when the specific action-outcome contingencies have never been observed before. We argue that a paradigm shift from retrospective to prospective learning will enable the communities that study intelligence to unite and overcome existing bottlenecks to more effectively explain, augment, and engineer intelligences.","output":"Prospective Learning: Back to the Future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 by the direct cytopathic effect or indirectly through the propagation of pro-inflammatory cytokines could cause endothelial dysfunction (ED) and oxidative stress (OS). It has been reported that OS is triggered by various types of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Into the bargain, allopurinol is regarded as a potent antioxidant that acts through inhibition of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is an essential enzyme of purine metabolism. Herein, the present study aimed to find the potential protective effects of allopurinol on the biomarkers of OS and ED in patients with severe Covid-19. This single-center cohort study recruited 39 patients with mild-moderate Covid-19 compared with 41 patients with severe Covid-19. Nineteen patients with severe Covid-19 were on the allopurinol treatment because of underlying chronic gout 3 years ago compared with 22 Covid-19 patients not on this treatment. The recruited patients were allocated into three groups: group I, mild-moderate Covid-19 on the standard therapy (n = 39); group II, severe Covid-19 patients on the standard therapy only (n = 22); and group III, severe Covid-19 patients on the standard therapy plus allopurinol (n = 19). The duration of the study was 3 weeks from the time of hospitalization till the time of recovery. In addition, inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, LDH, ferritin, CRP, procalcitonin), neutrophilClymphocyte ratio (NLR), endothelin-1 (ET-1), uric acid and oxidative stress index (OSI), CT scan score, and clinical score were evaluated at the time of admission and discharge regarding the effect of allopurinol treatment adds to the standard treatment of Covid-19. Allopurinol plus standard treatment reduced LDH, ferritin, CRP, procalcitonin, and ET-1 serum level significantly (P < 0.05) compared with Covid-19 patients on standard treatment. Besides, neutrophil (%), lymphocyte (%), and neutrophilClymphocyte ratio (NLR) were reduced in patients with severe Covid-19 on standard treatment plus allopurinol compared with Covid-19 patients on standard treatment alone (P < 0.01). OSI was higher in patients with severe Covid-19 than mild-moderate Covid-19 patients (P = 0.00001) at admission. At the time of discharge, the oxidative status of Covid-19 patients was significantly improved compared with that at admission (P = 0.01). In conclusion, Covid-19 severity is linked with high OS and inflammatory reaction with ED development. High uric acid in patients with severe Covid-19 is correlated with high OS and inflammatory biomarkers. Allopurinol with standard treatment in patients with severe Covid-19 reduced oxidative and inflammatory disorders with significant amelioration of ED and clinical outcomes.","output":"The Prospective Effect of Allopurinol on the Oxidative Stress Index and Endothelial Dysfunction in Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The next fast-spreading infectious threat to community health is out there somewhere.

If the transportation network is not strongly connected, then the model analysis shows that numerous endemic patterns can exist by admitting a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium, which may be disease free in some regions while endemic in other regions. We provide a procedure to detect the disease free and the endemic regions according to the network topology and local reproduction numbers. The main ingredients of the mathematical proofs are the inductive applications of the theory of asymptotically autonomous semiflows and cooperative dynamical systems. We visualise stability boundaries of equilibria in a parameter plane to illustrate the influence of the transportation network on the disease dynamics.

This leads to comparatively high numbers of mental health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in those parents. Intervention approaches for parents of children with IDD are scarce and many parents remain without support. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the feasibility and efficacy of online Narrative Exposure Therapy (eNET) with parents of children with IDD. METHODS: The study follows a randomized waitlist-control design. eNET is an exposure-based PTSD intervention and includes 8C12 90-minute sessions. All sessions will be conducted via video calls with trained paraprofessionals. We aim to include 50 parents, approximately 25 in the immediate intervention group and 25 in the waitlist group. Waitlist participants will receive the same intervention after a three-month wait period. All participants need to either fulfill full or subclinical PTSD symptoms according to DSM-5. Feasibility and efficacy of the intervention will be measured with pre, post, and 2 and 6 months follow-up surveys focusing on PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcomes include other health-related outcomes such as physical symptoms, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms and functionality. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study allows us to test the feasibility and efficacy of eNET in a sample of parents of children with IDD. There are so far no published studies on the evidence of eNET; this study is one of the first randomized controlled trials investigating the feasibility and efficacy of eNET and therefore will have implications on further research and practice.

We aimed to characterize recent COVID-19-related community practice noninvasive diagnostic imaging professional work declines. METHODS: Using imaging metadata from nine community radiology practices across the United States between January 2019 and May 2020, we mapped work relative value unit (wRVU)-weighted stand-alone noninvasive diagnostic imaging service codes to both modality and body region. Weekly 2020 versus 2019 wRVU changes were analyzed by modality, body region, and site of service. Practice share &#967;2 testing was performed. RESULTS: Aggregate weekly wRVUs ranged from a high of 120,450 (February 2020) to a low of 55,188 (April 2020). During that -52% wRVU nadir, outpatient declines were greatest (-66%). All practices followed similar aggregate trends in the distribution of wRVUs between each 2020 versus 2019 week (P = .96-.98). As a percentage of total all-practice wRVUs, declines in CT (20,046 of 63,992; 31%) and radiography and fluoroscopy (19,196; 30%) were greatest. By body region, declines in abdomen and pelvis (16,203; 25%) and breast (12,032; 19%) imaging were greatest. Mammography (-17%) and abdominal and pelvic CT (-14%) accounted for the largest shares of total all-practice wRVU reductions. Across modality-region groups, declines were far greatest for mammography (-92%). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial COVID-19-related diagnostic imaging work declines were similar across community practices and disproportionately impacted mammography.

The practice of sleep tracking and measuring physiological signals in sleep is widely practiced. Therefore, sleep monitoring in both the laboratory and ambulatory environments results in the accrual of massive amounts of data that uniquely positions the field of sleep medicine to gain from AI. METHOD: The purpose of this article is to provide a concise overview of relevant terminology, definitions, and use cases of AI in sleep medicine. This was supplemented by a thorough review of relevant published literature. RESULTS: Artificial intelligence has several applications in sleep medicine including sleep and respiratory event scoring in the sleep laboratory, diagnosing and managing sleep disorders, and population health. While still in its nascent stage, there are several challenges which preclude AIs generalizability and wide-reaching clinical applications. Overcoming these challenges will help integrate AI seamlessly within sleep medicine and augment clinical practice.

We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine, ZF2001, and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy study. METHODS: We did two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Phase 1 was done at two university hospitals in Chongqing and Beijing, China, and phase 2 was done at the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Xiangtan, China. Healthy adults aged 18C59 years, without a history of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection, an RT-PCR-positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, a history of contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, and severe allergies to any component of the vaccine were eligible for enrolment. In phase 1, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive three doses of the vaccine (25 g or 50 g) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive the vaccine (25 g or 50 g) or placebo intramuscularly, 30 days apart, in either a two-dose schedule or a three-dose schedule. Investigators, participants, and the laboratory team were masked to group allocation. For phase 1, the primary outcome was safety, measured by the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. For phase 2, the primary outcome was safety and immunogenicity (the seroconversion rate and the magnitude, in geometric mean titres [GMTs], of SARS-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat and per-protocol basis. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04445194 and NCT04466085) and participant follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between June 22 and July 3, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled into the phase 1 trial and randomly assigned to receive three doses of placebo (n=10), the 25 g vaccine (n=20), or the 50 g vaccine (n=20). The mean age of participants was 326 (SD 94) years. Between July 12 and July 17, 2020, 900 participants were enrolled into the phase 2 trial and randomly assigned to receive two doses of placebo (n=150), 25 g vaccine (n=150), or 50 g vaccine (n=150), or three doses of placebo (n=150), 25 g vaccine (n=150), or 50 g vaccine (n=150). The mean age of participants was 435 (SD 92) years. In both phase 1 and phase 2, adverse events reported within 30 days after vaccination were mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) in most cases (phase 1: six [60%] of ten participants in the placebo group, 14 [70%] of 20 in the 25 g group, and 18 [90%] of 20 in the 50 g group; phase 2: 37 [25%] of 150 in the two-dose placebo group, 43 [29%] of 150 in the two-dose 25 g group, 50 [33%] of 150 in the two-dose 50 g group, 47 [31%] of 150 in the three-dose placebo group, 72 [48%] of 150 in the three-dose 25 g group, and 65 [43%] of 150 in the three-dose 50 g group). In phase 1, two (10%) grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in the 50 g group. In phase 2, grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported by 18 participants (four [3%] in the two-dose 25 g vaccine group, two [1%] in the two-dose 50 g vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, four [3%] in the three-dose 25 g vaccine group, and six [4%] in the three-dose 50 g vaccine group), and 11 were considered vaccine related (two [1%] in the two-dose 25 g vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 g vaccine group, one [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, two [1%] in the three-dose 25 g vaccine group, and five [3%] in the three-dose 50 g vaccine group); seven participants reported serious adverse events (one [1%] in the two-dose 25 g vaccine group, one [1%] in the two-dose 50 g vaccine group, two [1%] in the three-dose placebo group, one [1%] in the three-dose 25 g vaccine group, and two [1%] in the three-dose 50 g vaccine group), but none was considered vaccine related. In phase 2, on the two-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the second dose were 76% (114 of 150 participants) in the 25 g group and 72% (108 of 150) in the 50 g group; on the three-dose schedule, seroconversion rates of neutralising antibodies 14 days after the third dose were 97% (143 of 148 participants) in the 25 g group and 93% (138 of 148) in the 50 g group. In the two-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the second dose were 177 (95% CI 136C231) in the 25 g group and 141 (108C183) in the 50 g group. In the three-dose groups in phase 2, the SARS-CoV-2-neutralising GMTs 14 days after the third dose were 1025 (95% CI 818C1285) in the 25 g group and 691 (530C900) in the 50 g group. INTERPRETATION: The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 appears to be well tolerated and immunogenic. The safety and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 and 2 trials support the use of the 25 g dose in a three-dose schedule in an ongoing phase 3 trial for large-scale evaluation of ZF2001's safety and efficacy.

These skills are used to determine digital readiness of pre-service teachers. The paper reports on validation of an adjusted set of 54 performance statements which were categorized into seven digital learning domains. The seven digital learning domains were validated based on structural equation modelling which was then confirmed by factor analysis using AMOS software. The results of the analysis indicate the existence of a multi-layered model where all digital learning domains are positively connected to each other. Our findings therefore suggest a strong statistical validity of the performance statement inventory. The findings also point to the fact that pre-service teachers are in a transit phase from digital immigrants to digital natives. That, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, implies the need to invest in appropriate preparation and training of pre-service teachers to teach in an online environment. The inventory for measuring digital literacy can be used to assess teachers' digital readiness on a regular basis, thereby enabling them to adjust the teaching materials and pedagogy to achieve the required level of digital readiness, as defined by the school.

Method: ology: We utilized the panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, heterogeneous panel causality test, cross sectional dependence test, cointegration test and Pesaran cross sectional dependent (CADF) unit root test for obtaining estimated results from data over 16 years (2002-2017). Results: : Our results authorize the cointegration among the variables used, where energy consumption, public and private health expenditure and economic growth have positive and statistically significant effects and environmental pollution has both negative and significant effects on the health status of these regions in the long-term, but no panel wise significant impact is found in the short-term. Two-way causal relationships between health status and environmental pollution, public and private health expenditure, economic growth and sanitation facilities, and a one-way causality running from energy consumption to health status are presented. Conclusions: : The improved health status in the SAARC-BIMSTEC region needs to be protected by articulating the effective policies on both public and private health expenditures, environmental pollution, energy consumption, and economic growth.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse medical students' perceptions about the benefits and difficulties of the remote teaching of Pathology during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed with an online survey applied to students from the third and fourth year of medical graduation, who attended the remote teaching of Pathology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online teaching methods consisted of synchronous activities with live interactive lectures, case-based discussions and asynchronous activities with recorded lectures, tutorials and texts available on the online teaching platform. Students' perceptions about the remote teaching of Pathology were assessed through online survey. RESULTS: Ninety students (47.4%) of 190 participants completed the questionnaire, 45 were male and 52 in the third year of medical graduation. Perceived conditions that facilitated Pathology learning included the use of the online teaching platform and time flexibility for study. Students regarded live interactive lectures as superior to traditional face-to-face lectures. Perceived conditions that hindered the implementation of the online teaching included difficulty separating study from home activities, lack of motivation and worsening of quality of life due to physical distancing from colleagues and the faculty. Overall, the remote teaching of Pathology was positively valued by 80% of the students. CONCLUSION: Online tools allowed the content of Pathology to be successfully delivered to the students during the COVID-19 pandemic. This experience may be a model for future teaching activities of Pathology in health science education.","output":"Remote Pathology teaching under the COVID-19 pandemic: Medical students' perceptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic caused by coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) disrupted both public and private life for many.

In this study, we surveyed 2,776 students from nine different countries about changes in their university curricula and potential alterations in their daily habits, physical health, and psychological status. We found negative changes across all countries studied, in multiple categories. We found that 99% of respondents indicated changes in their instruction delivery system, with 90% stating a transition to online education, and 93% stating a reduction or suspension of their practical activities. On average, students spent 8.7 hours a day in front of a screen, with significant differences among countries. Students reported worsened studying, sleeping, and eating habits with substantial differences in Latin American countries. Finally, the participants frequently expressed onset and increase in both mental and physical health symptoms: backache, asthenopia, irritability, and emotional instability.

Our Emergency Department (ED) is the only one in Jersey and it serves 40,000 attendances per year. We had unique challenges during the COVID-19 lockdown given staffing levels, paucity of resources and disruption of strategic links with the NHS. Cancellation of all water and air links left our hospital extremely vulnerable to staff sickness with the inability to access additional workers from the UK or other hospitals. Additionally, overnight a solitary FY2 and 3 nurses staff the department. To combat this, four Watches were created for safe and sustainable cover over a 24 hour period in ED. We are unaware of any other Emergency department in the UK using a similar Watch model.MethodEach Watch consisted of 1 consultant, 2 middle grades, 2 SHOs, 1 Sister, 6 Nurses, 1 HCA, and 2 receptionists. Over 12 weeks, a rota of 12-hour shifts, three days on, three days off were used. Watches did not meet each other to minimise any spread of COVID-19 with handover solely being consultant to consultant. A survey was sent to all staff after the 12 weeks enquiring how it affected morale, the treatment of critically ill patients and how much sick leave was taken in this period. Fifty of sixty people responded to the survey.ResultsOver 12 weeks not a single day of sick leave or isolation was taken. 84% of responders felt the watch system improved morale. 90% agreed it improved the treatment for critically ill patients. 88% want to return to the Watch system if a second wave of COVID-19 occurred. 86% agreed it improved communication and teamwork. 96% agreed the presence of a senior doctor 24h/day had a positive effect on the running of the department.ConclusionA watch based system improved patient and staff safety whilst simultaneously improving staff morale and teamwork during the first wave of COVID-19 at Jersey General Hospital.","output":"The four watches: a small Island approach to COVID-19 in the emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection is causing a pandemic disease that is reflected in challenging public health problems worldwide Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)\\\\based epitope prediction and its association with disease outcomes provide an important base for treatment design A bioinformatic prediction of T cell epitopes and their restricted HLA Class I and II alleles was performed to obtain immunogenic epitopes and HLA alleles from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus Also, a correlation with the predicted fatality rate of hospitalized patients in 28 states of Mexico was done Here, we describe a set of 10 highly immunogenic epitopes, together with different HLA alleles that can efficiently present these epitopes to T cells Most of these epitopes are located within the S1 subunit of the spike protein, suggesting that this area is highly immunogenic A statistical negative correlation was found between the frequency of HLA\\\\DRB1*01 and the fatality rate in hospitalized patients in Mexico Alternate abstract:HighlightsFirst HLA association study for COVID\\\\19 in MexicoAn epitope prediction for HLA Class I and II provided a list of highly immunogenic epitopes from the S protein of SARS\\\\CoV2 with potential use for vaccine development A multi\\\\level approach revealed a correlation of HLA\\\\DRB1*01 frequency with fatality in Mexican hospitalized patients at ecological level","output":"A bioinformatic prediction of antigen presentation from SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 spike protein revealed a theoretical correlation of HLA\\\\DRB1*01 with COVID\\\\19 fatality in Mexican population: An ecological approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The family name of the co-author of the article mentioned above was incorrectly spelled.","output":"Correction to: Incidental lowering of otitis-media complaints in otitis-prone children during COVID-19 pandemic: not all evil comes to hurt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The literature on neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients has been rapidly increasing with the pandemic. However, data on CNS inflammatory disorders in COVID-19 are still evolving. We performed a literature review of CNS inflammatory disorders associated with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We screened all articles resulting from a search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus, using the keywords; \\"SARS-CoV-2 and neurological complication\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complication\\" looking for reports of transverse myelitis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica, myelitis, Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody Disorder (MOGAD), Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Encephalitis/Acute Hemorrhagic Leukoencephalitis (AHNE/AHLE), Cytotoxic lesion of the Corpus Callosum/Mild Encephalopathy Reversible Splenium Lesion(CLOCC/MERS) and Optic neuritis published between December 01, 2019 and March 15, 2021. RESULTS: Our literature search revealed 43 patients meeting the diagnosis of myelitis, including Transverse Myelitis, ADEM, AHNE/AHLE or CLOCC/MERS and Optic neuritis. Acute myelitis was most commonly associated with non-severe COVID-19 and all reported cases of AHNE/AHLE had severe COVID-19 infection. Based on IDSA/ATS criteria of either requiring vasopressor for septic shock or mechanical ventilation, 49% (n = 18) patients were considered to have a severe COVID infection. There were 7 (n = 19%) fatalities. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is among the first reviews that includes the clinical features, neuroimaging, CSF findings and outcomes in COVID-19-associated CNS inflammatory disorders. Our observational review study reveals that although rare, myelitis, ADEM, AHNE and CLOCC can be associated with COVID-19 infection.

It is desirable to determine the pathogen of HFMD accurately and quickly for early treatment. In the current study, reverse-transcription and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technology were developed to detect EV71. The efficacy of detecting EV71 was compared with regular nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After detecting 108 clinical specimens, results showed that RT-LAMP can specifically detect EV71, but not Coxsackie virus A16, and exhibited a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 97.1%, which was higher than regular RT-PCR. The findings indicate that RT-LAMP is a practical method for EV71 diagnostic applications, particularly in small county institutes of medical service.

The pathophysiology of tissue necrosis involves lymphatic congestion, followed by venous congestion and ultimately arterial insufficiency. Topical tacrolimus has been shown to increase growth of lymphatic collateral vessels and decrease lymphedema, potentially obviating one contributor to necrosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the vascular and histological differences between these 2 groups to identify the etiology of our research findings. METHODS: A 3  10-cm cranially based dorsal skin flap was raised and reinset on 22 Sprague Dawley rats. They were randomized to receive 0.2 g of either topical petroleum jelly or topical 0.1% tacrolimus ointment daily to the flaps. The rats were killed 7 days postoperatively. Two blinded reviewers marked the total flap area as well as areas of viable tissue, reversible ischemia, and necrotic tissue. Full-thickness biopsies of each area were taken from 2 randomly chosen animals in each group. Paraffin-embedded tissue was sectioned to generate hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Representative images of each area of the flap were taken less than 40 magnification using light microscopy. Arteries, veins, and lymphatics in the dermal layer were quantified under blinded conditions by a trained pathologist and calculated per cross-sectional area using Fiji software. RESULTS: The average area of the dorsal flaps in the control and tacrolimus groups was 22.5 and 23.9 cm2, respectively. Total necrotic area was significantly lower in rats receiving topical tacrolimus as compared with controls (P = 0.015). In the control cohort, average total number of vessels was 12.5, 6, and 0, in the areas of viable tissue, reversible ischemia, and necrosis, respectively. In the tacrolimus cohort, average total number of vessels increased was 20, 11.5, and 5.4, in the areas of viable tissue, reversible ischemia, and necrosis, respectively.

In this study, we carried out a systematic analysis of clinical characteristics in COVID-19 patients to determine potential risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 virus infection. METHODS: We systematically searched relevant literature published in Pubmed, Embase, Europe PMC, CNKI and other databases. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 16.0. RESULTS: We analysed 5726 confirmed cases from 17 studies. The results indicated that compared with non-cardiac-injured patients, patients with cardiac injury are older, with a greater proportion of male patients, with higher possibilities of existing comorbidities, with higher risks of clinical complications, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU transfer and mortality. Moreover, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, NT-proBNP and blood creatinine in patients with cardiac injury are also higher while lymphocyte counts and platelet counts decreased. However, we fortuitously found that patients with cardiac injury did not present higher clinical specificity for chest distress (P = 0.304), chest pain (P = 0.334), palpitations (P = 0.793) and smoking (P = 0.234). Similarly, the risk of concomitant arrhythmia (P = 0.103) did not increase observably either. CONCLUSION: Age, male gender and comorbidities are risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection. Such patients are susceptible to complications and usually have abnormal results of laboratory tests, leading to poor outcomes. Contrary to common cardiac diseases, cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection did not significantly induce chest distress, chest pain, palpitations or arrhythmias.

We aim to investigate global hospital bed (HB), acute care bed (ACB), and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity and determine any correlation between these hospital resources and COVID-19 mortality. METHOD: Cross sectional study utilizing data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other official organizations regarding global HB, ACB, ICU bed capacity and confirmed COVID-19 cases/mortality. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were performed. RESULTS: 183 countries were included with a mean of 307.1 HBs, 413.9 ACBs, and 8.73 ICU beds/100,000 population. High-income regions had the highest mean number of ICU beds (12.79) and HBs (402.32) per 100,000 population whereas upper-middle income regions had the highest mean number of ACBs (424.75) per 100,000. A weakly positive significant association was discovered between the number of ICU beds/100,000 population and COVID-19 mortality. No significant associations exist between number of HBs nor ACBs per 100,000 population and COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSION: Global COVID-19 mortality rates are likely affected by multiple factors including hospital resources, personnel, and bed capacity. Higher-income regions of the world have greater ICU, acute care and hospital bed capacities. Mandatory reporting of ICU, acute care and hospital bed capacity/occupancy and information relating to coronavirus should be implemented.

The current pandemic is just one sequence in the multiplication of different crises The insight social system of capitalism is subject to the crisis, and that the crisis is an integral part of social equilibrium and social dynamics, is placed in the context of biopolitics and biopower, as well as autophagically intoned natural and demographic selection. The COVID-19 crisis thus imposes a re-examination of the mechanisms of self-regulation of Capitalism through the concept of crisis and risk management, as well as through the discourse of vulnerability and control over nature that has spiraled out of control. The subversive effect of viruses on social organization and social mobilization can be encompassed by the virus theory (Baudrilard), which sees the threat of a virus in the context of the evolutionary supremacy of highly differentiated sociability. This leads to the question of the ontological status of the crisis, as well as its historical continuity/discontinuity. It is proposed to rethink the relationship between crisis, pandemic and death, i.e. the phenomenon of tanatization of Capitalism as well as necrocapitalism itself. In the light of recent discussions, the problem of the relationship between nature and society in the categories of postnaturalism, hybridization, i.e. the permeation of the natural and the social, which leads to the idea of erasing the difference between nature and society, has been especially considered.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Probable SARS as defined by the World Health Organization. RESULTS The index patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, initially without changes to his chest radiograph. Altogether 24 healthcare workers, 15 patients, and 12 family members and visitors were infected. The incubation period ranged from three to eight days. Only 13 patients were isolated on their dates of onset. CONCLUSIONS Atypical presentation of SARS infection must be taken into consideration when managing patients with a history of contact with SARS patients. The main gap in the containment strategy in this outbreak was the failure to identify the index patient as someone who had been discharged from a ward in another hospital that managed probable SARS cases. Strict infection control measures, a good surveillance system, early introduction of isolation procedures, and vigilant healthcare professionals are essential for controlling outbreaks.","output":"Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in a tertiary hospital in Singapore, linked to an index patient with atypical presentation: epidemiological study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), has ravaged the pig industry, causing huge economic loss.

A preliminary study was conducted to better understand the genetic diversity and prevalence of PCV2 genotypes in southern China. We collected 79 random lung samples from pigs with respiratory signs, from 2018 to 2021. We found a PCV2-positivity rate of 29.1%, and frequent co-infections of PCV2 with PCV3, Streptococcus suis (S. suis), and other porcine pathogens. All PCV2-positive samples were sequenced and subjected to whole-genome analysis. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the PCV2 ORF2 gene and complete genomes, found that PCV2 strains identified in this study belonged to genotypes PCV2a (1), PCV2b (6), PCV2d (10), and PCV2e (6). Importantly, PCV2e was identified for the first time in some provinces, including Guangdong and Jiangxi. Additionally, we found two positively selected sites in the ORF2 region, located on the previously reported antigenic epitopes.

Oncologists were advised to prioritize chemotherapy based on the absolute benefit that the patient may receive, which outbalances the risks of Covid-19 infection. The results of this study will allow re-examination of how to approach cancer care during the pandemic and ultimately, help optimize treatment recommendations during this crisis. AIM: This study described the factors contributing to treatment delays during the pandemic and their impact on disease progression. MATERIALS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study was done in St. Luke's Medical Center, a private tertiary healthcare institution based in Metro Manila, Philippines, composed of two facilities in Quezon City and Global City. Patients with solid malignancy with ongoing systemic cancer treatment prior to the peak of the pandemic were identified. Clinical characteristics and treatment data were compared between those with delayed and continued treatments. Multivariate analysis was done to determine factors for treatment delays and association of delays with disease progression and Covid-19 infection. Of the 111 patients, 33% experienced treatment delays and 67% continued treatment during the pandemic. There was a higher percentage of patients on palliative intent who underwent treatment delay, and 64% of delays were due to logistic difficulties. Treatment delays were significantly associated with disease progression (p < .0001). There was no evidence of association between delay or continuation of treatment and risk of Covid-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in Covid-19 infection between those who delayed and continued treatment during the pandemic; however, treatment delays were associated with a higher incidence of disease progression. Our findings suggest that the risks of cancer progression due to treatment delays exceed the risks of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients implying that beneficial treatment should not be delayed as much as possible. Logistic hindrances were also identified as the most common cause of treatment delay among Filipino patients, suggesting that efforts should be focused into assistance programs that will mitigate these barriers to ensure continuity of cancer care services during the pandemic.","output":"Risk factors and clinical outcomes of systemic cancer treatment delays in Filipino patients with solid tumor malignancy during the COVID-19 pandemic: A single tertiary center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An effective monotherapy to target the complex and multifactorial pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a challenge to drug repositioning, which can be improved by combination therapy.

Macrodomains are closely associated with ADP-ribose function and metabolism. ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification controlling various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription and stress response. We found that the viral macrodomains possess broad hydrolase activity towards mono-ADP-ribosylated substrates of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases ARTD7, ARTD8 and ARTD10 (aka PARP15, PARP14 and PARP10, respectively), reverting this post-translational modification both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, the viral macrodomains possess only weak activity towards poly-ADP-ribose chains synthesized by ARTD1 (aka PARP1). Unlike poly-ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase, which hydrolyzes poly-ADP-ribose chains to individual ADP-ribose units but cannot cleave the amino acid side chain - ADP-ribose bond, the different viral macrodomains release poly-ADP-ribose chains with distinct efficiency. Mutational and structural analyses identified key amino acids for hydrolase activity of the Chikungunya viral macrodomain. Moreover, ARTD8 and ARTD10 are induced by innate immune mechanisms, suggesting that the control of mono-ADP-ribosylation is part of a host-pathogen conflict.","output":"The conserved macrodomains of the non-structural proteins of Chikungunya virus and other pathogenic positive strand RNA viruses function as mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the association between the treatment with hydroxychloroquine and mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19.

Research suggests ACP discussions among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) are infrequent overall and may differ by gender and/or race. BACKGROUND: Previous literature has displayed that African Americans are less likely than other racial groups to use advanced care planning, palliative care or hospice, but does not conclusively account for ACP among PLHIV. African American PLHIV rely on informal care that may be differ by gender and represents an important pathway to increase ACP. DESIGN: The study was mixed methods and observational. METHODS: Participants completed self-report surveys (N = 311) and were interviewed (n = 11). Poisson regression (quantitative) and grounded theory analyses (qualitative) were implemented, using COREQ checklist principles to ensure study rigor. RESULTS: Less than half had discussed ACP (41.2%; N = 267). More ACP knowledge predicted 76% lower likelihood of ACP discussions among women. Men who spent more time caregiving in a given week were nearly 3 times more likely to discuss ACP than men who spent less time caregiving. Women were more likely than men to be caregivers and were also expected to serve in that role more than men, which was qualitatively described as 'being a woman'. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is one of few studies exploring ACP among caregivers in African American populations hardest hit by HIV. Results suggest that ACP skill building and education are critical for African Americans living with HIV to promote ACP discussions with their caregivers. Knowledge about ACP topics was low overall even when healthcare had recently been accessed. Support reciprocity and gender-specific communication skill building may facilitate ACP in African American HIV informal caregiving relationships. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Results underscore the need for ACP education which includes healthcare providers and caregivers, given African Americans' preference for life-sustaining treatments at end-of-life. ACP is crucial now more than ever, as COVID-19 complicates care for older adults with HIV at high risk of complications.","output":"'The Woman Gives': Exploring gender and relationship factors in HIV advance care planning among African American caregivers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical image segmentation is one of the major challenges addressed by machine learning methods.

A need for simple, inexpensive techniques to prevent PPH and provide treatment exists, particularly in cases where uterotonics cannot be accessed. Uterine massage is recommended as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labor. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of uterine massage after delivery of the placenta in reducing postpartum blood loss. Thus, a randomized controlled trial was conducted in Turkey between March 2018 and September 2018. A total of 176 pregnant women (88 in the control and 88 in the uterine massage groups) were randomly allocated to the two groups: one group receiving sustained uterine massage, while the other comprising the control group. The uterine massage group was administered transabdominal uterine massage, starting immediately after delivery of the placenta and continuing every 15 min for a duration of 2 h until the uterus hardened. The blood loss within 2 h of delivery was recorded. Level of significance was taken as p < 0.05, and the chi-square, t, and Mann-Whitney U tests as well as Spearman's correlation and linear regression were employed in the analysis of the data. The average amount blood loss within 2 h of the delivery was significantly higher in the control group than in the massage group (X = 170.49  61.46 and X = 186.20  47.59, p < 0.05). A statistically significant difference was present between the uterine massage and control groups in terms of hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, and RCB pre-delivery and pre-discharge (first 24 h) values and in the use of additional uterotonics and the amount of blood loss (p < 0.05).

The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices' security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment.","output":"A Framework for Malicious Traffic Detection in IoT Healthcare Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a rare case of adenoviral pneumonia in a previously healthy pregnant woman at 26(+4) weeks' gestation.

Methods: A structured regimen of remote consultations, conducted by either video-calls, telephone calls, or e-mails, was provided by a multidisciplinary group of physicians to a set of patients of our HHT center. The outcomes considered were: number of emergency room visits/hospitalizations, need of blood transfusions, need of iron supplementation, worsening of epistaxis, and psychological status. Results: The study included 45 patients who received remote assistance for a total of eight months. During this period, 9 patients required emergency room visits, 6 needed blood transfusions, and 24 needed iron supplementation. This was not different from what was registered among the same 45 patients in the same period of the previous year. Remote care also resulted in better management of epistaxis and improved quality of life, with the mean epistaxis severity score and the Euro-Quality of Life-Visual Analogue Scale that were significantly better at the end than at the beginning of the study.

Here, we describe the trial protocol and provide updates thus far.MethodsCRADLE is a parallel, three-arm randomised controlled trial which targets to recruit 750 pregnant women from KK Womens and Childrens Hospital (KKH), Singapore. Participants are randomly assigned to receive: (1) standard routine care;(2) behavioural nudges and engagement via a social media platform;or (3) midwife-led continuity care involving direct individual engagement with midwives throughout pregnancy, to 6-month post-delivery.We hypothesize that the use of virtual targeted nudging tool in the form of text messages along with social media (arm 2), or face-to-face care from midwives supplemented with individualised teleconferencing sessions (arm 3) in the first 1000 days will lead to a better maternal PSE and health outcomes in both mother-child, compared with those who are receiving standard routine care (arm 1).The primary outcome is PSE, while the secondary outcomes include birth experience, mental wellness, feeding practice and nutritional status of mother-child. Participants are followed-up from recruitment visit (early-mid pregnancy) until child turns two years of age. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed using general linear models to test the effects of interventions across three arms.ResultsThe trial was launched on 1 July 2020.

Participants baseline socio-demographic characteristics were similar across three arms, with the mean age of 31 years old, and the mean gestation of 18.1 weeks, at the time of recruitment. In terms of ethnicity, majority of recruited patients were Chinese (71.7%), followed by Malay (8.3%), Others (11.7%) and Indian (8.3%). 90% of the participants were employed, and over 70% of the participants attained tertiary education qualifications.ConclusionsDespite recruitment delay of a few months due to COVID-19, the team was able to recruit 60 participants over 5 months with strict safe distancing measures. Multiple strategies have been established to facilitate the recruitment including extending publicity of the programme within and outside of KKH. The team will initiate preliminary data once 100 participants have been recruited. To engage existing participants, CRADLE will hold its first health education webinar in January 2021. This study may identify a sustainable strategy in the community by helping first-time parents to have a positive experience during the pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood, leading to enhanced PSE and health outcomes for both mother and child.","output":"Trial profile: community enabled readiness for first 1000-days learning ecosystem (CRADLE)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since late 2019, COVID-19 has quickly emerged as the newest biomedical domain, resulting in a surge of new information.

In this study, we assessed how much variability in COVID-19 activity is attributable to city-level socio-demographic characteristics, meteorological factors, and the control measures imposed. We obtained the daily incidence of COVID-19, city-level characteristics, and meteorological data from a total of 102 cities situated in 27 provinces/municipalities outside Hubei province in China from 1 January 2020 to 8 March 2020, which largely covers almost the first wave of the epidemic. Generalized linear mixed effect models were employed to examine the variance in the incidence of COVID-19 explained by different combinations of variables. According to the results, including the control measure effects in a model substantially raised the explained variance to 45%, which increased by >40% compared to the null model that did not include any covariates. On top of that, including temperature and relative humidity in the model could only result in < 1% increase in the explained variance even though the meteorological factors showed a statistically significant association with the incidence rate of COVID-19. In conclusion, we showed that very limited variability of the COVID-19 incidence was attributable to meteorological factors.

The aim of this study was to characterize the suprafascial perforator anatomy of PAPs on preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) and correlate radiological findings with our clinical experience in extremity reconstruction. METHODS: Suprafascial PAP anatomy was reviewed in CTAs in 159 thighs. Findings on CTA were correlated with intraoperative findings in a cohort of patients who had a PAP flap for extremity reconstruction. RESULTS: Two main perforator patterns, a \\"T\\" (superficial bifurcation) and \\"Y\\" (deeper bifurcation) were identified. The ratio between the total skin thickness and the distance from the skin to the perforator bifurcation point and the total skin thickness was higher in the \\"T\\" perforator pattern. A dominant \\"T\\" perforator (n = 97) was more common than \\"Y\\" (n = 62). A dominant \\"T\\" perforator was more common in women and with higher body mass index (BMI). In the clinical study, we found a positive correlation between the skin thickness of the bifurcation point of a dominant \\"T\\" perforator and the thickness of the superficial fascia where a thin PAP flap is elevated.

OBJECTIVES: To understand changes in healthcare service contacts for self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic across primary, emergency and secondary care. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used routine electronic healthcare data for Wales, United Kingdom, from 2016 to March 14, 2021. Population-based data from primary care, emergency departments and hospital admissions were linked at individual-level. All Welsh residents aged 10 years over the study period were included in the study. Primary, emergency and secondary care contacts with self-harm at any time between 2016 and March 14, 2021 were identified. Outcomes were counts, incidence, prevalence and proportion of self-harm contacts relative to all contacts in each and all settings, as well as the proportion of people contacting one or more settings with self-harm. Weekly trends were modelled using generalised estimated equations, with differences between 2020 (to March 2021) and comparison years 2016C2018 (to March 2017C2019) quantified using difference in differences, from which mean rate of odds ratios (ROR) across years was reported. RESULTS: The study included 3,552,210 individuals over the study period. Self-harm contacts reduced across services in March and December 2020 compared to previous years. Primary care contacts with self-harm reduced disproportionately compared to non-self-harm contacts (ROR = 0.7, p<0.05), while their proportion increased in emergency departments during April 2020 (ROR = 1.3, p<0.05 in 2/3 comparison years) and hospital admissions during April-May 2020 (ROR = 1.2, p<0.05 in 2/3 comparison years). Despite this, those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in primary care than other settings compared to previous years (ROR = 1.2, p<0.05). A lower proportion of those with self-harm contacts in emergency departments were subsequently admitted to hospital in December 2020 compared to previous years (ROR = 0.5, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that those who self-harmed during the COVID-19 pandemic may have been less likely to seek help, and those who did so faced more stringent criteria for admission. Communications encouraging those who self-harm to seek help during pandemics may be beneficial. However, this needs to be supported by maintained provision of mental health services.","output":"Healthcare contacts with self-harm during COVID-19: An e-cohort whole-population-based study using individual-level linked routine electronic health records in Wales, UK, 2016March 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new coronavirus disease called COVID-19 was declared by World Health Organization (WHO).

The initial electrical conductivity (EC) of the substrates was 0.3, 0.9, 1.4, 1.9, 2.6, 3.1 and 3.9 dS m-1, respectively. Plant growth, relative water content (RWC), Na, Cl, K, N and P concentrations, membrane injury (MI), chlorophyll and proline levels, as well as gas exchange parameters in leaves of chrysanthemum were determined. A dose-dependent significant reduction of growth and minor decrease of leaf RWC were observed. Foliar Na and Cl concentrations increased with the highest NaCl dose up to 6-fold. However, the concentration of K increased by about 14 %, N by about 5 % but P decreased by about 23 %. Membrane injury was rather low (11 %) even at the highest NaCl dose. Statistically significant decreases of stomatal conductance (20 %), transpiration rate (32 %) and photosynthesis (25 %) were already observed at the lowest NaCl dose and about 40 % decrease of all these parameters with the highest dose. A significant reduction in the intercellular CO2 concentration occurred at the lower NaCl doses and no changes with the highest dose. These results show that in plants grown with the highest NaCl dose, non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis may occur. According to Maas and Hoffman tolerance assessment (1977) chrysanthemum 'Palisade White' may be considered as moderately sensitive to salt stress in terms of growth inhibition. However, it is able to cope with long-term salt stress without any signs of damage, such as chlorophyll depletion, leaf browning or necrotic spots probably due to maintenance of K homeostasis and proline accumulation, which alleviate the toxic effect of chloride.","output":"How chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum  grandiflorum) 'Palisade White' deals with long-term salt stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxylated analog, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are 4-aminoquinoline initially used as an antimalarial treatment.

METHODS Five Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) physicians reviewed the same set of 78 digital otoscope eardrum videos from four eardrum conditions: normal, effusion, retraction, and tympanosclerosis, along with the composite images generated by a SelectStitch method that selectively uses video frames with computer-assisted selection, as well as a Stitch method that incorporates all the video frames. Participants provided a diagnosis for each item along with a rating of diagnostic confidence. Diagnostic accuracy for each pathology of SelectStitch was compared with accuracy when reviewing the entire video clip and when reviewing the Stitch image. RESULTS There were no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy for physicians reviewing SelectStitch images and full video clips, but both provided better diagnostic accuracy than Stitch images. The inter-reader agreement was moderate. CONCLUSIONS Equal to using full video clips, composite images of eardrums generated by SelectStitch provided sufficient information for ENTs to make the correct diagnoses for most pathologies. These findings suggest that use of a composite eardrum image may be sufficient for telemedicine approaches to ear diagnosis, eliminating the need for storage and transmission of large video files, along with future applications for improved documentation in electronic medical record systems, patient/family counseling, and clinical training.

This hypermethylation affects the binding of transcription factors including those involved in exit from the GC reaction and involves pathways such as B cell receptor, antigen presentation, CD40, and others. Normal GC B cells manifest a typical hypomethylation signature, which is caused by AID, the enzyme that mediates somatic hypermutation.

Methods: The MGH Covid-19 Registry includes confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients hospitalized at MGH and is based on manual chart reviews and data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs). We evaluated differences between White/Non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients in demographics, complications and 14-day outcomes among the N=866 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 from March 11, 2020 - May 4, 2020. Results: Overall, 43% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 were women, median age was 60.4 [IQR = (48.2, 75)], 11.3% were Black/non-Hispanic and 35.2% were Hispanic. Hispanic patients, representing 35.2% of patients, were younger than White/non-Hispanic patients [median age 51y; IQR = (40.6, 61.6) versus 72y; (58.0, 81.7) (p<0.001)]. Hispanic patients were symptomatic longer before presenting to care (median 5 vs 3d, p=0.039) but were more likely to be sent home with self-quarantine than be admitted to hospital (29% vs 16%, p<0.001).

The samples were collected across 10 states covering different zones within India. Given the importance of this information for public health response initiatives investigating transmission of COVID-19, the sequence data is being released in GISAID database. This information will improve our understanding on how the virus is spreading, ultimately helping to interrupt the transmission chains, prevent new cases of infection, and provide impetus to research on intervention measures. This will also provide us with information on evolution of the virus, genetic predisposition (if any) and adaptation to human hosts. One thousand and fifty two sequences were used for phylodynamic, temporal and geographic mutation patterns and haplotype network analyses. Initial results indicate that multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating in India, probably introduced by travel from Europe, USA and East Asia. A2a (20A/B/C) was found to be predominant, along with few parental haplotypes 19A/B. In particular, there is a predominance of the D614G mutation, which is found to be emerging in almost all regions of the country. Additionally, mutations in important regions of the viral genome with significant geographical clustering have also been observed. The temporal haplotype diversities landscape in each region appears to be similar pan India, with haplotype diversities peaking between March-May, while by June A2a (20A/B/C) emerged as the predominant one. Within haplotypes, different states appear to have different proportions. Temporal and geographic patterns in the sequences obtained reveal interesting clustering of mutations. Some mutations are present at particularly high frequencies in one state as compared to others. The negative estimate Tajimas D (D = ?2.26817) is consistent with the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 population in India.

Viral RNA testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was conducted March 3 through November 2, 2020. IMRS used published sex-specific weightings and associations were evaluated for the composite of COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality.Findings: Among 3,883 patients, 8.2% were hospitalized, 1.6% died. Subjects with low, mild, moderate, and high-risk IMRS had the composite endpoint in 3.5% (52/1,502), 8.6% (108/1,256), 15.5% (152/979), and 28.1% (41/146), respectively.

Overall, climate change has already led to and will continuously lead to environmental tipping points and irreversible lock-ins that will decrease the common welfare. When taking a closer look at the macroeconomic growth prospects as measured in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per country, a changing climate will affect countries differently, when considering different mean temperatures but also differences in the GDP sector composition per country and a differing peak temperature per GDP sector for optimal production levels. Within society, climate change has a disparate impact of sustainability on female. Female are traditionally the household caretakers who face a disproportional burden of sustainability pledges. As economic gains and losses from a warming earth are distributed unequally within society, ethical imperatives lead to the pledge to redistribute economic opportunities due to climate change to parts of society that lose from global warming in the quest for climate justice. While between countries but also over generations differences in climate change gains and losses lead to unique and unprecedented tax-and-bonds climate change gains and losses distribution strategies, climate justice fairness within society will require novel ways of measuring, monitoring and distributing gains and burdens distribution strategies, also between household members. The regular redistribution mechanisms of taxation, as used between countries or consumers, and climate bonds with diversified interest rates and maturity yield regimes, as a rebalancing between generations, needs to be extended on the gender imbalance and family or community level. The novel policy recommendation of this chapter calls for more interpersonal research on climate change burden sharing and socio-psychological mechanisms such as trust, future orientation, compassion and social responsibility C all powerful female attributes that can drive climate leadership-in-action. We will need redistribution mechanisms that are more diversified than monetary redistribution to shift and balance gender interactions that have gotten skewed due to climate change.

Our goal was to describe the epidemiological profile and the factors related to mortality and survival of patients with stage 5 (CKD) on chronic dialysis hospitalized for Covid-19 in a public hospital. Methods: Retrospective case series. Patients with stage 5 CKD, older than 18 years, hospitalized for Covid-19 infection were included. The primary data source was medical records. The clinical and epidemiological profile of the study sample and the factors related to mortality and survival are described. Results: 105 medical records of patients with CKD 5 were evaluated. 57 (54,29%) were male, with a mean age of 58,59 +/- 14,3 years. 84 (80%) patients survived and 21 (20%) died. The main cause of admission to hospitalization was respiratory failure in (80) 76,2%. The hospital stay was 11,76 +/- 7,8 days. In the bivariate analysis: the increase in leukocytes, D dimer, ferritin, CRP, LDH and the decrease in lymphocytes, pH, bicarbonate and PaO2/FiO2 were related to mortality. In the multivariate analysis, only CRP> 10 mg/dl [HR: 10.72 (95% CI 1,4-81,58)] and a PaO2/FiO2 [] 150 mmHg [HR: 44,40 (95% CI 5,86-336,06)] they were factors related to poor survival.

Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda inclusive, implemented lockdowns, curfew, banning of both private and public transport systems, and mass gatherings to minimize spread. Social control measures for COVID-19 are reported to increase violence and discrimination globally, including in Uganda as some may be difficult to implement resulting in the heavy deployment of law enforcement. Media reports indicated that cases of violence and discrimination had increased in Uganda's communities following the lockdown. We estimated the incidence and factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination among Ugandans during the COVID-19 lockdown to inform control and prevention measures. METHODS: In April 2020, we conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data under the International Citizen Project (ICP) to assess adherence to public health measures and their impact on the COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda. We analyzed data on violence and discrimination from the ICP study. We performed descriptive statistics for all the participants' characteristics and created a binary outcome variable called experiencing violence and/or discrimination. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination. RESULTS: Of the 1726 ICP study participants, 1051 (58.8%) were males, 841 (48.7%) were currently living with a spouse or partner, and 376 (21.8%) had physically attended work for more than 3 days in the past week. Overall, 145 (8.4%) experienced any form of violence and/or discrimination by any perpetrator, and 46 (31.7%) of the 145 reported that it was perpetrated by a law enforcement officer. Factors associated with experiencing violence or discrimination were: being male (AOR = 1.60 CI:1.10-2.33), having attended work physically for more than 3 days in the past week (AOR = 1.52 CI:1.03-2.23), and inability to access social or essential health services since the epidemic started (AOR = 3.10 CI:2.14-4.50). CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of Ugandan residents experienced violence and/or discrimination during the COVID-19 lockdown, mostly perpetrated by law enforcement officers. We recommend mitigation of the collateral impact of lockdowns with interventions that focus on improving policing quality, ensuring continuity of essential services, and strengthening support systems for vulnerable groups including males.","output":"Violence and discrimination among Ugandan residents during the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibacterial activities of novel organoarsenic compounds As(III)-containing Schiff bases on Escherichia coli (CCTCCAB91112) were investigated by microcalorimetry in this study.

Specifically, the growth rate constant k decreased, and the generation time t G and the inhibitory ratio I (percentage) increased with the increased dose of the arsenicals as inhibitors. All of the arsenicals display the feature of considerable lag phase inhibition on the cell growth.

On the other hand, elucidating the interplay between folding mechanisms and function is challenging in large proteins, given the inherent shortcomings in identifying metastable states experimentally and the sampling limitations associated with computational methods. Here, we show that free energy profiles and surfaces of large systems (>150 residues), as predicted by a statistical mechanical model, display a wide array of folding mechanisms with ubiquitous folding intermediates and heterogeneous native ensembles. Importantly, residues around the ligand binding or enzyme active site display a larger tendency to partially unfold and this manifests as intermediates or excited states along the folding coordinate in ligand binding domains, transcription repressors, and representative enzymes from all the six classes, including the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and the protease Mpro. It thus appears that it is relatively easier to distill the imprints of function on the folding landscape of larger proteins as opposed to smaller systems. We discuss how an understanding of energetic-entropic features in ordered proteins can pinpoint specific avenues through which folding mechanisms, populations of partially structured states and function can be engineered.","output":"Folding Intermediates, Heterogeneous Native Ensembles and Protein Function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important source of proteins, fibers and minerals for humans, being grown mainly in developing countries and representing a source of income for small farmers.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on severe COVID-19 patients with hyper-inflammatory features admitted outside intensive care units (ICUs). Patients treated with intravenous TCZ in addition to standard of care were compared to patients treated with standard of care alone. Safety and efficacy were assessed over a 28-day follow-up. RESULTS: 65 patients were included. Among them, 32 were treated with TCZ. At baseline, all patients were on high-flow supplemental oxygen and most (78% of TCZ patients and 61% of standard treatment patients) were on non-invasive ventilation. During the 28-day follow-up, 69% of TCZ patients experienced a clinical improvement compared to 61% of standard treatment patients (p = 0.61). Mortality was 15% in the tocilizumab group and 33% in standard treatment group (p = 0.15). In TCZ group, at multivariate analysis, older age was a predictor of death, whereas higher baseline PaO2:FiO2 was a predictor of clinical improvement at day 28.

The virus causes severe respiratory problems and with an R0 of 5.7, spreads at a rapid rate. At the time of writing, there were over 85 million cases and 1.8 million deaths caused by COVID-19. In the proposed methodology, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have been trained, with the help of transfer learning, to learn to identify whether a suspected patient is suffering from this disease using their chest CT scan image. Transfer learning technique enables the transfer of knowledge from pre-trained models which have been previously trained on extremely large datasets. Various DCNN models have been applied such as AlexNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and VGG-19. The DCNNs were evaluated on a set of 2,481 chest CT scan images. Various performance metrics (Accuracy, MCC, Kappa, F1 score, etc.) were calculated for all DCNN models to enable their comparative evaluation. After extensive testing, ResNet50 was found to give the best results in this binary classification task. The highest accuracy achieved was 97.37% and highest kappa was 0.947.

While general anesthesia (GA) is typically administered for ORIF, recent studies have also demonstrated promising results with the usage of regional anesthesia (RA) in the surgical treatment of distal radius fractures. This study will compare complication rates between the use of RA versus GA for ORIF of DRFs. METHODS: A multi-institutional surgical registry was utilized to identify patients who had undergone ORIF for DRFs from 2005 to 2018these patients were stratified into GA and RA cohorts. Patients were matched utilizing coarsened-exact-matching (CEM) to compare postoperative outcomes and rates of 30-day complications were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Upon CEM-matching, 1191 patients receiving RA were matched to 9250 patients who had received GA, with a multivariate imbalance measure (L1) statistic of < 0.001. In the matched-cohort analysis, no significant differences were observed in rates of any complication (all p  0.083). On multivariate regression analyses, RA was not associated with increased risk for any complication (p = 0.445), minor complications (p = 0.093), major complications (p = 0.758), unplanned reoperations (p = 0.355), unplanned readmissions (p = 0.799), or mortality (p = 0.579). CONCLUSION: With similar safety profiles, RA is a safe and reasonable alternative to GA when managing DRFs surgically. RA may be the preferred anesthetic technique for ORIF of DRFs in patients at high risk with GA, such as those with reactions to GA in the past or with significant cardiopulmonary risk factors.

Seroepidemiologic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a major metropolitan region of the US was performed. METHODS: Children and adolescents 19 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from July-October 2020 in Northern Virginia, US. Demographic, health, and COVID-19 exposure information was collected, and blood analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein total antibody. Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were analyzed. Orthogonal antibody testing was performed, and samples were evaluated for responses to different antigens. RESULTS: In 1038 children, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody positivity rate was 8.5%. After multivariate logistic regression, significant risk factors included Hispanic ethnicity, public or absent insurance, a history of COVID-19 symptoms, exposure to person with COVID-19, a household member positive for SARS-CoV-2 and multi-family or apartment dwelling without a private entrance. 66% of seropositive children had no symptoms of COVID-19. Secondary analysis included orthogonal antibody testing with assays for 1) a receptor binding domain specific antigen and 2) a nucleocapsid specific antigen had concordance rates of 80.5% and 79.3% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A much higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by seropositivity, was found in children than previously reported; this was also higher compared to adults in the same region at a similar time. Contrary to prior reports, we determined children shoulder a significant burden of COVID-19 infection.

As the US Census Bureau projects that the number of Americans ages 65 and older will double by 2060, reducing loneliness is imperative. Personal voice assistants (PVAs) such as Amazon's Echo offer the ease-of-use of voice control with a friendly, helpful artificial intelligence. This study aimed to understand the influence of a PVA on loneliness reduction among adults of advanced ages, i.e., 75+, and explore anthropomorphism as a potential underlying mechanism. Participants (N = 16) ages 75 or older used an Amazon Echo PVA for 8 weeks in an independent living facility in the Midwest. Surveys were used to collect information about perceived loneliness, and PVA interaction data was recorded and analyzed. Participants consistently exceeded the required daily interactions. As hypothesized, after the first 4 weeks of the intervention, aging adults reported significantly lower loneliness (baseline mean = 2.22, SD = 0.42; week 4 mean = 1.99, SD = 0.45, Z = ?2.45, and p = 0.01). Four dominant anthropomorphic themes emerged after thematic analysis of the entire 8 weeks' PVA interaction data (Cohen's Kappa = 0.92): (1) greetings (user-initiated, friendly phrases); (2) comments/questions (user-initiated, second-person pronoun), (3) polite interactions (user-initiated, direct-name friendly requests), (4) reaction (user response to Alexa). Relational greetings predicted loneliness reductions in the first 4 weeks and baseline loneliness predicted relational greetings with the PVA during the entire 8 weeks, suggesting that anthropomorphization of PVAs may play a role in mitigating loneliness in aging adults.","output":"Reducing Loneliness Among Aging Adults: The Roles of Personal Voice Assistants and Anthropomorphic Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Short Birth Interval negatively affects the health of both mothers and children in developing nations, like, Ethiopia. However, studies conducted to date in Ethiopia upon short birth interval were inconclusive and they did not show the extent and determinants of short birth interval in developing (Afar, Somali, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz) regions of the country. Thus, this study was intended to assess the short birth interval and its determinants in the four developing regions of the country. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Demographic and Health Survey program official database website (http://dhsprogram.com). A sample of 2683 women of childbearing age group (15C49) who had at least two alive consecutive children in the four developing regions of Ethiopia was included in this study. A multilevel multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the independent predictors of short birth interval and Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC) was used during the model selection procedure. RESULTS: In this study, the prevalence of short birth interval was 46% [95% CI; 43.7%, 47.9%]. The multilevel multivariable logistic regression model showed women living in rural area [AOR = 1.52, CI: 1.12, 2.05], women attended secondary education and above level [AOR = 0.27, CI: 0.05, 0.54], have no media exposure [AOR = 1.35, CI: 1.18, 1.56], female sex of the index child [AOR = 1.13, CI:1.07,1.20], breastfeeding duration [AOR = 0.79, CI: 0.77, 0.82], having six and more ideal number of children [AOR = 1.14, CI: 1.09, 1.20] and having preferred waiting time to birth two years and above [AOR = 0.86, CI: 0.78, 0.95] were the predictors of short birth interval.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of patients receiving urgent care at a university center for dental medicine (Basel, Switzerland) during the 6-week lockdown, pre-lockdown, and post-lockdown periods were retrospectively evaluated. Statistical analysis involved tests for equal proportions and logistic regression models. The level of significance was set at =0.05. RESULTS: The study comprised 3109 dental emergency visits in the period from February 2 to June 5, 2020. Daily caseloads increased during lockdown. Abscesses, orthodontic emergencies, and surgical follow-ups were more common during lockdown, whereas the number of dento-alveolar injuries declined (0.048). Urgent dental care provision involved intraoral radiographs more frequently in the pre-lockdown period compared with the following weeks (p<0.001). Among all treatments, aerosol-generating procedures dropped from 56.1% (pre-lockdown) to 21.3% during lockdown (p<0.001), while teledentistry follow-ups became more frequent (p<0.001). Patients with comorbidities sought urgent dental care less frequently during the post-lockdown period (p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown significantly impacted the dental emergency service in terms of patients diagnoses, treatment needs, and the characteristics of the urgent care that was delivered.

Data from the literature in Jordan are scarce, especially during the second wave of the pandemic. We aimed to assess medical students level of fear, prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptomsrepresented in psychological distress (PD)and sleep quality (SQ) amid the current pandemic of COVID-19. A total of 2104 students were included through convenient sampling from the six schools of Medicine in Jordan. Online-based questionnaire using Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) scale, Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), and Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) was used to collect the data. Chi-square, t-tests, and ANOVA were used to establish the associations. RESULTS: 88.4% and 47.4% of the students were found to have PD and poor or just fair sleep quality on SQS, respectively, with PD ranging from mild (18.6%) to severe (42.1%). Calculated FCV-19S score was 14.62 (SD=5.38), indicating high level of fear. Students with excellent SQ had significantly lower rates of depression, anxiety, and PD as compared to those with good, fair, and poor SQ (P < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSION: Jordanian medical students appear to be especially susceptible to COVID-19 pandemic impact on mental health and reported high rates of PD. While rates of COVID-19 fear are still considered high, they are remarkably lower than that reported in early studies. We strongly recommend providing resources and access to professional mental health care to students reporting poor SQ and/or symptoms of anxiety and depression.

This study explored nurses and midwives knowledge and experiences of infection prevention and control (IPC) processes and cleaning, and perceptions about workplace risk-management during COVID-19. METHODS: Six registered and enrolled nurses (one with dual midwife qualifications) were recruited. In-depth telephone interviews were analysed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. RESULTS: Four major themes were identified: Striving towards environmental cleanliness; Knowledge and learning feeds good practice; There's always doubt in the back of your mind; and COVID has cracked it wide open. These articulate the nurses and midwives experiences and knowledge of IPC, particularly during COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The findings emphasise the dynamic, interdependent nature of clinical (time, staff knowledge and compliance, work processes, hospital design) and organisational contexts and environmental cleanliness, which must be constantly maintained. COVID-19 opened up critical insights regarding poor past practices and lack of IPC compliance. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has highlighted the criticality of environmental cleanliness within clinical and community settings. Evidence-based, experiential learning is important for nurses and midwives at all career stages, but provides only one solution.

They can encourage positive behaviors and discourage harmful behaviors, and they can enhance or worsen health, health equity, health disparities, and health literacy. Recognizing their contribution to conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age, and people's experiences of these conditions, the US Department of Health and Human Services considered the roles of law and policy throughout its development of Healthy People 2030. Laws and policies often interrelate, but they have different purposes. A law is an established procedure, standard, or system of rules that members of a society must follow. A policy is a decision or set of decisions meant to address a long-term purpose or problem. Healthy People 2030 offers an opportunity for users in diverse sectors and at all levels to use laws and policies to support or inform the initiative's implementation, address health disparities and health inequities, and improve health and well-being in this decade.

However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic had a serious impact on the mobility habits of the population, with a substantial reduction in the number of public transport passengers due to the fear of contagion, which raises questions about the future sustainability of cities. Thus, it is essential to restore the confidence of travelers to feel safe and comfortable using public transport services. Taking advantage of the widespread use of mobile technologies, this article intends to propose a route planning system for public transport that meets the needs of passengers in terms of safety and comfort. After a systematic review of the existing literature and a series of focus group sessions, a prototype of the system was developed, and subsequently evaluated by potential users through usability tests. The results obtained are a good indicator of the systems functionality and ease of use. This assessment allowed us to corroborate the potential that the proposed route planning system has in promoting the use of public transport services as a means of mobility.","output":"Restart: A Route Planner to Encourage the Use of Public Transport Services in a Pandemic Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present study is to check the relationship between virus detection on the conjunctival swabs by RT-PCR and the systemic and ocular clinical data, treatments, and to the modalities of administration of supplemental oxygen.

The IC50 value of S-HCQ was higher than 20 M against hERG channel, which was much less active over all tested CQ and HCQ compounds. Moreover, S-HCQ alone did not prolong QT interval in guinea pigs after 3 days and 6 days of administration, indicating a much lower cardiac toxicity potential.

The case study was about the Brazilian organization ?nima Educa??o, which is the greatest among the five largest publicly traded education companies in Brazil. Secondary data collection and content analysis was carried out. Findings: As emotional response toward the problems caused by the pandemic, the company's leadership adopted an empathic behavior, allowing traces of its empathic culture to emerge. Empathy was expressed through the implementation of SR practices aimed at workers (policy of not firing in the first two months of the pandemic), at students (provision of technological apparatus, online classes, physical/psychological assistance and negotiation of late fees) and at the society (assistance to the elderly). Originality/value: It was concluded that empathy can be taken as the emotional motivator for companies to engage in SR practices, especially in extreme circumstances in society, as the economic and health challenges that the world is experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic nowadays.

Rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family, is the primary etiological agent of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that rotavirus replication induces a MAVS-dependent type I IFN response that involves both RIG-I and MDA5, two cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors. This study reports the isolation and characterization of rotavirus RNAs that activate IFN signaling. Using an in vitro approach with purified rotavirus double-layer particles, nascent single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) transcripts (termed in vitro ssRNA) were found to be potent IFN inducers. In addition, large RNAs isolated from rotavirus-infected cells six hours post-infection (termed in vivo 6 hr large RNAs), also activated IFN signaling, whereas a comparable large RNA fraction isolated from cells infected for only one hour lacked this stimulatory activity. Experiments using knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts showed that RIG-I is required for and MDA5 partly contributes to innate immune signaling by both in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNAs. Enzymatic studies demonstrated that in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples contain uncapped RNAs with exposed 5 phosphate groups. RNAs lacking 2-O-methylated 5 cap structures were also detected in the in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that the rotavirus VP3 enzyme, which encodes both guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities, is not completely efficient at either 5 capping or 2-O-methylation of the 5 cap structures of viral transcripts, and in this way produces RNA patterns that activate innate immune signaling through the RIG-I-like receptors.","output":"Characterization of Rotavirus RNAs That Activate Innate Immune Signaling through the RIG-I-Like Receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 crisis brought numerous challenges to work life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed our radio frequency ablation database of patients with renal masses undergoing laparoscopic or computerized tomography guided percutaneous radio frequency ablation with simultaneous peripheral fiberoptic thermometry from November 2001 to January 2011 at a single tertiary care center. Data were collected on patient demographics, and surgical and clinicopathological outcomes stratified by approach. RESULTS A total of 298 patients with 316 renal tumors underwent laparoscopic (122 tumors) or computerized tomography guided (194 tumors) radio frequency ablation. There were no statistically significant differences between the laparoscopic and computerized tomography guided radio frequency ablation groups with respect to patient demographics, complication rates and renal functional outcomes (p>0.05). The 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimation of radiographic recurrence-free probability was 95% for computerized tomography guided radio frequency ablation and 94% for laparoscopic radio frequency ablation (p=0.84). Subanalysis of the 212 (67%) renal cell carcinoma tumors showed a 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimation of oncologic recurrence-free probability (post-ablation biopsy proven viable tumor) of 94% for computerized tomography guided radio frequency ablation and 100% for laparoscopic radio frequency ablation (p=0.16).

Specifically, this flexibility allows for the analysis of which terms in the expansions of the Hamiltonian and dipole surface lead to the largest corrections to the energies and transition intensities, and how these conclusions depend on the coordinates used for these expansions. Comparisons of corrections to transition frequencies are reported for the Morse oscillator when the potential is expanded in r and Morse coordinates as well as for water, water dimer, and peroxynitrous acid when the molecular Hamiltonians and dipole surfaces are expanded in Cartesian displacement coordinates and in the displacements of the bond-angle-dihedral internal coordinates.

Tracer particles are introduced in the flow to capture the emulated turbulent jet formed due to a sneeze. The visualization is accomplished using a camera and laser illumination. It is observed that a typical sneeze can travel up to 25 ft in 22 s in a quiescent environment. This highlights that the present widely accepted safe distance of 6 ft is highly underestimated, especially under the act of a sneeze. Our study demonstrates that a three-layer homemade mask is just adequate to impede the penetration of fine-sized particles, which may cause the spreading of the infectious pathogen responsible for COVID-19. However, a surgical mask cannot block the sneeze, and the sneeze particle can travel up to 2.5 ft. We strongly recommend using at least a three-layer homemade mask with a social distancing of 6 ft to combat the transmission of COVID-19 virus. In offices, we recommend the use of face masks and shields to prevent the spreading of droplets carrying the infectious pathogen. Interestingly, an N-95 mask blocks the sneeze in the forward direction; however, the leakage from the sides and top spreads the sneeze in the backward direction up to 2 ft. We strongly recommend using the elbow or hands to prevent droplet leakage even after wearing a mask during sneezing and coughing.","output":"Experimental visualization of sneezing and efficacy of face masks and shields"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) now is considered a global public health emergency. One of the unprecedented challenges is defining optimal therapy for those patients with severe pneumonia and systemic manifestations of COVID-19. Optimal therapy should be largely based on the pathogenesis of infections caused by this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the onset of COVID-19, there have been many prepublications and publications reviewing the therapy of COVID-19 as well as many prepublications and publications reviewing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews that link COVID-19 therapies to the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. In order to link COVID-19 therapies to pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a comprehensive search through MEDLINE, PubMed, medRxiv, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel 2019 coronavirus, pathology, pathologic, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, coronavirus pneumonia, coronavirus infection, coronavirus pulmonary infection, coronavirus cardiovascular infection, coronavirus gastroenteritis, coronavirus autopsy findings, viral sepsis, endotheliitis, thrombosis, coagulation abnormalities, immunology, humeral immunity, cellular immunity, inflammation, cytokine storm, superantigen, therapy, treatment, therapeutics, immune-based therapeutics, antiviral agents, respiratory therapy, oxygen therapy, anticoagulation therapy, adjuvant therapy, and preventative therapy. Opinions expressed in this review also are based on personal experience as clinicians, authors, peer reviewers, and editors. This narrative review linking COVID-19 therapies with pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in 6 major therapeutic goals for COVID-19 therapy based on pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. These goals are listed below: 1. The first goal is identifying COVID-19 patients that require both testing and therapy. This is best accomplished with a COVID-19 molecular test from symptomatic patients as well as determining the oxygen saturation in such patients with a pulse oximeter. It can be argued that whether a symptomatic respiratory illness is COVID-19, influenza or another respiratory pathogen, an oxygen saturation less that 90% means that the patient requires medical assistance. 2. The second goal is to correct the hypoxia. This goal generally requires hospitalization for oxygen therapy; other respiratory-directed therapies such as prone positioning or mechanical ventilation are often used in the attempt to correct hypoxemia due to COVID-19. 3. The third goal is reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, there would be an oral antiviral agent available such as seen with the use of oseltamivir phosphate for influenza. This oral antiviral agent should be taken early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an oral agent is not available yet. Currently, two options are available for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. These are post-Covid-19 plasma with a high neutralizing antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 or intravenous remdesivir; both options require hospitalization. 4. The fourth goal is to identify and address the hyperinflammation phase often seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Currently, fever with an elevated C-reactive protein is useful for diagnosing this hyperinflammation syndrome. Low-dose dexamethasone therapy currently is the best therapeutic approach. 5. The fifth goal is to identify and address the hypercoagulability phase seen in many hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patient who would benefit from anticoagulation therapy can be identified by a marked increase in D-dimer and prothrombin time with a decrease in fibrinogen. To correct this disseminated intravascular coagulation-like phase, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin is preferred. Anticoagulation therapy with unfractionated heparin is preferred in COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injuries. 6. The last goal is prophylaxis for persons who are not yet infected. Potential supplements include vitamin D and zinc. Although the data for such supplements is not extremely strong, it can be argued that almost 50% of the population world-wide has a vitamin D deficiency. Correcting this deficiency would be beneficial regardless of any impact of COVID-19. Similarly, zinc is an important supplement that is important in one's diet regardless of any effect on SARS-CoV-2. As emerging therapies are found to be more effective against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms identified, they can be substituted for those therapies presented in this review.

Inspired by the growth of the enterprise, in August 2020, and at the height of the national lockdown necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, Nomjana decided to open a company-owned outlet in Johannesburg miles away from the Cape. However, the launch of this company-owned outlet was not successful. The failure of the Johannesburg outlet left him with a dilemma, as he had planned to scale up his enterprise into other cities in South Africa. Launching his business in Cape Town had not been a challenge, but he struggled to launch outlets of his social enterprise outside of the Western Cape Province.

This unexpected devastating phenomenon, raised a great deal of concerns and anxiety among people around the world and imposed a huge economic burden on the nations' health care systems. Accordingly, clinical scientists, pharmacologists and physicians worldwide felt an urgent demand for a safe, effective therapeutic agent, treatment strategy or vaccine in order to prevent or cure the recently-emerged disease. Initially, due to lack of specific pharmacological agents and approved vaccines to combat the COVID-19, the disease control in the confirmed cases was limited to supportive care. Accordingly, repositioning or repurposing current drugs and examining their possible therapeutic efficacy received a great deal of attention. Despite revealing promising results in some clinical trials, the overall results are conflicting. For this reason, there is an urgent to seek and investigate other potential therapeutics.

We measured sensitization using the calculated panel reactive antibody value for a large cohort of 147 461 patients added to the US OPTN/United Network for Organ Sharing kidney transplant waitlist between December 2014 and December 2019. We used multinomial logistic modeling to compare 62 510 sensitized patients to 84 955 unsensitized controls. RESULTS. We found that the number of homozygous HLA loci was strongly associated with the level of sensitization. Within mildly, highly, or extremely sensitized candidates, women displayed a higher relative abundance of HLA homozygosity at multiple HLA loci as compared with men, with attenuation of this effect in Black candidates. In a multivariable logistic model, the number of homozygous HLA loci interacted with female sex but not with other factors associated with sensitization, including recipient ethnicity and a history of prior kidney transplant.

We hypothesized that the degree of psychological impact would be higher for surgical providers deployed for COVID-19 work, certain surgical specialties, and for those who knew of someone diagnosed with, or who died, of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a global web-based survey to investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19. The primary outcomes were the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores. RESULTS: 4283 participants from 101 countries responded. 32.8%, 30.8%, 25.9% and 24.0% screened positive for depression, anxiety, stress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) respectively. Respondents who knew someone who died of COVID-19 were more likely to screen positive for depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD (OR 1.3, 1,6, 1.4, 1.7 respectively, all p < 0.05).

Design: Scoping review Search strategy: We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PTSDpubs for published literature up to March 2020 for any studies that examined the treatment of PTSD in adults who were vulnerably housed. Websites of relevant organizations and other grey literature sources were searched to supplement the electronic database search. The characteristics and effect of the interventions were analyzed. We also explored how the interventions were delivered and the elements of trauma-informed care that were described. Results: 26 studies were included. We identified four types of interventions: (1) trauma focused psychotherapies; (2) non-trauma psychotherapies; (3) housing interventions; and (4) pharmacotherapies. The trauma-informed interventions were small case series and the non-trauma focused therapies included four randomized controlled trials, were generally ineffective. Of the ten studies which described trauma-informed care the most commonly named elements were physical and emotional safety, the experience of feeling heard and understood, and flexibility of choice. The literature also commented on the difficulty of providing care to this population including lack of private space to deliver therapy; the co-occurrence of substance use; and barriers to follow-up including limited length of stay in different shelters and high staff turnover. Conclusions: This scoping review identified a lack of high-quality trials to address PTSD in the vulnerably housed. There is a need to conduct well designed trials that take into account the unique setting of this population and which describe those elements of trauma-informed care that are most important and necessary.","output":"Interventions to treat post-traumatic disorder (PTSD) in vulnerably housed populations and trauma-informed care: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated difficulties in the functioning of agricultural enterprises, in our opinion, new approaches are required to improve the efficiency of agricultural enterprises. The economic efficiency of an agricultural enterprise depends to a large extent on the efficiency of its personnel. In our opinion, human resources are one of the most important resources in the agricultural business. In this paper, we considered the use of grading to motivate employees of an agricultural enterprise. In our opinion, this will assist in the formation of a clear and transparent system of payment for work activities for the company's employees and, in addition, will optimize the size of the company's employee compensation fund. The system of management of labor resources of the agricultural enterprise should take into account the personality of the employee, knowledge of his features of motivation, and also be combined with the goals and objectives that the enterprise has. ?

The purpose of this study was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical activity of pediatricians. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional and descriptive online survey among pediatricians practicing in Cameroon. Data were collected through an anonymous pretested Google Form?. Results: Among the 118 pediatricians eligible for the survey, 101 responded (85.6%) of whom 61.2% were women. The pediatric outpatient consultations dropped significantly from 60.4% of pediatricians seeing more than 30 patients per week before the pandemic to 9.9% during the pandemic (p < 0.000). According to the occupancy rate of hospitalization beds, 45.5% of pediatricians reported having 76C100% of pediatric hospitalization beds occupied per week before the pandemic but no pediatrician reported a similar rate during the pandemic (p < 0.000). There was a significant increase in the use of telehealth, ranging from no pediatrician using telehealth very frequently before the pandemic to 23.8% using it during the pandemic (p < 0.000). Most of the pediatricians had at their disposal surgical masks (96%), care gloves (80.2%), hydroalcoholic gel (99.0%), and soap and water (86.1%). For the management of children, 90.1% and 71.3% of pediatricians experienced difficulties accessing COVID-19 PCR and chloroquine, respectively, and 74.3% declared difficulties for proper isolation of patients. More than half (65.3%) of the pediatricians interviewed were very afraid or extremely afraid of being infected with SARS-Cov-2, respectively, 45.5% and 19.8%. The most frequent reasons included fear of infecting their relatives (85.1%) and of developing a severe form of the disease (43.6%). The reluctance to consult health services expressed by the parents was due to: fear of being infected when leaving their home and especially in the health facility (96%), strict compliance with confinement (30.7%), and financial difficulties of families (13.9%). Conclusion: This work highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the clinical activity of Cameroonian pediatricians. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a significant drop in the use of health facilities, which probably has a negative impact on childrens overall level of health. Although the preventive measures explain this drop in attendance at health facilities, the parents fear of being infected when leaving the house was the predominant reason likely to explain this drop in attendance at health facilities. This could constitute an axis for developing messages to parents to encourage a gradual return to child health services.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatricians clinical activity in Cameroon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite vaccination, a substantial proportion of immunocompromised patients have an increased risk for severe Covid-19.

However, there is no definitive information regarding the type of clinical specimens that is the best for SARS-CoV-2 detection, the antibody levels in patients with different duration of disease, and the relationship between antibody level and viral load. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs, saliva, blood, and urine specimens were collected from patients with a course of disease ranging from 7 to 69 days. Viral load in different specimen types was measured using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Meanwhile, anti-nucleocapsid protein (anti-N) IgM and IgG antibodies and anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain (anti-S-RBD) IgG antibody in all serum samples were tested using ELISA. RESULTS: The positive detection rate in nasopharyngeal swab was the highest (54.05%), followed by anal swab (24.32%), and the positive detection rate in saliva, blood, and urine was 16.22%, 10.81%, and 5.41%, respectively. However, some patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs had other specimens tested positive. There was no significant correlation between antibody level and days after symptoms onset or viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Other specimens could be positive in patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs, suggesting that for patients in the recovery period, specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs should also be tested to avoid false negative results, and anal swabs are recommended. The antibody level had no correlation with days after symptoms onset or the viral load of nasopharyngeal swabs, suggesting that the antibody level may also be affected by other factors.","output":"Analysis of viral load in different specimen types and serum antibody levels of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Recently, there have been several studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, these studies have mainly been concentrated in Wuhan, China; the sample sizes of each article were different; and the reported clinical characteristics, especially blood biochemical indices, were quite different. This study aimed to summarize the blood biochemistry characteristics of COVID-19 patients by performing a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies. Methods Comprehensive studies were screened from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through March 11, 2020. The inclusion criteria included studies investigating the biochemical indexes of patients with COVID-19. The statistical software R3.6.3 was used for meta-analysis. Results Ten studies including 1745 COVID-19 patients met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that 16% and 20% of patients with COVID-19 had alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels higher than the normal range, respectively. Thirty-four percent of patients showed albumin (ALB) levels lower than the normal range, and 6% of patients showed abnormal total bilirubin (TBil) levels. The levels of creatinine (CRE) were increased in 8% of patients. The creatine kinase (CK) level of 13% of patients exceeded the normal range, and 52% of patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In addition, six studies met the inclusion criteria for the systemic review evaluating the relevance between LDH levels and the severity of COVID-19, and all six studies showed a positive association between these two factors. Conclusions Some patients with COVID-19 had different degrees of blood biochemical abnormalities, which might indicate multiple organ dysfunction. Some biochemical indexes, such as abnormal ALB and LDH, could reflect the severity of the disease to a certain extent. These blood biochemical indicators should be considered in the clinical management of the disease.","output":"Blood biochemical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a systemic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has forced universities worldwide to seek urgent solutions to reconfigure traditional education programs for distance learning The transformation process faces a number of complexities deriving from both institutional and contextual factors It may generate threats and as well as opportunities to enhance the education system and prepare for potential future emergencies In this article, we adopted a combined research approach to describe the experience of the Contamination Lab of the University of Salento (CLab@Salento), an entrepreneurship education program focused on innovative and technology-based entrepreneurship for university students Moving from the analysis of the main challenges the pandemic generated for the institution, students and faculty, we illustrate the process of redesigning the entrepreneurial learning program by leveraging digital technologies We show a new approach to entrepreneurial storytelling, pitching and business planning and development through digital technologies We also report the outcomes of a student survey to highlight the strengths of the redesigned program and some weaknesses, especially associated with digital technologies' limitations in education, which represent areas for future improvement The study contributes at theory level with a new discussion on digital-supported entrepreneurship education At practitioner level, it offers insights on redesigning traditional university programs to effectively address emergencies","output":"Threat or opportunity?

BBM offers a holistic approach to weight loss, recognising that mental health, family and cultural factors all play essential and critical role in nutrition and physical activity patterns. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of BBM for sustained health and wellbeing outcomes among its predominantly Pacific and Mori participants for both general BBM members and those with morbid obesity attending the From the Couch programme. METHODS: Quasi-experimental pre-post quantitative cohort study design with measured or self-reported weight at various time intervals for both cohorts. Weight will be analysed with general linear mixed model for repeated measures, and compared with a prediction model generated from the literature using a mixed method meta-analysis. The secondary outcome is change in pre- and post scores of Mori scale of health and well-being, Hua Oranga. DISCUSSION: Multiple studies have shown that many diet and physical activity programmes can create short-term weight loss. The fundamental question is whether BBM members maintain weight loss over time. In New Zealand, Pacific and Mori engagement in health enhancing programmes remains an important strategy for achieving better health and wellbeing outcomes, and quality of life. Internationally, the collectivist cultures of indigenous and migrant and minority populations, living within dominant individualist western ideologies, have much greater burdens of obesity. If BBM members demonstrate sustained weight loss, this culturally informed community-based approach could benefit to other indigenous and migrant populations.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate (per 100 000) of all-cause mortality and causes of death in the European Shortlist for Causes of Death from March to May 2020. The rates were age standardised and adjusted to a 100% register coverage and compared with a 95% prediction interval (PI) from linear regression based on corresponding rates for 2010C2019. RESULTS: 113 710 deaths were included, of which 10 226 were from 2020. We did not observe any deviation from predicted total mortality. There were fewer than predicted deaths from chronic lower respiratory diseases excluding asthma (11.4, 95% PI 11.8 to 15.2) and from other non-ischaemic, non-rheumatic heart diseases (13.9, 95% PI 14.5 to 20.2).

Removal of these cytokines by therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) prior to end-organ damage may improve clinical outcomes. This manuscript is intended to serve as a preliminary guidance document for application of TPE in patients with severe COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The available literature pertaining to the role of TPE for treatment of COVID-19 patients was reviewed to guide optimal management. It included indication, contraindication, optimal timing of initiation and termination of TPE, vascular access and anticoagulants, numbers and mode of procedures, outcome measures and adverse events. RESULTS: Out of a total of 78 articles, only 65 were directly related to the topic. From these 65, only 32 were acceptable as primary source, while 33 were used as supporting references. TPE in critically ill COVID-19 patients may be classified under ASFA category III grade 2B. The early initiation of TPE for 1-15 patient's plasma volume with fresh frozen plasma, or 4-5% albumin or COVID-19 convalescent plasma as replacement fluids before multiorgan failure, has better chances of recovery. The number of procedures can vary from three to nine depending on patient response. CONCLUSION: TPE in COVID-19 patients may help by removing toxic cytokines, viral particles and/or by correcting coagulopathy or restoring endothelial membrane. Severity score (SOFA & APACHE II) and cytokine levels (IL-6, C-reactive protein) can be used to execute TPE therapy and to monitor response in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Understanding the role of therapeutic plasma exchange in COVID-19: preliminary guidance and practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of the current work is evaluate phytochemicals in Azadirachta indica (Indian Lilac; Neem) and Ocimum sanctum (Holy Basil; Tulsi) extracts and study the anti-biofilm activity alone or in-combination against MRSA.

Both Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum extracts were detected with alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, sugars and protein. The crude extracts maximally inhibited biofilm formation of MRSA1 at 60-70%. The concentrated extract of Azadirachta indica dose-dependently inhibited the biofilm formation of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and Cresistant S. aureus strains (MRSA1 and MRSA2) with maximum inhibition of 67, 50 and 45% respectively.

However, clinical efficacy and safety of concomitant administration of Remdesivir and Dexamethasone (Rem-Dexa) in severe COVID-19 patients on high flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective cohort study that was performed in two medical Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of a tertiary university hospital. The clinical impact of Rem-Dexa administration in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19, who required NIV or HFOT and selected on the simplified acute physiology score II, the sequential organ failure assessment score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index score, was investigated. The primary outcome was 28-day intubation rate; secondary outcomes were end-of-treatment clinical improvement and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, laboratory abnormalities and clinical complications, ICU and hospital length of stay, 28-day and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: We included 132 patients and found that 28-day intubation rate was significantly lower among Rem-Dexa group (19.7% vs 48.5%, p<0.01). Although the end-of-treatment clinical improvement was larger among Rem-Dexa group (69.7% vs 51.5%, p = 0.05), the 28-day and 90-day mortalities were similar (4.5% and 10.6% vs. 15.2% and 16.7%; p = 0.08 and p = 0.45, respectively).

In therapy-refractory patients, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) was used since the early beginning. However, potential developments in vv-EMCO therapy still need to be proven. Methods Between 2020 and 2021 a total of n=60 patients were treated with vv-ECMO for severe COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome in our department. The patients were prospectively enrolled into an institutional database, followed-up and subsequent retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided concerning the date of vv-ECMO onset into three groups (03/2020-09/2020: 1. wave, n=11;10/2020-02/2021: 2. wave, n=23;03/2021-08/2021: 3. wave, n=26). Results From the first to the third wave, patients seemed to be younger, more likely to be female as well as more likely obese. While patients of the first wave regularly developed acute kidney failure (81.3 %), these adverse event was seldom in the second (21.7) and third wave (15.4 5)(p=0.01). In contrast to that, other device-related complications such as stroke, bleeding or visceral ischemia did not differ between the three waves. Most apparent changes during the pandemic were prolonged ECMO support duration (1. wave: 8.5  2.1, 2. wave: 54.0  122.7, 3. wave: 28.0  18.6), ECMO weaning rate (1. wave: 18.2 %, 2. wave: 39.1, 3. wave: 44.0 %) and in-hospital mortality (1. wave: 81.8 %, 2. wave: 69.6, 3. wave: 56.0 %), although none of these effects reached statistical significance. Conclusion Although our data cover only a small study population, we observed clear trends towards younger and heavier patients during the pandemic. Most likely, due to a learning effect, support duration of ECMO patients distinctly increased during the pandemic. Subsequently, weaning and survival also increased. However, differences in patient selection could act as a major confounder for these results.","output":"Changes in Therapy Outcome of Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Therapy-Refractory COVID-19 Infections Throughout the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may have critical implications for our understanding of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals. To this end, we extensively investigated the memory B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in 150 adults sampled pre-pandemically.

Due to the pandemic crisis, in many nursing homes and hospitals, there established new policies on decreasing unnecessary medications to minimize cross-contamination. Sometimes these policies are making providers avoid essential drugs such as Vitamins, including Vitamin D. In this paper, we try to emphasize the importance of Vitamin D in COVID-19 and respiratory viral patients. RELEVANCE: Vitamin D helps in decreasing the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs and acts in immunomodulatory function, and also it will increase the anti-inflammatory, antiviral responses of the respiratory epithelial cells during infection. CONCLUSION: Due to the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and the increased morbidity and mortality with no appropriate therapy and vaccine, one must be cautious and do everything to help COVID-19 patients. In hospitals and other health care settings to decrease cross-contamination, holding other non-essential medications is taking place. Discontinuing Vitamins could increase the mortality and morbidity of those affected, especially in deficient/insufficient individuals. Obtaining serum 25 (OH) D levels in all patients with viral respiratory infections, especially COVID-19, could help in the detection and treatment of Vitamin D deficiency and potentially decrease recovery time and improve outcome. Even though evidence suggests that vitamin D has the anti-inflammatory, antiviral properties, randomized double-blinded controlled trials are needed to verify this further, and to understand Vitamin D and COVID-19 better.

Cooperation between these professionals ensures the integrated management of patients with infectious diseases and the appropriate use of antimicrobials in hospitals. The COVID-19 pandemic forced hospital pharmacists to abruptly suspend all their structured activities and concentrate on the health crisis. Realtime information sharing between different medicine specialties is an effective strategy to generate and maintain treatment protocols adapted to each center, with continuous evidence-based modifications as new publications appear. Hospital pharmacies had to reorganize their activities to respond to the pandemic. On the one side were patients with COVID-19, and on the other were routine hospital pharmacy tasks, with the added difficulty of adapting to individual protection measures. New communication and collaboration strategies were adopted. Protocols were established for the management of COVID-19 patients, with continuous changes; special medications had to be prepared and distributed; circuits were designed for the home- or institution-based care of patients; internal circuits were created to minimize the movements of hospital staff and professionals caring for COVID-19 patients. The most effective antiviral drug and anti inflammatory therapy remains elusive. In this scenario, hospital pharmacists emerge as a key player, as they have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of action of drugs and potential interactions. In a setting where experimental drugs preferably tested in clinical trials are being used, the role of hospital pharmacists in interdisciplinary teams has become essential for the optimization of clinical outcomes.","output":"La farmacia hospitalaria en el equipo multidisciplinar de las unidades COVID de hospitalizacin./ Hospital Pharmacy in the multidisciplinary team of COVID inpatient units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emissions from motor vehicles are the main cause of declining air quality in cities in Europe, China, Asia etc The state of atmospheric air in Kharkiv is analyzed One of the main sources of pollution in Kharkiv is vehicle emissions The most polluted areas of the city of Kharkiv were identified regardint to the observations of the Kharkiv Regional Center for Hydrometeorology due to the AQI Research during quarantine Covid19 showed that level of air pollution has decreased Analysis of the methods and measures to reduce emissions of air pollutants has shown that they are unsystematic This chapter focuses on the systematic optimization of measures considering the technical requirements of cars, drivers and sanitary requirements of pedestrians, that can be used to prescribe appropriate measures at different stages of the system roadCenvironment operation Offered method is illustrated by an example on the experimental section of Jubilee Avenue in the city of Kharkiv and were proposed the urban planning measures for re-duce emissions of air pollutants ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Analysis of the Air Quality in Considering the Impact of the Atmospheric Emission from the Urban Road Traffic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Peripartum is a period of profound hormonal changes in the body and COVID\\\\19 seems to have an additional impact on these women's psychosocial functioning.

Revealing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and control efficiency is important for containing the spread of the virus. Methods: : By using a logistic growth model, we estimated the transmission parameters of COVID-19 in China and six other countries (Republic of Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, France and Germany). The transmission parameters represent the maximum daily increase rate in the early stages of the epidemic and the control efficiency under human intervention. The control efficiency was determined by the significant decrease of the daily increase rate in time and cumulative cases. Results: : We found the daily increase rate of cumulative cases of COVID-19 decreased significantly in both time and cumulative cases in all countries, but the decreasing trend was not further reduced in other countries except for China and Republic of Korea. The response of the daily increase rate to control measures was much earlier than the number of new cases. Conclusions: : Our results suggested that lockdown at the epicenter and social distancing effectively reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the early stage, but identification and isolation of patients, suspected cases and people with close contact at a community level is essential in further reduction of the daily increase rate of COVID-19.","output":"Modeling analysis reveals the transmission trend of COVID-19 and control efficiency of human intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity can modify cardiovascular parameters in response to nociceptive stimuli or drugs in anesthetized animals. The aim of this study was to determine if a surgical nociceptive stimulus and morphine, ketamine, and dobutamine administration would modify ANS activity observed as a change in the mean parasympathetic tone activity (PTAm) in anesthetized horses. In 20 anesthetized horses, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and PTAm were monitored before and 1, 3, and 5 min after surgical incision, and before and 10 min after the administration of morphine (0.2 mg/kg IV). If nystagmus or spontaneous ventilation was observed, ketamine (0.5 mg/kg IV) was given, and the three variables were registered before and 3 and 5 min afterward. If MAP reached 62 mmHg, a dobutamine infusion was administered, and the three variables were recorded before and 5 min after starting/increasing the infusion (0.25 g/kg/min IV every 5 min). The three variables were registered before and 1, 3, and 5 min after a PTAm decrease of 20%, HR increase of 10%, or MAP increase of 20%. The PTAm decreased 3 min after the administration of ketamine and 1 min after a PTA event. The surgical incision, dobutamine, and morphine did not modify PTAm. The absence of changes in ANS activity after the nociceptive stimulus and lack of correlation between PTAm and HR or MAP suggest that PTAm is a poor indicator of sympathetic activation under the study conditions.

We focused on: sociodemographic data, present use of digital technologies in daily life and for health reasons, patients eHealth literacy, and their overall attitude towards eHealth. A total of 234 patients completed the questionnaire. Most of the patients (90%) have a web-enabled computer, 78.2% have a smartphone, and 71.8% regularly search the internet for health-related information. Sixty-eight percent would like to receive discharge summaries online, and 54% would like to chat online with their physicians. Even though ICT use in daily life was age-related, no significant difference could be shown for health reasons or the type of transplanted organ. Modern ICT use is predominantly accepted for health reasons by SOT recipients. Regardless of the transplanted organ, a deeper integration of eHealth has potential for improving cross-sectoral care.

In this regard, it is expected that information level and sharing between equity, digital currency, and energy markets has been altered due to the pandemic outbreak. Specifically, the resulting twisted risk among markets is presumed to rise during the abnormal state of world economy. The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial perspective, we conclude that during the pandemic (i) portfolios composed of Bitcoin and Silver, Bitcoin and WTI, Bitcoin and Gold, Bitcoin and Brent, or Bitcoin and S&P500 could be risky, (ii) diversification opportunities exist by investing in portfolios composed of Gas and Silver, Gold and Silver, Gold and Gas, Brent and Silver, Brent and Gold, or Bitcoin and Gas, and that (iii) the VIX exhibited the lowest level of information disorder at all scales before and during the pandemic.

Hepatitis A and E are similar in causing only acute hepatitis, while some cases of hepatitis B and many of hepatitis C become chronic. The prevalence of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection has seen a reduction worldwide due to hepatitis B vaccination programs.

Yet global consumption of these products is rising due to profound changes in production, processing, manufacturing, marketing, retail, and consumption practices, alongside the growth of the resources and political influence of Big Food. Whilst the sales of UPFs and UPBs in high-income countries (HICs) are stagnating, sales are rapidly expanding in more populous middle-income countries (MICs). In this paper, we adopt a political economy of food systems approach to understand how growth of Big Food in MICs drives the NCD pandemic. METHODS We conducted a mixed methods synthesis review. This involved quantitative data collection and development of descriptive statistics; a search for academic, market and grey literature on the expansion of UPF in MICs; and the development of themes, three illustrative case examples (South Africa, Colombia, and Indonesia), and synthesis of the enablers of successful campaigns in MICs into recommendations for public health campaigns. RESULTS We project that the combined sales volume of UPFs in MICs will reach equivalency with HICs by 2024, and the total sales volume of UPBs in MICs is already significantly higher than in HICs. Similarly, annual growth in UPF sales is higher in MICs compared to HICs. We also show how Big Food has entrenched its presence within MICs through establishing global production and hyper-local distribution networks, scaling up its marketing, challenging government policies and scientific expertise, and co-opting civil society. We argue that public health can counter the influence of Big Food by developing an expanded global network of driven and passionate people with diverse skillsets, and advocating for increased government leadership. CONCLUSION The projected increase in sales of UPFs and UPBs in MICs raises major concerns about the global capacity to prevent and treat NCDs.","output":"Ultra-Processed Profits: The Political Economy of Countering the Global Spread of Ultra-Processed Foods - A Synthesis Review on the Market and Political Practices of Transnational Food Corporations and Strategic Public Health Responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the impact of COVID-19 on stress, and especially on financial stress, among Latino adults in California.

Recent observations reported poor outcomes of COVID-19 in pts with various cancer types and higher mortality rates compared with the general population. However, currently available data on COVID-19 in pts with hematologic disease are limited. Methods: CHRONOS19 registry is an observational prospective cohort study with the primary objective to evaluate the treatment outcomes in adult pts (age 18 or older) with hematologic disease and COVID-19. Secondary objectives are to describe severity and complications of COVID-19 and course of hematologic disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected pts, and to explore importance of various factors for disease severity and mortality. Pts with laboratory-confirmed or suspected (based on clinical symptoms and/or CT) COVID-19 were eligible for enrollment. Data were collected on a web platform and managed in a de-identified manner. Physicians from 8 hematology clinical centers and hospitals from all over Russia (Moscow, Ulan-Ude, Saransk, Vladimir, Nizhniy Novgorod, Kazan) participate in this study. Pts are followed for 30 days (ds) after COVID-19 diagnosis and up to 6 months (mos) for hematologic disease outcomes and overall survival assessment. The results of the first follow-up are presented in this interim analysis. Results: As of July 30, 2020, 184 pts were enrolled (females/males [n(%)]: 80(44%)/104 (56%); median [range] age: 55 [18-83] years.

Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 23% (41 pts died). Death due to COVID-19 complications occurred in 34 (83%) pts, 7(17%) pts died due to progression of hematologic disease. Fifty (28%) pts experienced COVID-19 complications, the most common were pneumonia in 125 (71%) pts, respiratory failure in 82(47%) pts, ARDS in 11(6%) pts, cytokine release syndrome in 15(9%) pts, multiple organ failure in 10(6%) pts, sepsis in 6(3%) pts, and pulmonary bleeding in 1(0,6%). Specific anti-COVID-19 treatment was given to 117 pts(67%) pts: most common first-line treatment was hydroxichloroquine+azithromycin in 84(72%) pts, azithromycin monotherapy in 27(23%) pts, other drugs in 6(5%) pts; second-line treatment comprised lopinavir+ritonavir in 38 pts, tocilizumab in 29 pts, umifenovir in 5 pts, baricitinib in 5 pts, canakinumab in 1pt, sarilumab in 1 pt. The rate of ICU admissions was 27%(47 pts), among them only 11(23%) pts survived, 36(20%) pts required mechanical ventilation, only 2(5.5%) pts survived. Eighty-eight(50%) pts received anticoagulants. With regard to the blood disease, treatment delays occurred in 101(57%) pts with a median 4 weeks, 6(3%) pts required change of treatment. At the first follow-up (30 ds) the rate of relapse / progression of hematologic disease was 16 of 151 evaluable pts (10.6%). Thirty-day overall survival was 75%. At the data cutoff, median overall survival was not reached. Antibody detection was performed in 70 pts: 53(76%) pts had IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among factors possibly associated with poor survival were: stage of COVID-19 1(n=41) - 91,8%/ 2(n=75) - 90%/ 3(n=36) - 56,5%/ 4(n=22) - 13,6% (p<0,0001), concomitant diseases (n=93/81): 59,5% vs. 87% (p=0,0001), transfusion dependence (n=65/104): 58,1% vs. 81,8% (p=0,0007), prior steroid therapy (n=73/90): 64,6% vs. 82% (p=0,019), older age (<60 (n=108)/60 (n=68) years): 80% vs. 60% (p=0,048). Sex, disease type, myelotoxic agranulocytosis, and prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were not associated with worse outcomes.

How people respond to information and regulations to control this infectious disease can be influenced by their age and generational identity. An individual with an optimal level of psychological flexibility can adapt to challenging situations more efficiently. Hence, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the moderating effect of generation on the relationship between psychological flexibility and COVID-19 preventive behaviour among different generational cohorts of women (baby boomers, X, Y, and Z). This relationship was rarely addressed in the literature, which is what inspired this study. Data were collected through an online survey. The responses of 834 Hungarian speaking women between the ages of 18 and 75 years old were successfully gathered. Four generational cohorts were represented in the sample population: baby boomers (age &gt; 56), X (age 41-55), Y (age 24-40), and Z (age 18-25). The moderation effect was calculated using the PROCESS macro in SPSS. A statistically significant moderation effect of generation was found on the relationship between psychological flexibility and COVID-19 prevention behaviour and the interaction added a small but significant contribution to the final model predicting preventive behaviour. In Generation Z, psychological flexibility predicted an increase in preventive behaviour, but no significant prediction was found among other generational cohorts. Females in their twenties seemed to be more engaged in COVID-19 prevention behaviour, if their psychological flexibility was higher, but failed to comply with health recommendations and safety protocols at low levels of flexibility. This study may provide a new perspective on how generational cohorts can influence the effect of psychological factors on COVID-19 preventive behaviour. Prevention of avoidance behaviours and facilitation of acceptance is definitory for psychologically flexible behaviours, while disease avoidance is crucial in prevention behaviour of COVID-19.

The genome sequence of COVID-19 opened the opportunity for multiple in vitro and clinical trials, but we still do not have a clear path to treatment. Chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM) is a safe and effective antihistamine with potent antiviral activity against various strains of influenza A/B, thus suggesting that CPM has broad antiviral activity. We tested the virucidal potential of CPM in a nasal spray composition currently in development as an anti-allergy medication. Methods The virucidal activity of CPM was tested using viral stock of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 strain in Vero 76 infected cells. The endpoint titer 50% cell culture infection dose (CCID(50)) values were calculated using the Reed-Muench (1948) equation. Three independent replicates of each sample were tested, and the average and standard deviation were calculated. Results were compared with untreated controls using one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with Dunnetts multiple comparison test in GraphPad Prism (version 8) software. Results After 25 minutes of contact time, the nasal spray reduced the levels of the virus from 4.2 to 1.7 log10 CCID(50) per 0.1 mL, a statistically significant 2.5 log reduction value or 99.7% reduction in the viral load. Conclusions This study demonstrates the strong virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2 of a nasal spray containing CPM. Given that CPM has broad antiviral effects against influenza and virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2, we propose two further studies: a randomized placebo-controlled study of intranasally delivered chlorpheniramine in patients with mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 and a second study aiming to determine the potential antiviral and adjuvant effects of CPM plus hydroxychloroquine, versus hydroxychloroquine alone, in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"In Vitro Virucidal Effect of Intranasally Delivered Chlorpheniramine Maleate Compound Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out first in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.

Previous epigenetic studies have indicated that alterations in host DNA methylation may modify the inflammatory response to bacterial infection. However, to date, genome-wide analysis of the DNA methylome during meningitis caused by G. parasuis infection is still lacking. In this study, we employed an unbiased approach using deep sequencing to profile the DNA methylome and transcriptome from G. parasuis infected porcine brain (cerebrum) and integrated the data to identify key differential methylation regions/sites involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Results showed that DNA methylation patterns and gene expression profiles from porcine brain were changed after G. parasuis infection. The majority of the altered DNA methylation regions were found in the intergenic regions and introns and not associated with CpG islands, with only a low percentage occurring at promoter or exon regions. Integrated analysis of the DNA methylome and transcriptome identified a number of inversely and positively correlated genes between DNA methylation and gene expression, following the criteria of |log(2)FC| > 0.5, |diffMethy| > 0.1, and P < 0.05. Differential expression and methylation of two significant genes, semaphoring 4D (SEMA4D) and von Willebrand factor A domain containing 1 (VWA1), were validated by qRT-PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses demonstrated that DNA methylation inversely correlated genes in G. parasuis infected porcine brains were mainly involved with cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, RIG-1-like receptor signaling pathways, and hematopoietic cell lineage signaling pathways. In addition, a protein-protein interaction network of differentially methylated genes found potential candidate molecular interactions relevant to the pathology of G. parasuis infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate the DNA methylome and transcriptome data from G. parasuis infected porcine brains. Our findings will help understanding the contribution of genome-wide DNA methylation to the pathogenesis of meningitis in pigs and developing epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of G. parasuis induced meningitis.","output":"Methylome and Transcriptome-Based Integration Analysis Identified Molecular Signatures Associated With Meningitis Induced by Glaesserella parasuis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P179 Table 1RHCU Data Job role (%) - Senior doctor (registrar and above) - Junior doctor - Senior nurse (band 6 and above) - Staff nurse - HCA - Physio - Other (pharmacist, ward clerk, housekeepers, students) 8 9 11 25 17 11 19 Time worked on RHCU (%): - 1C4 months - 4C8 months - 8C12 months 25 13 62 Age of participants in years (%): - 18-25 - 26-35 - 36-45 - 46-55 - 56-65 - >65 13.2 34.0 24.5 18.9 7.5 1.9 Analysis April 2020 March 2021 Overall MHR (%): - Poor - Fairly poor - Average - Fairly good - Excellent 4 10 25 44 17 11 19 26 42 2 Mood symptoms C reported as half the time or more (%) - Depressed - Tearful - Anxious - Irritable 4 6 18 18 21 27 44 40 Anxiety coming into work experienced half the time or more (%) 14 45 Lack of motivation at work experienced half the time or more (%) 10 30 Work-life balance C reported as half the time or more (%) - Worrying/thinking about patients outside of normal working hours - Trouble falling asleep or sleeping too much - Feeling overly tired after a shift - Difficulty focusing on activities outside of work - Strain on personal relationships - Over/under eating - Exercising regularly 24 33 35 20 24 29 52 58 55 51 43 42 54 50 Further analysis Impact on physical health (%) - No impact - Unsure - Little impact - Significant impact 10 15 49 26 Would you continue in your current job role?

We aimed to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in universities/colleges in Seoul Metropolitan Area during COVID-19 pandemic period. METHODS: Among the 38 universities in Seoul, 23 have agreed to participate in the study. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified from individual-level case reports submitted to the universities and to the health authorities from February 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Through the linkage with the Central Disease Control Headquarters' database, number of secondary infected cases (both within and outside of the campus) were counted. RESULTS: Between February 2020 and June 2021, a total of 827 COVID-19 cases were confirmed and reported in the universities across Seoul Metropolitan City. Generally, the community-associated cases had peaks preceding the university/college-associated. Of those with the documented clinical parameters, 38.6% of the cases were asymptomatic. Among them, 93% were potentially exposed off-campus, and 87.7% of the cases had not produced the secondary infection cases. CONCLUSION: In the setting of rigorous infection prevention measures in combination with on- and off- hybrid classes, COVID-19 incidences and outbreaks were limited in university and college campus area across Seoul Metropolitan Area.

ECGs beat morphologies, beat durations, and amplitudes vary from subject to subject and diseases to diseases. Therefore, ECG morphology-based modeling has long-standing research interests. This work aims to develop a simplified ECG model based on a minimum number of parameters that could correctly represent ECG morphology in different cardiac dysrhythmias. A simple mathematical model based on the sum of two Gaussian functions is proposed. However, fitting more than one Gaussian function in a deterministic way has accuracy and localization problems. To solve these fitting problems, two hybrid optimization methods have been developed to select the optimal ECG model parameters. The first method is the combination of an approximation and global search technique (ApproxiGlo), and the second method is the combination of an approximation and multi-start search technique (ApproxiMul). The proposed model and optimization methods have been applied to real ECGs in different cardiac dysrhythmias, and the effectiveness of the model performance was measured in time, frequency, and the time-frequency domain. The model fit different types of ECG beats representing different cardiac dysrhythmias with high correlation coefficients (>0.98). Compared to the nonlinear fitting method, ApproxiGlo and ApproxiMul are 3.32 and 7.88 times better in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), respectively. Regarding optimization, the ApproxiMul performs better than the ApproxiGlo method in many metrics. Different uses of this model are possible, such as a syntactic ECG generator using a graphical user interface has been developed and tested. In addition, the model can be used as a lossy compression with a variable compression rate. A compression ratio of 20:1 can be achieved with 1 kHz sampling frequency and 75 beats per minute. These optimization methods can be used in different engineering fields where the sum of Gaussians is used.","output":"Design and Optimization of ECG Modeling for Generating Different Cardiac Dysrhythmias"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herbicides are widely applied in agriculture, which causes emerging concern for contaminating surface water and groundwater. The degradation of isoproturon, being a typical phenylurea herbicide, has been studied much with advanced oxidation processes.

In the present work, the degradation mechanisms of OH-initiated reactions of isoproturon were studied at the MPWB1K/6-311+G(3df, 2p)//MPWB1K/6-31+G(d, p) level. The calculation results display that H-atom abstraction, OH addition, and OH substitution pathways are found for OH and isoproturon reactions. For H-atom abstractions, the results show that aliphatic H atoms are more easily abstracted by OH than the aromatic H atoms, and the pathway R6 has the lowest energy barrier of 6.65 kcal mol-1, indicating that H in the -CH3 group attached to the N2 atom could be most favorably abstracted. Six pathways for OH addition to the six sites of the phenyl ring are identified with low energy barriers, which are in good accordance with the fact that the additions of OH to the phenyl ring were the important steps from experimental results. For OH substitution reactions, two pathways with high activation energies are found, and the corresponding products have been also detected from previous experimental studies, suggesting that the substitution reactions could also occur.","output":"The theoretical investigation of OH-induced degradation mechanisms of isoproturon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The problem of respiratory sound classification has received good attention from the clinical scientists and medical researchers community in the last year to the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease.

As case numbers started to rise, what ensued was government-led interventions similar to those instituted across the world in the form of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, curfews, restrictions on mass gatherings and other physical distancing measures. These measures negatively affected blood donor mobilisation activities. Nigeria, like many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa prior to COVID-19 had encountered challenges with recruiting sufficient voluntary blood donors to meet the huge blood needs in the country, and so dire consequences of these infection prevention measures on national blood supplies were anticipated. A noticeable decline in blood donations and available safely screened blood for transfusions thus followed. We aimed to assess the blood service activities across seventeen (17) National Blood Transfusion Service centres in Nigeria, including numbers of blood donations, mobile blood drives, blood units screened, outcomes of screening, number of hospitals the NBTS provided services to and number of blood units discarded over the study period. Method: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood services in seventeen (17) NBTS centres in Nigeria, comparing the months of January to December 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to the months of January to December 2020 (peri-COVID-19).

Although both national and international guidelines value reproductive counseling as an essential aspect of the diagnostic-therapeutic pathway, part and parcel of the informed consent process, it is not included within the protocols adopted by the operating units for the care and management of neoplastic diseases. Objective. This study aimed to evaluate the activity of the Breast Unit of the Policlinico Umberto I Hospital, Rome, Italy, and the degree of compliance with guidelines. By knowing the strengths and weaknesses of such approaches, the standards of care offered to breast cancer patients can be improved. Materials and methods. A retrospective study based on a review of medical records was conducted between 2014 and 2021. Patients under 40 years of age diagnosed with non-metastatic malignancies were included who received chemotherapy treatment, namely neoadjuvant, adjuvant or adjuvant hormone therapy. Results. The data were extracted from the medical records of 51 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 41% of whom received reproductive counseling, and of these, 43% decided to undertake a path of fertility preservation. Factors such as the absence of children and young age reportedly favored both the interest in counseling proposals by the medical staff and the decision to undertake a path of fertility preservation. Conclusions. The study shows that there has been growing interest in the topic of oncofertility, especially in light of law 219/2017. Therefore, since 2018, multiple proposals for reproductive counseling have been set forth, but there was not an equally growing demand for fertility preservation practices, which can be explained by the invasive nature of such practices, the patients concern about their own state of health, and poor or inadequate information. Such impediments highlight the importance of standardized counseling and the need for a multidisciplinary medical team to support the patient in the decision-making process. The study also revealed a drop in the number of patients receiving counseling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, contrary to the positive trend that was recorded prior to the pandemic.","output":"Oncofertility and Reproductive Counseling in Patients with Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aims were to explore the effect of head-up tilt (HUT) to 30 and 60 degrees on hemodynamics and tissue oxygenation in anesthetized healthy swine. The data serve as a reference for a study of resuscitation efficacy at HUT such as during transport. Nine healthy swine (49+/-4 kg) were anesthetized and multiple sensors including myocardial pressure-volume loops catheter, carotid flow probe, blood pressure catheters, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) tissue oximetry and mixed venous oximetry (SVO2) catheter were introduced and parameters continuously recorded. Experimental protocol consisted of baseline in supine position (15 min), 30 degrees HUT (15 min), recovery at supine position (15 min) and 60 degrees HUT (5 min). Vacuum mattress was used for body fixation during tilts. We found that 30 and 60 degrees inclination led to significant immediate reduction in hemodynamic and oximetry parameters. Mean arterial pressure (mm Hg) decreased from 98 at baseline to 53 and 39, respectively. Carotid blood flow dropped to 47 % and 22 % of baseline values, end diastolic volume to 49 % and 53 % and stroke volume to 47 % and 45 % of baseline. SVO2 and tissue oximetry decreased by 17 and 21 percentage points. The values are means. In conclusions, within minutes, both 30 and 60 degrees head-up tilting is poorly tolerated in anesthetized swine.

Using a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that models linear elasticity we compute displacements and stresses in a two-dimensional cross section of the diaphragm in its contracted state. The boundary data consists of a mix of displacement and traction conditions. If these are imposed as they are, and the conditions are not compatible, this leads to reduced smoothness of the solution. Therefore, the boundary data is first smoothed using the least-squares radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) framework. Then the boundary conditions are reformulated as a Robin boundary condition with smooth coefficients. The same framework is also used to approximate the boundary curve of the diaphragm cross section based on data obtained from a slice of a computed tomography (CT) scan. To solve the PDE we employ the unfitted least-squares RBF-FD method. This makes it easier to handle the geometry of the diaphragm, which is thin and non-convex. We show numerically that our solution converges with high-order towards a finite element solution evaluated on a fine grid. Through this simplified numerical model we also gain an insight into the challenges associated with the diaphragm geometry and the boundary conditions before approaching a more complex three-dimensional model.","output":"An unfitted radial basis function generated finite difference method applied to thoracic diaphragm simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research, we will present the results of the Covid-19 case data in January 2021 on the Prizren region.

In this study, we analyzed the epidemiological and genetic features of NoV outbreaks from July 2014 to June 2018 in Huzhou, China. A total of 450 stool samples collected from 51 AGE outbreaks were tested for NoVs by real-time RT PCR. Partial polymerase and capsid sequences of NoV-positive samples were amplified and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. NoVs were found to be responsible of 84.3% of AGE outbreaks in Huzhou over the past 5 years. Most NoV outbreaks were reported in the cool months (November-March) and occurred in primary schools and kindergartens. Changes in the diversity of genotypes and the distribution of predominant types were observed in recent years. At least eight genotypes were identified, and 91.9% of the genotyped outbreaks were caused by non-GII.4 strains. The top three circulating genotypes during the study period were GII.2[P16], GII.3[P12], and GII.17[P17]. The predominant NoV genotypes in outbreaks have changed from GII.4 variants to GII.17[P17] in 2014-2015, GII.3[P12] in 2015-2016, and then GII.2[P16] in 2016-2018.

General practitioners often overestimate patient expectations for an antibiotic. In this study, we describe how general practitioners and patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI) communicate about their problem, including the reason for encounter and ideas, concerns, and expectations (ICE), and how this relates to (non-)antibiotic prescribing in out-of-hours (OOH) primary care. Methods: A qualitative descriptive framework analysis of video-recorded consultations during OOH primary care focusing on doctor-patient communication. Results: We analyzed 77 videos from 19 general practitioners. General practitioners using patient-centered communication skills received more information on the perspective of the patients on the illness period. For some patients, the reason for the encounter was motivated by their belief that a general practitioner (GP) visit will alter the course of their illness. The ideas, concerns, and expectations often remained implicit, but the concerns were expressed by the choice of words, tone of voice, repetition of words, etc. Delayed prescribing was sometimes used to respond to implicit patient expectations for an antibiotic. Patients accepted a non-antibiotic management plan well. Conclusion: Not addressing the ICE of patients, or their reason to consult the GP OOH, could drive assumptions about patient expectations for antibiotics early on and antibiotic prescribing later in the consultation.","output":"Antibiotic Prescribing and Doctor-Patient Communication During Consultations for Respiratory Tract Infections: A Video Observation Study in Out-of-Hours Primary Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic during the fall of 2019 and into the spring of 2020 has led to an increased demand of disposable N95 respirators and other types of personal protective equipment (PPE) as a way to prevent virus spread and help ensure the safety of healthcare workers. The sudden demand led to rapid modification, development, and dissemination of 3D printed PPE. The goal of this study was to determine the inherent sterility and re-sterilizing ability of 3D printed PPE in order to provide sterile equipment to the healthcare field and the general public. METHODS: Samples of polylactic acid (PLA), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) (infill-based designs) and polypropylene (single-wall hollow design) were 3D printed. Samples were inoculated with E. coli for 24 h and then sanitized using various chemical solutions or heat-based methods. The samples were then incubated for 24- or 72-h in sterile LB medium at 37C, and bacterial growth was measured by optical density at 600nm. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism v8.2.1. RESULTS: Significant bacterial growth was observed in all PLA and TPU based samples following re-sterilization, regardless of the methods used when compared to controls (p < 0.05). The single-walled hollow polypropylene design was not only sterile following printing, but was also able to undergo re-sanitization following bacterial inoculation, with no significant bacterial growth (p > 0.05) observed regardless of sanitization method used. CONCLUSION: The cost effectiveness, ease of sanitization, and reusability of 3D printed PPE, using our novel single-walled polypropylene design can help meet increased demands of PPE for healthcare workers and the general public that are needed to help decrease the viral transmission of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 3D printing also has the potential to lead to the creation and production of other sterile material items for the healthcare industry in the future. The ability to re-sterilize 3D printed PPE, as our design shows, would also contribute less to the increase in biomedical waste (BMW) being experienced by COVID-19.","output":"Sterilization and sanitizing of 3D-printed personal protective equipment using polypropylene and a Single Wall design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the experience of small business operators in South-Eastern Nigeria to underscore the sub-sectoral effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures on small businesses. Although COVID-19 lockdown and social distancing policies are generally perceived to have negative effects on small businesses, this study argues that these policies have had both positive and negative effects on small businesses. Clustering small businesses into three categories: fashion/event, food/drug and general merchandise, the study depicts a cross-sectoral disparity in the patronage level and income streams of small businesses. While the fashion/event businesses experience very low sales and poor performances, the food/drug businesses record high sales/improved performances, and the general merchandise maintains normal sales/performances. The study observes gaps in governments COVID-19 intervention policies and initiatives (palliatives) on small businesses and proposes new policy directions to cushion the negative impact of lockdown measures and fast track the sustainability of small businesses in post-COVID-19 period.

(1) What is the average effect of the orders on the percentage of residents staying at home? (2) Is the effect heterogeneous across counties with different percentages of vulnerable populations (defined as those without health insurance or who did not attend high school)? (3) If so, why are the orders less effective for some counties than for others? Academic/practical relevance: To combat the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a number of states in the United States implemented stay-at-home orders that prevent residents from leaving their homes except for essential trips. These orders have drawn heavy criticism from the public because whether they are necessary and effective in increasing the number of residents staying at home is unclear. Methodology: We estimate the average effect of the orders using a difference-in-differences model, where the control group is the counties that did not implement the orders and the treatment group is the counties that did implement the orders during our study period. We estimate the heterogeneous effects of the orders by interacting county features with treatment dummies in a triple-difference model. Results: Using a unique set of mobile device data that track residents' mobility, we find that, although some residents already voluntarily stayed at home before the implementation of any order, the stay-at-home orders increased the number of residents staying at home by 2.832 percentage points (or 11.25%). We also find that these orders are less effective for counties with higher percentages of uninsured or less educated (i.e., did not attend high school) residents. To explore the mechanisms behind these results, we analyze the effect of the orders on the average number of work and nonwork trips per person. We find that the orders reduce the number of work trips by 0.053 (or 7.87%) and nonwork trips by 0.183 (or 6.50%). The percentage of uninsured or less educated residents in a county negatively correlates with the reduction in the number of work trips but does not correlate with the reduction in the number of nonwork trips. Managerial implications: Our results suggest that uninsured and less educated residents are less likely to follow the orders because their jobs prevent them from working from home. Policy makers must take into account the differences in residents' socioeconomic status when developing new policies or allocating limited healthcare resources.","output":"Using Mobile Device Data to Understand the Effect of Stay-at-Home Orders on Residents' Mobility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The real-time PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is used to perform collection of biological fluid condensed in a refrigerated device from deep airways' exhaled air. We aimed to verify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the EBC from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, and to determine if the EBC may represent a valid alternative to the NPS. METHODS Seventeen consecutive patients admitted to the Emergency Department of the Policlinico were enrolled in the present study with RT-PCR, clinical and radiological evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Within 24 hours from the NPS collection the EBC collection was performed on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Informed written consent was gathered and the Ethic Committee approved the study. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 60 years (24-92) and 64.7% (11/17) were male. Patient n. 9 and n.17 died. All NPS resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 at RT-PCR. RT-PCR on EBC resulted negative for all but one patients (patient n.12). CONCLUSION In this study we did not find any correlation between positive NPS and the EBC in all but one patients enrolled. Based on these data which greatly differ from previous reports on the topic, this study opens several questions related to small differences in the complex process of EBC collection and how EBC could be really standardized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of presenting complaints and PCR tests collected during the COVID-19 epidemic from 4 EDs from a large hospital system in Bronx County, NY, from May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) were calculated for a symptom screen based on the CDC list of COVID-19 symptoms: fever/chills, shortness of breath/dyspnea, cough, muscle or body ache, fatigue, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, nasal congestion/runny nose, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. PPV was calculated for varying values of prevalence. RESULTS: There were 80,078 visits with PCR tests. The sensitivity of the symptom screen was 64.7% (95% CI: 63.6, 65.8), specificity 65.4% (65.1, 65.8). PPV was 16.8% (16.5, 17.0) and NPV was 94.5% (94.4, 94.7) when the observed prevalence of COVID-19 in the ED over the year was 9.7%. The PPV of fever/chills, cough, body and muscle aches and nasal congestion/runny nose were each approximately 25% across the year, while diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and headache were less predictive, (PPV 4.7%C9.6%) The combinations of fever/chills, cough, muscle/body aches, and shortness of breath had PPVs of 40C50%. The PPV of the screen varied from 3.7% (3.6, 3.8) at 2% prevalence of COVID-19 to 44.3% (44.0, 44.7) at 30% prevalence. CONCLUSION: The proportion of patients with a chief complaint of COVID-19 symptoms and confirmed COVID-19 infection was exceeded by the proportion without actual infection. This was true when prevalence in the ED was as high as 30%. Cohorting of patients based on the CDC's list of COVID-19 symptoms will expose many patients who do not have COVID-19 to risk of nosocomially acquired COVID-19. EDs should not use the CDC list of COVID-19 symptoms as the only strategy to minimize exposure.","output":"Should COVID-19 symptoms be used to cohort patients in the emergency department?

This study investigates how the optokinetic response differs between levels of visual attention in healthy adults while controlling for alertness. METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects (8 men and 4 women; mean age = 33  9.36) with intact gaze-stability, visual acuity, and binocularity were recruited. Subjects viewed a rotating visual scene provoking torsional optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) while wearing a video eye tracker in a seated head-fixed position. Tasks requiring focused, neutral, and divided visual attention were issued to each subject and the OKN was recorded. Pupil sizes were monitored as a proxy for alertness. RESULTS: Pupil dilation was increased for both focused and divided visual attention. The number of nystagmus beats was highest for the focused condition and lowest for the divided attentional task. OKN gain was increased during both focused and divided attention. The distribution of nystagmus beats over time showed that only focused attention produced a reliable adaptation of the OKN. CONCLUSIONS: Results consequently indicate that OKN frequency is adaptive to a viewer's level of visual attention, whereas OKN gain is influenced by alertness levels. This pattern offers insight into the neural processes integrating visual input with reflexive motor responses. For example, it contextualizes why attention to visual stimuli can cause dizziness, as the OKN frequency reflects activity of the velocity storage mechanism. Additionally, the OKN could offer a possible venue for differentiating between visual attention and alertness during psychometric testing.","output":"Alertness and Visual Attention Impact Different Aspects of the Optokinetic Reflex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) senses cytosolic DNA and catalyzes the formation of 2'3'-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which in turn triggers interferon (IFN) production. Inappropriate activation of cGAS and production of cGAMP have been linked to a diversity of autoimmune diseases. The volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) have been recently demonstrated to permeate cGAMP, thus making the channel essential for the activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING axis. DCPIB, a prominent inhibitor of VRAC channel, has been recently reported to also significantly activate TREK1 channel. Herein, in this study, we have designed and synthesized a series of novel DCPIB derivatives and investigated their potential regulatory effects on VRAC/TREK1 channels. Our results manifested that compound 6u was a dual inhibitor of VRAC/TREK1 channels with IC50s of 7.11  0.94 M and 4.43  0.90 M, respectively. On top of that, our data demonstrated that 6u impaired interferon production in a concentration-dependently manner by dampening cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway without any cytotoxicity when it comes to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection. To sum up, our study not only discovered a novel DCPIB analog with dual inhibitory effects on VRAC/TREK1 channels but also provided a new strategy for the design and development of newly potent VRAC inhibitors, which benefits the treatment of cGAS-STING related autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.","output":"Novel DCPIB analogs as dual inhibitors of VRAC/TREK1 channels reduced cGAS-STING mediated interferon responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Besides antigen-specific responses to viral antigens, humoral immune response in virus infection can generate polyreactive and autoreactive antibodies.

In these cases pharmacological prophylaxis would be a solution to reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) transmission. Hydroxychloroquine has in vitro antiviral properties against SARS CoV-2. We therefore sought to determine the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis for COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We electronically searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane COVID-19 Register of Controlled Trials, Epistemonikos COVID-19, clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to September 28(th), 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effect model. We identified four RCTs (n = 4921) that met our eligibility criteria. The use of hydroxychloroquine, compared to placebo, did not reduce the risks of developing COVID-19 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.04, moderate certainty), hospitalization (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.50, moderate certainty), or mortality (RR 3.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 79.74, low certainty), however, hydroxychloroquine use increased the risk of adverse events (RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.38 to 5.55, moderate certainty). CONCLUSION: Although pharmacologic prophylaxis is an attractive preventive strategy against COVID-19, the current body of evidence failed to show clinical benefit for prophylactic hydroxychloroquine and showed a higher risk of adverse events when compared to placebo or no prophylaxis.","output":"The efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 prophylaxis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sam Foster, Chief Nurse, Oxford University Hospitals, considers the range of issues that needs to be considered to enable retired nurses and those redeployed from other areas to care for patients with COVID-19.","output":"Ensuring safe practice during the pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The glycocalyx is a ubiquitous structure found on endothelial cells that extends into the vascular lumen.

Last, we explore clinically relevant non-modifiable and modifiable factors that exacerbate or protect against endothelial glycocalyx shedding during sepsis.","output":"Endothelial glycocalyx degradation during sepsis: Causes and consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The current Covid-19 outbreak becomes a tremendous public health concern worldwide. Since a little information is available on nutritional status and its devastating effects on covid-19 complications in Iran, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate nutritional status of covid-19 population and its related factors. METHODS: We performed this observational study by recruiting 400 hospitalized covid-19 subjects. Thereafter, the needed clinical and para clinical data were collected and their nutritional status was then assessed using NRS-2002. RESULTS: Approximately 36% of the total sample size and 100% of the ICU- admitted cases were at the severe risk of malnutrition. The patients with NRS 5 were significantly older (p < 0.0001). Non-survivals obtained higher scores in terms of both severity of disease (86%) and impaired nutritional status (67%), and this relationship was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.0001). In regard to the obtained prognostic inflammatory scores, 86% of the non-survivals obtained significantly highest scores for GPS (P = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Nutritional status has a considerable effect on clinical outcomes of covid-19 patients, which should be evaluated. Thereafter, rapid subsequent nutritional interventions must be implemented in this regard. As well, special attention must be paid to both elderly population and individuals with underlying diseases.","output":"The importance of nutritional status on clinical outcomes among both ICU and Non-ICU patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 among the population has occurred quite recently, there is a lack of evidence on the long-term duration of antibody response, especially in children. It is therefore crucial to clarify this aspect, considering its implications in the development of successful surveillance strategies, therapies, and vaccinations. The aim of this study was to assess the antibody response in a children group after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to compare it with that of their parents affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We enrolled 12 children and their parents, both groups being affected by COVID-19 in April 2020. In the childrens group, we collected real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values and gene characterization of first nasal-throat swab at the time of diagnosis (T0); 30 days after the diagnosis (T30), we performed blood tests to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. Finally, 180 days after the diagnosis (T180), we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in both children and parents. In children, antibody levels declined significantly at 180 days (T180) after first measurement (T30). There were no significant differences in IgG level related to age, sex, and clinical manifestations. We found a significant correlation between IgG titers at T30 and Ct value of gene N. Children showed a lower level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at T180 compared to their parents. Conclusion: Antibody responses in children waned 180 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and at the same time, their parents showed a different antibody response to the virus. These results highlight that serological tests should be used with caution in surveillance strategies among the general population.","output":"Serum IgG levels in children 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and comparison with adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the following paper, I present through four practical examples how the development of mobile applications changed during the COVID-19 pandemic 2020 springtime To what extent was the work of designers-developers determined by the quarantine, and by the possible time constraints? Which part of their work did they reduce most, and what could go on unchanged? The BPXV app was developed at the request of the 15th district of Budapest to help the district residents to shop and get their medicines during the confinement A refreshing exception among the examples is the app created to replace Easter watering, Locsolkodj hu I also present two solutions suitable for contact tracking, the Virus Radar created in Macedonia, which became the official Hungarian contact tracking app, and the Austrian STOPP CORONA interface/platform? In order to find out the answers to the above questions, I conducted written and telephone interviews with the owners, designers, developers, or researchers of each site Learning about design and development, I was interested in how the development of these apps, designed and developed at the time of the confinement, differed from the usual process - what the designers reduced, where were the, , cuts' made Based on the experience with the small sample, I found that the possibilities were typically limited in the user needs assessment and testing, but the Austrian example is a refreshing exception: it was tested by different methods, with the participation of the greatest number of real users (and not official employees or internal team members) It is a general experience that in the case of researched and introduced apps and websites designed and developed during a pandemic typically decreased the amount of classic user and usability tests It is also characteristic that to the west of Hungary, the apps are tested by users, to the east by offices / officials / developers ? 2020 IEEE","output":"How were apps developed during, and for, COVID-19? : AAn investigation into user needs assessment and testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To describe the incidence and patterns of the spinal injuries in the victims of physical IPV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board (IRB) approval, we retrospectively reviewed patients referred to our institutions domestic violence intervention and prevention program with a diagnosis directly related to physical abuse between January 2013 and June 2018. Electronic health records and radiology reports were reviewed for all patients. RESULTS: A total of 21/688 (3%) IPV patients with 41 vertebral injuries were identified. The study population comprised of 19/21 (90%) females. Median age of the included patients was 43 years with a range of 21C72 years. All vertebral injuries were AO type A spinal injuries. Upper lumbar spine (L1 and L2) was the most common level of injury followed by upper to mid-thoracic spine. The reported mechanism of the injury was IPV in 8/21 (38.0%), fall in 8/21(38.0%), and incidental in 5/21 (24.0%). Ten out of 21 (48%) patients had concomitant injuries, most commonly to the craniofacial region 5/21 (23%). Psychiatry history was positive in 17/21 (81%), and substance abuse was positive in 15/21 (71%) of the patients. CONCLUSION: Incidence of spinal injuries is relatively low in IPV with morphologic AO type A injury being the most common type of injury and the upper lumbar spine being the most common level of injury.","output":"Incidence and characteristics of spinal injuries in the victims of intimate partner violence (IPV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can induce excitability changes of a stimulated brain area through synaptic plasticity mechanisms. High-frequency (100 Hz) triplets of rTMS synchronized to the negative but not the positive peak of the ongoing sensorimotor -rhythm isolated with the concurrently acquired electroencephalography (EEG) resulted in a reproducible long-term potentiation like increase of motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, an index of corticospinal excitability (Zrenner et al. 2018, Brain Stimul 11:374-389). Here, we analyzed the EEG and TMS-EEG data from (Zrenner et al., 2018) to investigate the effects of -rhythm-phase-dependent burst-rTMS on EEG-based measures of cortical excitability. We used resting-state EEG to assess - and -power in the motor cortex ipsi- and contralateral to the stimulation, and single-pulse TMS-evoked and induced EEG responses in the stimulated motor cortex. We found that -rhythm-phase-dependent burst-rTMS did not significantly change any of these EEG measures, despite the presence of a significant differential and reproducible effect on MEP amplitude. We conclude that EEG measures of cortical excitability do not reflect corticospinal excitability as measured by MEP amplitude. Most likely this is explained by the fact that rTMS induces complex changes at the molecular and synaptic level towards both excitation and inhibition that cannot be differentiated at the macroscopic level by EEG.","output":"Nil effects of -rhythm phase-dependent burst-rTMS on cortical excitability in humans: A resting-state EEG and TMS-EEG study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombus is considered to be the pathological source of morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease and thrombotic complications, while oxidative stress is regarded as an important factor in vascular endothelial injury and thrombus formation. Therefore, antioxidative stress and maintaining the normal function of vascular endothelial cells are greatly significant in regulating vascular tension and maintaining a nonthrombotic environment. Leonurine (LEO) is a unique alkaloid isolated from Leonurus japonicus Houtt (a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)), which has shown a good effect on promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. In this study, we explored the protective effect and action mechanism of LEO on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after damage by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). The protective effects of LEO on H(2)O(2)-induced HUVECs were determined by measuring the cell viability, cell migration, tube formation, and oxidative biomarkers. The underlying mechanism of antioxidation of LEO was investigated by RT-qPCR and western blotting. Our results showed that LEO treatment promoted cell viability; remarkably downregulated the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); and upregulated the nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in H(2)O(2)-induced HUVECs. At the same time, LEO treatment significantly promoted the phosphorylation level of angiogenic protein PI3K, Akt, and eNOS and the expression level of survival factor Bcl2 and decreased the expression level of death factor Bax and caspase3. In conclusion, our findings suggested that LEO can ameliorate the oxidative stress damage and insufficient angiogenesis of HUVECs induced by H(2)O(2) through activating the PI3K/Akt-eNOS signaling pathway.","output":"Leonurine Ameliorates Oxidative Stress and Insufficient Angiogenesis by Regulating the PI3K/Akt-eNOS Signaling Pathway in H(2)O(2)-Induced HUVECs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract With the frequent occurrence of irregular events in recent years, the tourism industry in some areas, such as Hong Kong, has suffered great volatility. To enhance the predictive accuracy of tourism demand forecasting, a decomposition-ensemble approach is developed based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, data characteristic analysis, and the Elman's neural network model. Using Hong Kong tourism demand as an empirical case, this study firstly investigates how data characteristic analysis is used in a decomposition-ensemble approach. The empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms other models in both point and interval forecasts for different prediction horizons, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for forecasting tourism demand, especially for time series with complexity.","output":"A decomposition-ensemble approach for tourism forecasting"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/45.md","filePath":"consultation/45.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/45.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
