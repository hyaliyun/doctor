METHODS: Retrospective analysis of surgical procedures carried out at 39 Academic hospitals. A distinction was made between elective and urgent procedures. Intravitreal injections were also considered. Percentages for all surgical procedures and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) events were calculated. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 20,886 versus 55,259 and 56,640 patients underwent surgery during the lockdown versus intra-and inter-year control periods, respectively. During the lockdown, only 70% of patients for whom an operation/intravitreal injection was recommended, finally underwent surgery; the remaining patients did not attend because afraid of getting infected at the hospital (23%), taking public transportation (6.5%), or unavailable swabs (0.5%). Elective surgeries were reduced by 96.2% and 96.4%, urgent surgeries by 49.7% and 50.2%, and intravitreal injections by 48.5% and 48.6% in the lockdown period in comparison to intra-year and inter-year control periods, respectively. IRRs for RRDs during lockdown dropped significantly in comparison with intra- and inter-year control periods (CI: 0.65-0.80 and 0.61-0.75, respectively, p < 0.001 for both).

Aging is associated with a decline in immune function and chronic activation of inflammation that contributes to enhanced viral susceptibility and reduced responses to vaccination. Here we briefly review the pathogenicity of the virus, epidemiology and clinical response, and the underlying mechanisms of human aging in improving vaccination. We review current methods to improve vaccination in the older adults using novel vaccine platforms and adjuvant systems.

As the world seeks solutions to such pathogens, global and regional surveillance is required. The aim of the present study was to examine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and clonal relatedness of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected for a period of three years through pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Isolate IDs, antimicrobial assays, ESBL-production, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were examined with the Vitek 2 Compact Automated System. IDs were confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, with the resulting sequences being deposited in NCBI databases. DNA was extracted and resistance genes were detected by PCR amplification with appropriate primers. Isolates were extensive (31%) and multidrug-resistant (65%). Pulsotype clusters grouped the isolates into 22 band profiles that showed no specific pattern with phenotypes. Of the isolates, 98% were ESBL-KP, 69% were carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) strains, and 72.5% comprised the carriage of two MBLs (SIM and IMP). Integrons (ISAba1, ISAba2, and IS18) were detected in 69% of the MDR-KP. Additionally, OXA-23 was detected in 67% of the isolates. This study therefore demonstrates clonal diversity among clinical K. pneumoniae, confirming that this bacterium has access to an enormous pool of genes that confer high resistance-developing potential.","output":"Genetic Analysis, Population Structure, and Characterisation of Multidrug-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae from the Al-Hofuf Region of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals with substance use disorders exhibit risk-taking behaviors, potentially leading to negative consequences and difficulty maintaining recovery. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have yielded mixed effects on risk-taking among healthy controls. Given the importance of risk-taking behaviors among substance-using samples, this study aimed to examine the effects of tDCS on risk-taking among a sample of adults using cannabis. Using a double-blind design, 27 cannabis users [M(SD) age = 32.48 (1.99), 41% female] were randomized, receiving one session of active or sham tDCS over the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Stimulation parameters closely followed prior studies with anodal right dlPFC and cathodal left dlPFC stimulation. Risk-takingassessed via a modified Cambridge Gambling Taskwas measured before and during tDCS. Delay and probability discounting tasks were assessed before and after stimulation. No significant effects of stimulation on risk-taking behavior were found. However, participants chose the less risky option 86% of the trials before stimulation which potentially contributed to ceiling effects. These results contradict one prior study showing increased risk-taking among cannabis users following tDCS. There was a significant increase in delay discounting of a $1000 delayed reward during stimulation for the sham group only, but no significant effects for probability discounting. The current study adds to conflicting and inconclusive literature on tDCS and cognition among substance-using samples. In conclusion, results suggest the ineffectiveness of single session dlPFC tDCS using an established stimulation protocol on risk-taking, although ceiling effects at baseline may have also prevented behavior change following tDCS.","output":"The Effects of a Single Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Session on Impulsivity and Risk Among a Sample of Adult Recreational Cannabis Users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPACT: The Wake Forest School of Medicine Mentor Academy has adapted to provide continued effective and relevant formal mentoring training to translational researchers in a virtual format, to improve mentoring and provide effective mentor-mentee communication tools. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: To determine whether the WFSM Mentor Academy (MA), an effective long-standing mentoring program for research faculty, is compromised after moving from an in-person to an online format as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A vetted National Research Mentoring Network (NMRN) implemented at WFSM addresses 6 major competencies (Effective Communication, Aligning Expectations, Assessing Understanding, Addressing Equity/Inclusion, Fostering Independence, Promoting Professional Development) over 6 months with 10 sessions (20 contact hrs). COVID-19 required that the MA (13 participants) move to an online format after 3 (out of 10) in-person sessions. We survey 26 self-rated mentoring competencies pre- and post MA, based on a numerical 7-point scale ( published for ACTS 2020) and, in 2020, included additional assessments of online versus in-person MA satisfaction/effectiveness and perceived impact on abilities of MA participants to mentor in an exclusively virtual format. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: All 13 participants responded to the survey and rated the online format as effective (9) or somewhat effective (4) for learning content. However, for participant interactions, only 4 found it effective and 9 somewhat effective. When assessing ability to mentor in a virtual format, most negatively affected competencies were helping your mentee network effectively (7 of 13), motivating your mentee (7), and identifying and accommodating different communication styles (6). Goal setting (research goals, career goals) was rated easier under COVID-19 restrictions by 3 mentors. Increases in Pre-Post self-expressed mentoring effectiveness (+1 pt quality;+1 pt meeting mentee expectations) are similar to historical values, and 12 of the 13 mentors changed mentoring practices based on MA experiences.

Data was collected in Brazil during May 2020 through an online questionnaire which was composed of sociodemographic questions, the Panic Buying Scale (PBS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to assess anxiety and depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to assess stress. 2297 Brazilians (520 men and 1777 women) aged between 18 and 85 years (M = 39.18 years; SD = 14.10 years) answered the questionnaire. Women reported statistically significant higher means' values for anxiety, depression, and stress than men. Though men reported higher panic buying levels than women, the difference was not statistically significant. The regression models revealed that anxiety and stress were panic buying predictors. Comparing gender, the regression models showed that mental health variables (anxiety and stress) explained a higher variance of men's panic buying values than women's values. Hence, there is a significant moderator gender effect between mental health variables and panic buying, as they explained more of the variance of panic buying for men than for women. Psychological support should be provided to individuals, and they should be alerted and educated to the potentially prejudicial outcomes of this type of consumer behavior.

However, the prevalence of AQP4-IgG seropositivity and MOG-IgG seropositivity in isolated ON is unclear, and studies comparing visual outcomes and optical coherence tomography (OCT)-derived structural retinal measures between MS-ON, AQP4-ON, and MOG-ON eyes are limited by small sample sizes. Objectives: (1) To assess the prevalence of AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG seropositivity among patients presenting with isolated ON; (2) to compare visual outcomes and OCT measures between AQP4-ON, MOG-ON, and MS-ON eyes. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a total of 65 eligible studies were identified by PubMed search. Statistical analyses were performed with random effects models. Results: In adults with isolated ON, AQP4-IgG seroprevalence was 4% in non-Asian and 27% in Asian populations, whereas MOG-IgG seroprevalence was 8 and 20%, respectively. In children, AQP4-IgG seroprevalence was 0.4% in non-Asian and 15% in Asian populations, whereas MOG-IgG seroprevalence was 47 and 31%, respectively. AQP4-ON eyes had lower peri-papillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL; -11.7 m, 95% CI: -15.2 to -8.3 m) and macular ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL; -9.0 m, 95% CI: -12.5 to -5.4 m) thicknesses compared with MS-ON eyes. Similarly, pRNFL (-11.2 m, 95% CI: -21.5 to -0.9 m) and GCIPL (-6.1 m, 95% CI: -10.8 to -1.3 m) thicknesses were lower in MOG-ON compared to MS-ON eyes, but did not differ between AQP4-ON and MOG-ON eyes (pRNFL: -1.9 m, 95% CI: -9.1 to 5.4 m; GCIPL: -2.6 m, 95% CI: -8.9 to 3.8 m). Visual outcomes were worse in AQP4-ON compared to both MOG-ON (mean logMAR difference: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.81) and MS-ON eyes (mean logMAR difference: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.96) but were similar in MOG-ON and MS-ON eyes (mean logMAR difference: 0.04, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.14). Conclusions: AQP4-IgG- and MOG-IgG-associated disease are important diagnostic considerations in adults presenting with isolated ON, especially in Asian populations. Furthermore, MOG-IgG seroprevalence is especially high in pediatric isolated ON, in both non-Asian and Asian populations. Despite a similar severity of GCIPL and pRNFL thinning in AQP4-ON and MOG-ON, AQP4-ON is associated with markedly worse visual outcomes.","output":"AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG Related Optic Neuritis-Prevalence, Optical Coherence Tomography Findings, and Visual Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To explore the mediating role of post-traumatic growth and perceived professional benefits between resilience and intent to stay among Chinese nurses to support Wuhan in managing COVID-19.

Until recently, CA treatment options were limited and consisted predominantly of managing symptoms and disease-related complications. However, the last decade has seen significant advances in disease-modifying therapies, increased awareness of CA, and improved diagnostic methods resulting in earlier diagnoses. In this review, we provide an overview of current and experimental treatments for the predominant types of CA: transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) and immunoglobulin light chain (AL)-mediated CA (AL-CA). The mainstay of AL-CA treatment is proteasome inhibitor-based chemotherapy with daratumumab and, when feasible, autologous stem cell transplantation. For ATTR-CA, the stabilizer tafamidis is the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment. However, promising novel therapies on the horizon target various points in the ATTR-CA amyloidogenic cascade. These include transthyretin gene (TTR) silencing agents to prevent TTR formation, TTR tetramer stabilization and inhibition of oligomer aggregation to prevent fibril formation, anti-TTR fiber antibodies, and amyloid degradation. For end-stage CA, advanced interventions may need to be considered, including heart, heart-kidney, and, for hereditary ATTR-CA, heart-liver transplantation. Despite the evolution of treatment options, CA management remains complex due to patient frailty and therapeutic side effects or intolerance with advanced cardiac disease. This is particularly relevant for those with AL-CA, when active teamwork between the hematologist-oncologist and the cardiologist is critical for treatment success.

An integrated framework is proposed to better understand the interrelationships between NPs, ecosystems and the human society. In order to fully understand the sources and sinks of NPs, more studies should focus on the total environment, including freshwater, ocean, groundwater, soil and air, and more attempts should be made to explore the aging and aggregation of NPs in environmentally relevant conditions.

In order to compare the theoretical results, a Monte Carlo simulation experiment is proposed. Generally, we note that for a small true value of the DCRRE, the Bayesian estimates under the linear exponential loss function are favorable compared to the others based on this simulation study. Furthermore, for large true values of the DCRRE, the Bayesian estimate under the precautionary loss function is more suitable than the others. The Bayesian estimates of the DCRRE work well when increasing the sample size.

METHODS: From 14 February to 29 March 2020, an online survey was performed in both 605 health care workers and 1151 non-health care workers. Based on the somatization dimension score of the Symptom Checklist-90, participants were divided into non-SOM group and SOM group. RESULTS: Health care workers had higher prevalence rate of SOM (p < 0.001) than non-health care workers, with an OR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.22-2.36, p = 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that in non-health care workers, the risk factors of SOM included other ethnicities, insomnia, and suicide, while in health care workers, the risk factors included working 6-8 h per day, and working &#8805;10 h per day during COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that both non-health care workers and health care workers have a relatively high prevalence of somatization.

Based on the potential antiviral role of quercetin, and on its described anti-blood clotting, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, we hypothesize that subjects with mild COVID-19 treated with Quercetin Phytosome(?) (QP), a novel bioavailable form of quercetin, may have a shorter time to virus clearance, a milder symptomatology, and higher probabilities of a benign earlier resolution of the disease. METHODS: In our 2-week, randomized, open-label, and controlled clinical study, we have enrolled 42 COVID-19 outpatients. Twenty-one have been treated with the standard of care (SC), and 21 with QP as add-on supplementation to the SC. Our main aims were to check virus clearance and symptoms. RESULTS: The interim results reveal that after 1 week of treatment, 16 patients of the QP group were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and 12 patients had all their symptoms diminished; in the SC group, 2 patients were tested SARS-CoV-2 negative and 4 patients had their symptoms partially improved. By 2 weeks, the remaining 5 patients of the QP group tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, whereas in the SC group out of 19 remaining patients, 17 tested negatives by week 2, one tested negative by week 3 and one patient, still positive, expired by day 20. Concerning blood parameters, the add on therapy with QP, reduced LDH (?35.5%), Ferritin (?40%), CRP (?54.8%) and D-dimer (?11.9%). CONCLUSION: QP statistically shortens the timing of molecular test conversion from positive to negative, reducing at the same time symptoms severity and negative predictors of COVID-19.","output":"Potential Clinical Benefits of Quercetin in the Early Stage of COVID-19: Results of a Second, Pilot, Randomized, Controlled and Open-Label Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared morphology and sequenced nuclear and mitochondrial genes from 11 populations of a previously genetically unstudied Baja California disjunct species, the diamond turbot (Hypsopsetta guttulata). This species exhibits very limited adult movement and restriction to soft-bottom habitats but has a moderately long pelagic larval duration. Therefore, if pelagic larval duration is correlated with gene flow between Gulf of California and Pacific populations, we expect a reduced level of genetic and morphological differentiation. However, if adult habitat and ecology have more effect on gene flow, we expect the populations in the two bodies of water to be more highly differentiated. We used logistic regression to compare morphological features and phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to compare nucleotide sequence data. Gulf of California H. guttulata are different from Pacific populations in morphology and both mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences. MtDNA shows reciprocal monophyly, and nuclear sequences from the Gulf of California formed a monophyletic group.

UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT) family members are responsible for the transfer of a glycosyl moiety from UDP sugars to a wide range of acceptor flavonoids. Baicalin is the major flavonoid glycoside found in S. baicalensis roots, and its aglycone baicalein is synthesized from a specially evolved pathway that has been elucidated. However, it is necessary to carry out a genome-wide study of genes involved in 7-O-glucuronidation, the final biosynthesis step of baicalin, which might elucidate the relationship between the enzymes and the metabolic accumulation patterns in this medicinal plant. RESULTS: We reported the phylogenetic analysis, tissue-specific expression, biochemical characterization and evolutionary analysis of glucosyltransferases (SbUGTs) and glucuronosyltransferases (SbUGATs) genes based on the recently released genome of S. baicalensis. A total of 124 UGTs were identified, and over one third of them were highly expressed in roots. In vitro enzyme assays showed that 6 SbUGTs could use UDP-glucose as a sugar donor and convert baicalein to oroxin A (baicalein 7-O-glucoside), while 4 SbUGATs used only UDP-glucuronic acid as the sugar donor and catalyzed baicalein to baicalin. SbUGAT4 and SbUGT2 are the most highly expressed SbUGAT and SbUGT genes in root tissues, respectively. Kinetic measurements revealed that SbUGAT4 had a lower Km value and higher Vmax/Km ratio to baicalein than those of SbUGT2. Furthermore, tandem duplication events were detected in SbUGTs and SbUGATs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that glucosylation and glucuronidation are two major glycosylated decorations in the roots of S. baicalensis. Higher expression level and affinity to substrate of SbUGAT4, and expansion of this gene family contribute high accumulation of baicalin in the root of S. baicalensis.

Case-fatality rates (CFR) vary significantly in different case series, and some patients were still hospitalized at the time of analyses. To our knowledge, no case-control study of COVID-19 in OTR has been published to-date. METHODS: We captured kidney transplant recipients (KTR) diagnosed with COVID-19 between 3/1 and 5/18/2020. After exclusion of KTR on hemodialysis and off immunosuppression (IS), we compared the clinical course of COVID-19 between hospitalized KTR and non-transplant patients, matched by sex and age (controls). All patients were discharged from the hospital or died. RESULTS: 16 KTR had COVID-19. All 3 KTR off IS, who were excluded from further analyses, survived. Median age was 54 (range: 34C65) years; 5/13 KTR (38.4%) were men. Median time from transplant was 41 (range: 1C203) months. Two KTR, both transplanted >10 years ago, were managed as outpatients. IS was reduced in 12/13 (92.3%), most often by discontinuation of the antimetabolite. IL6 levels were >1,000 (normal: < 5) pg/mL in 3 KTR. Tacrolimus or sirolimus levels were >10 ng/mL in 6/9 KTR (67%) (Table 1). Eleven KTR were hospitalized (84.6%) and matched with 44 controls. One KTR, the only one treated with hydroxychloroquine, died (CFR 5.8%; 7.6% in KTR on IS; 9% in hospitalized KTR on IS). Four controls died (CFR: 9%; state CFR: 5.2%; inpatient CFR: 16.6%). There were no significant differences in length of stay or worst oxygenation status between hospitalized KTR and controls. Four KTR (30.7%), received remdesivir, 4 convalescent plasma, 3 (23%) tocilizumab. KTR received more often broad-spectrum antibiotics, convalescent plasma or tocilizumab, compared to controls (Table 2).

However, so far, no effective drugs or vaccines have been developed. Whereas, the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been considered as a promising supplementary treatment for the disease owing to its clinically proven performance on many diseases even like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Meanwhile, many side-effect (SE) reports suggest the SE of the TCM prescriptions cannot be ignored in curing the COVID-19, especially because COVID-19 always simultaneously leads to dramatic degradation of the patientsphysical condition. How to evaluate the TCM regarding to their latent SE is a urgent challenge. Aim of the study: In this study, we use an ontology-based side-effect prediction framework (OSPF) developed in our previous work and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based deep learning to evaluate the TCM prescriptions that are officially recommended in China for novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Materials and methods: Firstly, we adopted the OSPF developed in our previous work, where an ontology-based model separate all the ingredients in a TCM prescription into two categories: hot and cold. Then, we established a database by converting each TCM prescription into a vector containing the ingredient dosage and the according hot/cold attribution as well as the safe/unsafe label. And, we trained the ANN model using this database, after which a safety indicator (SI), as the complementary percentage of side-effect (SE) possibility, is then given for each TCM prescription. According to the proposed SI from high to low, we re-organize the recommended prescription list. Secondly, by using this method, we also evaluate the safety indicators of some other famous TCM prescriptions that are not in the recommended list but are used traditionally to cure flu-like diseases for extending the potential treatments. Results: Based on the SI generated in the ANN model, FTS, PMSP, and SF are the safest ones in recommended list, which all own a more-than-0.8 SI. Whereas, JHQG, LHQW, SFJD, XBJ, and SHL are the prescriptions that are most likely unsafe, where the indicators are all below 0.2. In the extra list, the indicators of XC, XQRS, CC, and CHBX are all above 0.8, and at the meantime, XZXS, SJ, QW, and KBDs indicators are all below 0.2. Conclusions: In total, there are seven TCM prescriptions which own the indicators more than 0.8, suggesting these prescriptions should be considered firstly in curing COVID-19, if suitable. We believe this work will provide a reasonable suggestion for the society to choose proper TCM as the supplementary treatment for COVID-19. Besides, this work also introduces a pilot and enlightening method for creating a more reasonable recommendation list of TCM to other diseases.","output":"Evaluating the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Officially Recommended in China for COVID-19 Using Ontology-Based Side-Effect Prediction Framework (OSPF) and Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human antibody response has special significance in the ongoing efforts to develop a protective HIV vaccine.

Methods: This study entailed designing a standardized web-based questionnaire for conducting a survey among dental practitioners from all specializations. Here, 100 participants answered 14 questions related to the role of oil pulling in treating oral symptoms common among COVID-19 patients and immunocompromised radiation patients. Statistical analysis was carried out after receiving all responses. Frequencies and percentages were calculated. Results: The results of the present survey indicated that 8.6% of total participants had good awareness (16 Qs);56.3% of total participants showed moderate awareness (10u16 Qs);while 35.2% had poor awareness (<10 Qs). Conclusion: Oil pulling can be deemed as an effective method of treating oral symptoms of COVID-19. Dentists should acquire adequate knowledge regarding the role and importance of this simple preventive measure.","output":"Awareness among dental practitioners about oil pulling u Its effect on the Corona Virus and immunocompromised patients: A questionnaire-based survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: As the landscape of health care continues to shift, providing mental health and pain management services via telehealth is becoming an ideal option to increase accessibility of care Research demonstrates the benefit of biofeedback-assisted relaxation training (BART) for children During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians required to use telehealth needed an alternative to provide ongoing services This commentary seeks to illustrate the benefits of offering BART virtually with discussing considerations and future directions Method: An existing BART protocol was modified for telehealth delivery Variations to the approach included increased psychoeducation, more parental engagement, and a greater focus on mobile applications (apps) in treatment Mobile apps were used to introduce relaxation strategies, encourage practice outside of session, and obtain physiological measurements pre- and postpractice of relaxation strategies Results: Clinicians quickly pivoted their approach and provided services without interruption Protocol changes illustrated the need for more thorough description of treatment sessions, increased focus on privacy and ethical considerations, and age-related factors Conclusions: As the uncertainty of the pandemic continues, it is important for clinicians to innovate to provide effective remote clinical interventions for patients and families Future research studies examining the provision of BART via telehealth and its impact on pain and overall functioning are warranted (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Identifying innovative modalities to offer biofeedback assisted relaxation training (BART) to pediatric populations with chronic medical conditions is critical in increasing accessibility of care Clinicians may consider modifying their BART protocols to offer this intervention via telehealth or in a hybrid manner (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Offering biofeedback assisted relaxation training in a virtual world: Considerations and future directions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The duodenal switch is the most effective bariatric surgical procedure. Due to technical demands of the surgery and concerns regarding high rates of post-operative nutritional sequelae, many surgeons remain hesitant to adopt this technique. METHODS Sixty-five patients undergoing duodenal switch surgery at our hospital between 2008 and 2015 were followed up for 5 years. All patients were provided with a thorough post-operative nutritional supplementation regimen. Nutritional deficiencies as evidenced by blood testing, excess body weight loss, and remission rates from type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia were studied. RESULTS The average excess body weight loss 5 years post-operatively was 62%  23.03%. Remission rates for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia were 96%, 77% and 84% respectively. Patients achieved good nutritional outcomes. After 5 years, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins A and D occurred in 3.3% and 1.6% of patients respectively. The rate of ferritin deficiency at the 5-year post-operative mark was 19.4%. No predictors of nutritional deficiency were identified on univariate analysis. CONCLUSION Patients undergoing a duodenal switch achieve good long-term excess body weight loss and high obesity-related co-morbidity remission rates. The rates of post-operative nutritional deficiencies in patients who are subjected to a thorough post-operative nutritional supplementation regimen are lower than what was historically expected.","output":"Duodenal Switch Combined with Systematic Post-operative Supplementation and Regular Patient Follow-up Results in Good Nutritional Outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Our study aims to assess the impact of lockdown during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on glycemic control and psychological well-being in youths with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We compared glycemic metrics during lockdown with the same period of 2019. The psychological impact was evaluated with the Test of Anxiety and Depression. RESULTS: We analyzed metrics of 117 adolescents (87% on Multiple Daily Injections and 100% were flash glucose monitoring/continuous glucose monitoring users). During the lockdown, we observed an increase of the percentage of time in range (TIR) (p<0.001), with a significant reduction of time in moderate (p=0.002), and severe hypoglycemia (p=0.001), as well as the percentage of time in hyperglycemia (p<0.001). Glucose variability did not differ (p=0.863). The glucose management indicator was lower (p=0.001). 7% of youths reached the threshold-score (&#8805;115) for anxiety and 16% for depression. A higher score was associated with lower TIR [p=0.028, p=0.012]. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control improved during the first lockdown period with respect to the previous year. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with worse glycemic control; future researches are necessary to establish if this improvement is transient and if psychological difficulties will increase during the prolonged pandemic situation.","output":"Anxiety, depression, and glycemic control during Covid-19 pandemic in youths with type 1 diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"Will an obesity pandemic replace the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For over 40 years, attempts to develop treatments that protect neurons and other brain cells against the cellular and biochemical consequences of cerebral ischaemia in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) have been unsuccessful.

In this context, cytoprotective treatments should be revisited as adjunctive treatment to reperfusion therapy. Renewed efforts should focus on developing new drugs that target multiple aspects of the ischaemic cascade, and previously developed drugs should be reconsidered if they produced robust cytoprotective effects in preclinical models and their safety profiles were reasonable in previous clinical trials.

We explored the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on projected SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada. METHODS We developed an agestructured agent-based model of the Canadian population simulating the impact of current and projected levels of public health interventions on SARSCoV- 2 transmission. Interventions included case detection and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, physical distancing and community closures, evaluated alone and in combination. RESULTS Without any interventions, 64.6% (95% credible interval [CrI] 63.9%-65.0%) of Canadians will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (total attack rate) and 3.6% (95% CrI 2.4%-3.8%) of those infected will die. If case detection and contact tracing continued at baseline levels without maintained physical distancing and reimplementation of restrictive measures, this combination brought the total attack rate to 56.1% (95% CrI 0.05%-57.1%), but it dropped to 0.4% (95% CrI 0.03%-23.5%) with enhanced case detection and contact tracing. Combining the latter scenario with maintained physical distancing reduced the total attack rate to 0.2% (95% CrI 0.03%-1.7%) and was the only scenario that consistently kept hospital and intensive care unit bed use under capacity, prevented nearly all deaths and eliminated the epidemic. Extending school closures had minimal effects but did reduce transmission in schools; however, extending closures of workplaces and mixed-age venues markedly reduced attack rates and usually or always eliminated the epidemic under any scenario. INTERPRETATION Controlling SARSCoV- 2 transmission will depend on enhancing and maintaining interventions at both the community and individual levels. Without such interventions, a resurgent epidemic will occur, with the risk of overwhelming our health care systems.","output":"Projected effects of nonpharmaceutical public health interventions to prevent resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The report presents the results of the second wave of research conducted among the students of the Pedagogical University of Krakw.

The objective of this study was to determine if the period of these infection control measures was associated with changes in overall population mortality due to causes other than SARS. METHODS: Observational study of death registry data, using Poisson regression and interrupted time-series analysis to examine all-cause mortality rates (excluding deaths due to SARS) before, during, and after the SARS outbreak. The population of Ontario was grouped into the Greater Toronto Area (N = 2.9 million) and the rest of Ontario (N = 9.3 million) based upon the level of restrictions on delivery of clinical services during the SARS outbreak. RESULTS: There was no significant change in mortality in the Greater Toronto Area before, during, and after the period of the SARS outbreak in 2003 compared to the corresponding time periods in 2002 and 2001. The rate ratio for all-cause mortality during the SARS outbreak was 0.99 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.93C1.06] compared to 2002 and 0.96 [95% CI 0.90C1.03] compared to 2001. An interrupted time series analysis found no significant change in mortality rates in the Greater Toronto Area associated with the period of the SARS outbreak. CONCLUSION: Limitations on access to medical services during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto had no observable impact on short-term population mortality.

Secondary outcomes were postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), return of gastrointestinal function, in-hospital complications, quality of recovery, and plasma creatinine. The proportion of dehydrated patients at surgery was 20.4%. Dehydration did not correlate with quality of recovery, PONV, or other complications, but dehydrated patients showed later defecation (p = 0.02) and significant elevations of plasma creatinine after surgery. The elevations were also greater when plasma creatinine had increased rather than decreased during the 24 h prior to surgery (p < 0.001). Overall, the increase in plasma creatinine at 6 h after surgery correlated well with elevations on postoperative days one and two. In conclusion, we found preoperative dehydration in one-fifth of the patients. Dehydration was associated with delayed defecation and elevated postoperative plasma creatinine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Laparoscopic right colectomy was performed in 78 patients (10 with benign disease, 68 with carcinoma). Demographic, intraoperative, pathologic examination, and short-term outcome data were retrospectively compared between 25 patients operated by surgical residents (R group) and 53 patients operated by senior surgeons (S group). The residents who performed surgeries in the R group had between 1 and 6 years after graduation; no experience with open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery was necessary. The residents completed a training program under supervision of a single expert laparoscopic colorectal surgeon, which included 6 steps, from basic skills to certification. RESULTS There were no differences in patient age, sex, and body mass index between the R and S groups. Significantly more patients in the R group had early cancer and benign lesions (P<0.05). Thirteen of the 16 residents (81.2 %) had not had prior experience with colonic resection. The time of suturing and knot tying in the dry box did not differ between residents and senior surgeons (68 and 69 s, respectively). All the residents performed laparoscopic right colectomy without intraoperative complications. There were no significant differences in operating time (R group: 17334 min, S group: 17252 min), mean estimated blood loss (50111 vs. 49100 mL), number of lymph nodes dissected (20.812.8 vs. 17.19.0), and mean postoperative hospital stay (9.13.3 vs. 10.74.1 d). On the basis of the year of their residency period, all 3 residents at 6 years after graduation had far greater experience than the other residents and therefore performed the surgery with minor verbal support from the expert. However, residents with 1 or 2 years after graduation had to receive guidance provision by the expert during surgery.

Adipose tissue demonstrates high expression of ACE2 which SARS- CoV-2 exploits to enter host cells. This makes adipose tissue a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 viruses and thus increases the integral viral load. Acute viral infection results in ACE2 downregulation. This relative deficiency can lead to disturbances in other systems controlled by ACE2, including the renin-angiotensin system. This will be further increased in the case of pre-conditions with already compromised functioning of these systems, such as in patients with obesity and diabetes. Here, we propose that interactions of virally-induced ACE2 deficiency with obesity and/or diabetes leads to a synergistic further impairment of endothelial and gut barrier function.

In particular, restricted vaccine access and hesitancy have limited immunization rates. In addition, current vaccines are unable to prevent breakthrough infections, leading to prolonged virus circulation. To improve access, a subunit vaccine with enhanced thermostability was designed to eliminate the need for an ultra-cold chain. The exclusion of infectious and genetic materials from this vaccine may also help reduce vaccine hesitancy. In an effort to prevent breakthrough infections, intranasal immunization to induce mucosal immunity was explored. A prototype vaccine comprised of receptor-binding domain (RBD) polypeptides formulated with additional immunoadjuvants in a chitosan (CS) solution induced high levels of RBD-specific antibodies in laboratory mice after 1 or 2 immunizations. Antibody responses were durable with high titers persisting for at least five months following subcutaneous vaccination. Serum anti-RBD antibodies contained both IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes suggesting that the vaccine induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response. RBD vaccination without CS formulation resulted in minimal anti-RBD responses. The addition of CpG oligonucleotides to the CS plus RBD vaccine formulation increased antibody titers more effectively than interleukin-12 (IL-12). Importantly, generated antibodies were cross-reactive against RBD mutants associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including alpha, beta and delta variants, and inhibited binding of RBD to its cognate receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). With respect to stability, vaccines did not lose activity when stored at either room temperature (21-22C) or 4C for at least one month. When delivered intranasally, vaccines induced RBD-specific mucosal IgA antibodies, which may protect against breakthrough infections in the upper respiratory tract. Altogether, data indicate that the designed vaccine platform is versatile, adaptable and capable of overcoming key constraints of current COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Intranasal Delivery of Thermostable Subunit Vaccine for Cross-Reactive Mucosal and Systemic Antibody Responses Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care tests (POCT) are promising tools to detect SARS-CoV-2 in specific settings. Initial reports suggest the ID NOW&#8482; COVID-19 assay (Abbott Diagnostics Inc, USA) is less sensitive than standard real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. This has raised concern over false negatives in SARS-CoV-2 POCT. OBJECTIVES: We compared the performance of the ID NOW&#8482; COVID-19 assay to our in-house rRT-PCR assay to assess whether dry swabs used in ID NOW&#8482; testing could be stored in transport media and be re-tested by rRT-PCR for redundancy and to provide material for further investigation. METHODS: Paired respiratory swabs collected from patients at three acute care hospitals were used. One swab in transport media (McMaster Molecular Media (MMM)) was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by a laboratory-developed two-target rRT-PCR assay. The second was stored dry in a sterile container and tested by the ID NOW&#8482; COVID-19 assay. Following ID NOW&#8482; testing, dry swabs were stored in MMM for up to 48 h and re-tested by rRT-PCR. Serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 particles were used to assess the impact of heat inactivation and storage time. RESULTS: Respiratory swabs (n = 343) from 179 individuals were included. Using rRT-PCR results as the comparator, the ID NOW&#8482; COVID-19 assay had positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreements of 87.0% (95% CI:0.74-0.94) and 99.7% (95% CI:0.98-0.99).

They include general recommendations, applicable across all phases of an accident, and specific recommendations for each of the three main phases: preparedness, early and intermediate, and long-term recovery. The recommendations are subdivided by topic: health surveillance, epidemiological studies, dose reconstruction, evacuation, and training of and communication with health personnel and other actors involved in liaising with affected populations. Each recommendation is divided into 3 sections - why, how and who - thus providing background and concrete advice as to how each SHAMISEN recommendation should be implemented and by whom. It is notable that many recommendations are also applicable to other disaster types, including the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"The SHAMISEN Recommendations on preparedness and health surveillance of populations affected by a radiation accident."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present qualitative research explores the factors that have influenced the use of urban green spaces (UGS) in Mexico City during the COVID-19 pandemic and the implications of their usage on residents' well-being. This study was conducted using a combination of solicited audio and written diaries, photography, and in-depth interviews with 16 participants, aged 22 to 58. The article provides a critical reflection on the incentives and deterrents to the UGS use of participants while social distancing measures were in place. The results show that in Mexico City: (1) participants' lack of access to UGS has hampered their use, mainly among those of low-income neighborhoods;(2) UGS size did not directly impact participants' UGS use during the pandemic;and (3) women were deterred from accessing UGS due to safety concerns related to the fear of violence. Overall, the results suggest that UGS use has served as a coping mechanism to decrease the effects of stress and isolation caused by the pandemic, increasing users' physical and mental well-being. This study's conclusions can help develop future citizen participation tools that are useful for resilience in urban design, as they provide interesting insights into the perceptions of residents, such as the most valued characteristics of UGS.","output":"Snapshot of the Use of Urban Green Spaces in Mexico City during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but severe condition resulting in excessive response of the immune system after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report a single-center cohort of children with MIS-C, describing the spectrum of presentation, therapies, clinical course, and short-term outcomes. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study from to a tertiary pediatric rheumatology center including patients (aged 1 month to 21 years) diagnosed with MIS-C between April 2020-April 2021. Demographic, clinical, laboratory results and follow-up data were collected through the electronic patient record system and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients with MIS-C were included in the study. Fever was detected in all patients; gastrointestinal system symptoms were found in 67.2% of the patients, rash in 38.8%, conjunctivitis in 31.3%, hypotension in 26.9% myocarditis, and/or pericarditis in 22.4%, respectively. Respiratory symptoms were only in five patients (7.5%). Kawasaki Disease like presentation was found 37.3% of the patients. The mean duration of hospitalization was 11.8 7.07 days. Fifty-seven patients (85%) received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 45 (67%) received corticosteroids, 17 (25.3%) received anakinra, and one (1.5%) received tocilizumab. Seven of the patients (10.4%) underwent therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). In 21 (31.3%) patients, a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was required in a median of 2 days. The first finding to improve was fever, while the first parameter to decrease was ferritin (median 6.5 days (IQR, 4C11.2 days)). Sixty-five patients were discharged home with a median duration of hospital stay of 10 days (IQR, 7C15 days). CONCLUSION: Patients with MIS-C may have severe cardiac findings and intensive care requirements in admission and hospital follow-up. The vast majority of these findings improve with effective treatment without any sequelae until discharge and in a short time in follow-up. Although the pathogenesis and treatment plan of the disease are partially elucidated, follow-up studies are needed in terms of long-term prognosis and relapse probabilities.","output":"The clinical course and short-term health outcomes of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in the single pediatric rheumatology center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has become a complex problem that overlaps with a growing public health problem, obesity. Obesity alters different components of the innate and adaptive immune responses, creating a chronic and low-grade state of inflammation. Nutritional status is closely related to a better or worse prognosis of viral infections. Excess weight has been recognised as a risk factor for COVID-19 complications. In addition to the direct risk, obesity triggers other diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, increasing the risk of severe COVID-19. The present review explains the diets that induce obesity and the importance of different foods in this process. We also review tissue disruption in obesity, leading to impaired immune responses and the possible mechanisms by which obesity and its co-morbidities increase COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Nutritional strategies that support the immune system in patients with obesity and with COVID-19 are also discussed in light of the available data, considering the severity of the infection.

METHODS: A total of 45 endodontic procedures were sampled, including full pulpotomy (n=15), pulpectomy (n=15), and NSRCT (n=15). Samples were collected during room resting (s1) and after the treatment (s2). The passive air sampling technique using settle plates was applied. Agar plates were set at different locations in the operatory. The colony-forming unit (CFU) was counted in BHI blood agar plates. A set of agar plates containing selective chromogenic culture media was used for the isolation and presumptive identification of target microorganisms. Fungi were investigated using Sabouraud Dextrose Agar. RESULTS: Pulpotomy generated the lowest mean CFU count (p<0.05). There was no difference between the mean CFU counts found in pulpectomy and NSRCT (p>0.05). A higher mean CFU count was found close to the patients mouth (0.5m) than at a 2m distance in pulpectomy and NSRCT (P<0.05). There was no difference between the mean CFU count found in front of the patients mouth versus diagonal in pulpectomy and NSRCT (p>0.05).

Additionally, recurrent pandemics cause massive morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infection may result in rapid progressive viral pneumonia with fatal outcome. Since accurate treatment strategies are still missing, research refocuses attention to lung pathology and cellular crosstalk to develop new therapeutic options. Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) play an important role in orchestrating the pulmonary antiviral host response. After IV infection they release a cascade of immune mediators, one of which is granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF is known to promote differentiation, activation and mobilization of myeloid cells. In the lung, GM-CSF drives immune functions of alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and also improves epithelial repair processes through direct interaction with AECs. During IV infection, AEC-derived GM-CSF shows a lung-protective effect that is also present after local GM-CSF application. This mini-review provides an overview on GM-CSF-modulated immune responses to IV pneumonia and its therapeutic potential in severe IV pneumonia.","output":"Lung epithelial GM-CSF improves host defense function and epithelial repair in influenza virus pneumoniaa new therapeutic strategy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep learning classifiers are assisting humans in making decisions and hence the user's trust in these models is of paramount importance.

This paper studies a model behavior in the context of periodic retraining of deployed models where the outputs from successive generations of the models might not agree on the correct labels assigned to the same input. We formally define consistency and correct-consistency of a learning model. We prove that consistency and correct-consistency of an ensemble learner is not less than the average consistency and correct-consistency of individual learners and correct-consistency can be improved with a probability by combining learners with accuracy not less than the average accuracy of ensemble component learners.

To address this challenge, we propose a model policy for resuscitation and emergent procedure policy of patients with EVD and set forth ethical principles that lend support to this policy. The policy and principles we propose bear relevance beyond the EVD epidemic, offering guidance for the care of patients with other highly contagious, virulent, and lethal diseases. The policy establishes (1) a limited code status for patients with confirmed or suspected EVD. Limited code status means that a code blue will not be called for patients with confirmed or suspected EVD at any stage of the disease; however, properly protected providers (those already in full protective equipment) may initiate resuscitative efforts if, in their clinical assessment, these efforts are likely to benefit the patient. The policy also requires that (2) resuscitation not be attempted for patients with advanced EVD, as resuscitation would be medically futile; (3) providers caring for or having contact with patients with confirmed or suspected EVD be properly protected and trained; (4) the treating team identify and treat in advance likely causes of cardiac and respiratory arrest to minimize the need for emergency response; (5) patients with EVD and their proxies be involved in care discussions; and (6) care team and provider discretion guide the care of patients with EVD.

We determined the longevity and persistence of vaccine-induced antibody response in NSCLC patients. The effect of vaccine-type, age, gender, race and cancer therapy on the antibody response was evaluated. Results: Binding antibody titer to the mRNA vaccines were lower in the NSCLC patients compared to the healthy volunteers (P=<0.0001). More importantly, NSCLC patients had reduced live-virus neutralizing activity compared to the healthy vaccinees (P=<0.0001). Spike and RBD-specific binding IgG titers peaked after a week following the second vaccine dose and declined after six months (P=<0.001). While patients >70 years had lower IgG titers (P=<0.01), patients receiving either PD-1 monotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination of both did not have a significant impact on the antibody response.

The aim of the present study was to examine drug use trends in patients with AORCs in ambulatory care and to study age-specific drug use. METHODS Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the outpatient department component of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to examine ambulatory visits for AORCs during 2001-2005. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics (narcotics and nonnarcotics), steroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatoid drugs (DMARDs) was measured as the proportion of visits that resulted in a prescription. Age-specific drug use trends were determined separately for adult (19-64 years) and for elderly (> or = 65 years) patients. RESULTS According to the national surveys, there were 208 million ambulatory visits for AORCs during the study period. Use of NSAIDs, analgesics, steroids, and DMARDs was found to be 33.3%, 23.5%, 15.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. Analgesic use increased from 18.3% in 2001 to 26.7% in 2005.

President Jair Bolsonaro's dangerous brew of neoliberal authoritarianism, science denialism and ableism has plunged this country into catastrophe. In this article we argue that this form (or lack) of public health governance can best be described as governance without (central) government. We begin with an overview of public health governance in the country before introducing the main theoretical concepts that guide our analysis, namely the notions of 'government by exception' and 'strategic ignorance'. Finally, we sketch the main features of this emerging form of (non)governance of COVID-19. We highlight the new forms of solidarity and mutual aid that have emerged in favelas and Indigenous communities, which have stepped in to fill the void left by a limited federal presence.

The demand for high quality face masks has seen an upsurge in the recent times, leading to exploration of alternative economic and easily available options, without compromising on the quality. Particle removal from air in terms of capture efficiency of the filter media or the face mask is a crucial parameter for testing and quality assurance. Short-term reusability of the face masks is also an important aspect as the demand for masks will potentially outstrip the supply in future. Sterilization Wraps, which are used to wrap sterile surgical instruments, have shown a promising performance in terms of removal of particles from air. In this study, we evaluate the particle filtration characteristics of face masks made of 2 different metric weights [45 and 60 gram per square metre (GSM)] respectively, using locally available Sterilization Wraps. The aerosol filtration characteristics were also studied after sterilisation by different techniques such as heat with 50% humidity (thermal treatment), ethylene oxide (ETO), steam and radiation dose of 30kGy. We found that 60 GSM face mask had particle capture efficiency of 94% for total particles greater than 0.3 microns and this capture efficiency was maintained even after sterilisation with ETO and thermal treatment. The cost of producing these masks was 30 US cents/mask at our institute. Our study suggests that sterilization wrap material made of non-woven polypropylene spunbond-meltblown-spunbond (SMS) fibres could be an appropriate readily available inexpensive material for making face masks or N95 respirators.","output":"Particle removal from air by face masks made from Sterilization Wraps: Effectiveness and Reusability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Emergency healthcare workers (HCW) are the first point of contact for patients with traumatic injuries and acute illnesses.

Vaccination is a major tool for preventing HBV infections. The protection provided by the COVID-19 vaccines are yet under evaluation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the HBV and COVID-19 vaccination coverage and the serological hepatitis B immunity among nurse aides working in the emergency department (EM) in a secondary hospital in Portugal. Material and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted by analyzing the Occupational Health Service database of Centro Hospitalar do Baixo Vouga in Aveiro, considering active nurse aides working in the EM in August 2021. Results and Conclusions: Of the total 71 workers included in the study, 61 (85.9%) had completed the vaccination against HBV. From these fully vaccinated HCW, 45 (73.7%) had confirmation of protective Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) levels (>10 mIU/mL) and 11 (18.3%) had unknown HBsAb levels. Regarding COVID-19 vaccination, 68 (95.7%) of the 71 total workers, had complete vaccination. From these, 43 (63.2%) had the last shot more than 6 months ago. Overall, there is a good adherence of nurse aides working in the EM to HBV and COVID-19 vaccination.

The turret of turreted dsRNA viruses belonging to the family Reoviridae is formed by five copies of the turret protein, which contains domains with both 7-N-methyltransferase and 2-O-methyltransferase activities, and serves to catalyze the methylation reactions during RNA capping. Cypovirus of the family Reoviridae provides a good model system for studying the methylation reactions in dsRNA viruses. Here, we present the structure of a transcribing cypovirus to a resolution of ~ 3.8 ? by cryo-electron microscopy. The binding sites for both S-adenosyl-l-methionine and RNA in the two methyltransferases of the turret were identified. Structural analysis of the turret in complex with RNA revealed a pathway through which the RNA molecule reaches the active sites of the two methyltransferases before it is released into the cytoplasm. The pathway shows that RNA capping reactions occur in the active sites of different turret protein monomers, suggesting that RNA capping requires concerted efforts by at least three turret protein monomers. Thus, the turret structure provides novel insights into the precise mechanisms of RNA methylation.","output":"Identification of the Active Sites in the Methyltransferases of a Transcribing dsRNA Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Previous studies have examined the association between socioeconomic status and prosocial behavior, but the underlying mechanism between them is unclear.

How far are developing countries like India (with wide socioeconomic and cultural diversity) geared up for this challenge remains unexplored. At this critical juncture, we aim to evaluate if online teaching methods are as feasible, acceptable, and effective as in-class teaching for medical/nursing students. OBJECTIVES: The questionnaire captured: (1) practicability/feasibility of online classes, (2) health issues from online classes, (3) current methods for e-teaching, and (4) student attitudes and preferences. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTINGS: Population-based study in India. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing and medical undergraduate students (I-IV year). METHODOLOGY: The online questionnaire was distributed to 200 medical and nursing colleges across India. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Binary logistic regression was done to analyze factors predicting health issues in students. p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Overall, 1541 medical and 684 nursing students completed the survey from 156 cities. The availability of laptop (p < 0.0001), Wi-Fi (p < 0.0001), dedicated room (p < 0.0001), and computer proficiency was more in students of affluent families and those from cities (p < 0.0001).

Power-point presentation was the most widely (80%) used method of teaching. Only 30% got adequate time to interact with teachers. Only 20.4% felt e-learning can replace conventional teaching. Students preferred: 3-6 classes/day, each class <40 min, 10-20 min break between classes and interactive sessions. CONCLUSION: There is a need to improve information and communication infrastructure to enhance feasibility of e-learning for nursing/medical students in India. There should be guidelines (number of classes/day, length of each class, break between classes, curriculum, etc) to improve the retention capacity in students and reduce health issues.

At that time, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission had report 27 cases, of which seven are severely ill, and the remaining cases are stable and controllable. Since, then, the spread of COVID-19 has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. As of September 07, 2020, there had been more than 27 million confirmed cases and 889,000 total deaths, with an average mortality of about 3.3%, globally. In Ethiopia, 58,672 confirmed cases and 918 deaths and this number are likely to increase exponentially. It is critical to detect clusters of COVID-19 to better allocate resources and improve decision-making as the pandemics continue to grow. Methods: We have collected the individual-level information on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 on daily bases from the official reports of the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), regional, and city government of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa health bureaus. Using the daily case data, we conducted a prospective space-time analysis with SaTScan version 9.6.

In this paper the effects of diurnal pollen variations have been evaluated in two sites characterized by different vegetation and urbanization: the suburban site of Tor Vergata (TV) and the rural site of Monte Porzio Catone (MPC). Aerobiological and meteorological monitoring was performed in the two sites during the winter of 2017. The data analysis focuses on the comparison between pollen concentrations observed in relation to meteorological variables. In general, it can be stated that the indoor and outdoor dynamics for MPC and TV are different, with the outdoor concentration of pollen for MPC always higher than for TV, in accordance with significant presence of vegetation. The high nocturnal peaks detected in MPC and completely absent in TV could be caused by the presence of particular conditions of stagnation combined with greater emissions from the pollen sources. Furthermore the higher I/O ratio observed during the working hours in TV compared to MPC could be ascribed to the workers behavior.

Recent trauma society guidelines suggesting that all children over 15 years old should receive thromboprophylaxis may result in overtreatment. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of a previously published VTE prediction algorithm and compare it to current recommendations. METHODS: Two institutional trauma registries were queried for all pediatric (age < 18 years) patients admitted from 2007 to 2018. Clinical data were applied to the algorithm and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated to test algorithm efficacy. RESULTS: A retrospective review identified 8271 patients with 30 episodes of VTE (0.36%). The VTE prediction algorithm classified 51 (0.6%) as high risk (> 5% risk), 322 (3.9%) as moderate risk (1C5% risk) and 7898 (95.5%) as low risk (< 1% risk). AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89C0.97). In our population, prophylaxis of the moderate- and high-risk cohorts would outperform the sensitivity (60% vs. 53%) and specificity (96% vs. 77%) of current guidelines while anticoagulating substantially fewer patients (373 vs. 1935, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A VTE prediction algorithm using clinical variables can identify injured children at risk for venous thromboembolic disease with more discrimination than current guidelines. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the validity of this model. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IIIClinical decision rule evaluated in a single population.

Distance learning has become the norm, and an evaluation of learning achievement is needed. This is a mixed-method study of teaching presence, self-regulated learning, and learning satisfaction in distance learning to evaluate the learning achievement of students in a nursing education program. Ninety-four students for quantitative and seven students for qualitative research were sampled. All the sampled students attend the nursing education program in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province and were enrolled during the first semester of 2020. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS/WIN 21.0, and qualitative data were analyzed via content analysis in NVivo 12. Teaching presence and self-regulated learning were identified as the factors affecting learning satisfaction. In a focus group interview, teaching presence increased when the students received feedback and saw the faces of their professors. Self-regulated learning occurred when they had opportunities to practice self-study and leadership and when they formed relationships between professors and colleagues. These methods have also been recognized to increase learning satisfaction. Considering the results of this study, it is necessary to develop teaching methods that enhance the learning satisfaction of students in distance learning nursing education programs.","output":"Teaching Presence, Self-Regulated Learning and Learning Satisfaction on Distance Learning for Students in a Nursing Education Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction.

METHODS: The data consisted of information on outbreaks of waterborne and foodborne infectious diseases reported through the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) system. We analyzed the trends and epidemiological aspects of outbreaks by month, place of occurrence, and causative pathogens in this observational study. RESULTS: The number of outbreaks has steadily increased over the last 5 years, but the number of cases per outbreak has followed a decreasing trend. Incidence at daycare centers and preschools has been steadily increasing over consecutive years. CONCLUSION: The steady number of patients and decreasing number of cases per outbreak, even as the number of outbreaks has been increasing, suggest that the KCDCs professional management system is operating effectively. It is necessary to continue improving the objectivity and efficiency of the management system and to carefully examine the increasing number of outbreaks in smaller-scale group catering facilities, such as daycare centers and preschools.

There is evolving literature in utilizing proning among non-intubated and hypoxemic patients with novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is paucity of evidence proving a sustained improvement in patient-centered outcomes. We aimed to determine the association between prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 and incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or in-hospital mortality. Methods: We conducted a nested matched case-control analysis of adult COVID-19 patients admitted to three hospital sites in Bronx, NY between March 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020. Patients with do-not-intubate orders were excluded. Cases were defined by IMV or in-hospital mortality. Each case was matched with two controls based on age, gender, admission date within two weeks, and hospital length of stay greater than index time of matched case via risk-set sampling. Index time was defined as time after hospital admission when the case was intubated or died, whichever came first. The presence of non-intubated proning was identified from provider documentation. Results: We included 600 patients, 41 (6.8%) underwent non-intubated proning. Cases had lower SpO2/FiO2 (S/F) ratios prior to IMV or in-hospital mortality compared to controls (case median, 97 [interquartile range, 90-290] versus control median, 404 [interquartile range, 296-452]). While most providers (58.5%) documented immediate improvement in oxygenation status after initiating non-intubated proning, there was no difference in worst S/F ratios before and after non-intubated proning in both case and control (case median S/F ratio difference, 3 [interquartile range,-3-8] versus control median S/F ratio difference, 0 [interquartile range,-3-50]). In the univariate analysis, patients who underwent non-intubated proning were 2.57 times more likely to require IMV or experience in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, 2.57;95% confidence interval, 1.17-5.64;P =.02). Following adjustment for patient level differences, we found no association between non-intubated proning and IMV or inhospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.92;95% confidence interval, 0.34-2.45;P =.86). Conclusions: Although many providers documented an immediate improvement in oxygenation after non-intubated proning, sustained improvement was not identified. Non-intubated proning did not reduce the need for IMV or in-hospital mortality after adjustment for severity of illness and oxygenation status. While non-intubated proning may temporarily improve hypoxemia, it may lead to harmful delays in intubation and respiratory complications.

In this study, we have developed a specific, sensitive, quantitative and fast detection method for SARS-CoV-2 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The total extracellular protease proteolytic activity from the virus has been used as the biomarker. The specific peptide sequences from the library of 115 dipeptides were identified via changes in the fluorescence signal. The fluorogenic dipeptide substrates have the fluorophore and a quencher at the N- and the C- terminals, respectively. When the protease hydrolyzes the peptide bond between the two specific amino acids, it leads to a significant increase in the fluorescence signals. The specific fluorogenic peptide (H-d) produces a high fluorescence signal. A calibration plot was obtained from the changes in the fluorescence intensity against the different concentrations of the viral protease. The lowest limit of detection of this method was 9.7  3 pfu/mL. The cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide was tested against the MERS-CoV which does not affect the fluorescence signal.

The aim of this study is to weigh the benefits of obtaining a VRP in patients presenting with isolated symptoms pertaining to well-defined criteria of an AECOPD with preexisting COPD or reactive airway disease to find out how such test impacts patient throughput time in the ED and also investigate how obtaining a VRP affects the use of antibiotics in this patient population. It is important that ED physicians accurately diagnose the main cause of AECOPD to help optimize the use of health care resources, including antibiotics, antivirals, inpatient, and ED beds. VRP testing must be taken into consideration as it helps eliminate the need of administering antibiotics to every patient who presents to the ED with AECOPD. Design and method This is a case-control observational study using retrospective chart review to obtain patients data from our hospital data warehouse. Data on patients with the primary diagnosis of AECOPD in the past two years were retrieved.

Among the 65 patients who received the VRP test, 45 (70%) had a virus etiology detected and reported in the ED (p=0.001). Also, 138 (50.2%) did not receive VRP test and were not given antibiotics, and 137 (49.8%) did not receive VRP test but were treated with antibiotics; 11 patients received antibiotics despite haven tested positive to a virus. The result showed that those who received antibiotics with no VRP test on arrival in the ED had a shorter throughput time compared to patients who did not receive antibiotics but received VRP test. Conclusion The study is a quality improvement study to help determine the efficacy and appropriateness of ordering a VRP prior to ED disposition and the impact of overall ED throughput time for each patient presenting with AECOPD. The study showed that antibiotics did play a significant role in the duration of the throughput time in patients with AECOPD. However, rapid VRP testing was indeed associated with a trend toward decreased antibiotic use in the ED.","output":"Evaluating the Benefits of Viral Respiratory Panel Test in the Reduction of Emergency Department Throughput Time for Patients With Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome-wide association analysis allows the identification of potential candidate genes involved in the development of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hence, it seems that genetics matters here, as well. Nevertheless, the virus's nature, including its RNA structure, determines the rate of mutations leading to new viral strains with all epidemiological and clinical consequences. Given these observations, we herein comment on the current hypotheses about the possible role of the genes in association with COVID-19 severity. We discuss some of the major candidate genes that have been identified as potential genetic factors associated with the COVID-19 severity and infection susceptibility: HLA, ABO, ACE2, TLR7, ApoE, TYK2, OAS, DPP9, IFNAR2, CCR2, etc. Further study of genes and genetic variants will be of great benefit for the prevention and assessment of the individual risk and disease severity in different populations.

A Venn diagram was generated to show the common targets of HFO and TM, and GO and KEGG analyses were performed to explore the potential biological processes and signaling pathways. The PPI network and core gene subnetwork were constructed using the STRING database and Cytoscape software. A molecular docking analysis was also conducted to simulate the combination of compounds and gene proteins. RESULTS: A total of 33 compounds and their related targets were obtained from the TCMSP database.

A previous phase I trial indicated that the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (V-01), which contains a fusion protein (IFN-PADRE-RBD-Fc dimer) as its antigen, is safe and well tolerated, capable of inducing rapid and robust immune responses, and warranted further testing in additional clinical trials. Herein, we aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of V-01, providing rationales of appropriate dose regimen for further efficacy study. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial was initiated at the Gaozhou Municipal Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangdong, China) in March 2021. Both younger (n = 440; 18C59 years of age) and older (n = 440; 60 years of age) adult participants in this trial were sequentially recruited into two distinct groups: two-dose regimen group in which participants were randomized either to follow a 10 or 25 g of V-01 or placebo given intramuscularly 21 days apart (allocation ratio, 3:3:1, n = 120, 120, 40 for each regimen, respectively), or one-dose regimen groups in which participants were randomized either to receive a single injection of 50 g of V-01 or placebo (allocation ratio, 3:1, n = 120, 40, respectively). The primary immunogenicity endpoints were the geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies against live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and specific binding antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The primary safety endpoint evaluation was the frequencies and percentages of overall adverse events (AEs) within 30 days after full immunization. RESULTS: V-01 provoked substantial immune responses in the two-dose group, achieving encouragingly high titers of neutralizing antibody and anti-RBD immunoglobulin, which peaked at day 35 (161.9 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 133.3C196.7] and 149.3 [95%CI: 123.9C179.9] in 10 and 25 g V-01 group of younger adults, respectively; 111.6 [95%CI: 89.6C139.1] and 111.1 [95%CI: 89.2C138.4] in 10 and 25 g V-01 group of older adults, respectively), and remained high at day 49 after a day-21 second dose; these levels significantly exceed those in convalescent serum from symptomatic COVID-19 patients (53.6, 95%CI: 31.3C91.7). Our preliminary data show that V-01 is safe and well tolerated, with reactogenicity predominantly being absent or mild in severity and only one vaccine-related grade 3 or worse AE being observed within 30 days. The older adult participants demonstrated a more favorable safety profile compared with those in the younger adult group: with AEs percentages of 19.2%, 25.8%, 17.5% in older adults vs. 34.2%, 23.3%, 26.7% in younger adults at the 10, 25 g V-01 two-dose group, and 50 g V-01 one-dose group, respectively.

Certain freshwater snail species are the intermediate host in the life cycle of schistosome species. Controlling snails employing molluscicides is an effective, quick, and convenient intervention strategy to prevent the spread of Schistosoma species in endemic regions. Advances have been made in developing both synthetic molluscicides and molluscicides derived from plants. However, at present, the development of molluscicides is not adapted to the actual demand for snails and schistosoma controlling. We undertake a systematic review of exploitation and application of synthetic molluscicides and molluscicides derived from plants to combat intermediate host snails. The detailed molluscicidal activity, structureCactivity relationship, structural feature, and possible mechanism of some molluscicides are also highlighted, which may afford an important reference for the design of new, more effective molluscicides with low environmental impact and realize the aim of controlling schistosome at transmission stages.

AIM: We aimed to review studies on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children during the early pandemic. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Europe PubMed Central and the preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv from 30 December 2019 to 10 August 2020. We assessed the quality of included studies using a series of questions adapted from related tools. We provide a narrative synthesis of the results. RESULTS: We identified 28 studies from 17 countries. Ten of 19 studies on household and close contact transmission reported low rates of child-to-adult or child-to-child transmission. Six studies investigated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in educational settings, with three studies reporting 183 cases from 14,003 close contacts who may have contracted COVID-19 from children index cases at their schools. Three mathematical modelling studies estimated that children were less likely to infect others than adults. All studies were of low to moderate quality. CONCLUSIONS: During the early pandemic, it appeared that children were not substantially contributing to household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. School-based studies indicated that transmission rates in this setting were low. Large-scale studies of transmission chains using data collected from contact tracing and serological studies detecting past evidence of infection would be needed to verify our findings.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children: a rapid review, 30 December 2019 to 10 August 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Sustaining a spinal cord injury (SCI) has been shown to impose a significant physical and psychological challenge with threat to quality of life (QOL). Duff & Kennedy provide a SCI explanation of appraisals and the two-stage process of an individuals primary assessment of their experience, and their secondary appraisal of their perceived coping resource being key facilitators of adjustment and fundamental to longer term adaptation. King & Kennedy designed a group coping effectiveness training (CET) intervention with a framework of coping strategy selection fit to reduce use of threat appraisals/avoidance coping, and to promote development of challenge appraisals with consequent stress reduction and adjustment. CASE PRESENTATION: This CET approach was applied within individual psychological therapy with a 74-year old woman who presented with symptoms of anxiety, reactivated PTSD, mood disturbance and difficulty adjusting after sustaining SCI. Psychological adjustment treatment enabled resolution of post-trauma symptoms, re-evaluation of appraisals and perceived loss of identity, and development of positive coping strategies, and promoted a new conceptualisation of independence. DISCUSSION: Case studies of psychological treatment are rare within the SCI literature. This paper provides a detailed application of primary appraisals and coping strategy selection fit in individual therapy. Attention is drawn to the important impact appraisals have on long-term rehabilitation outcomes and the necessity of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) approach to achieve optimal psychological and physical adjustment following SCI. Finally, the paper highlights the need for community education to reduce negative perceptions/taboo of disability.","output":"Regaining A Sense Of Me: a single case study of SCI adjustment, applying the appraisal model and coping effectiveness training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In February 2020, Italy became the epicenter for COVID-19 in Europe, and at the beginning of March, the Italian Government put in place emergency measures to restrict population movement.

We used a Susceptible-Infectious stochastic model and we estimated a municipality-specific infection contact rate () to capture the susceptibility to the disease. We identified in Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions (52% of all Italian cases) significant clusters of high , due to the simultaneous presence of connections between municipalities and high population density. Local simulated spreading in regions, with different levels of infection observed, showed different disease geographical patterns due to different values and commuting systems. In addition, we produced a vulnerability map (in the Abruzzi region as an example) by simulating the epidemic considering each municipality as a seed. The result shows the highest vulnerability values in areas with commercial hubs, close to the highest populated cities and the most industrial area.

FMF treatment goals according to EULAR are to control acute attacks and subclinical inflammation and to improve patients quality of life1. In a phase 3 pivotal study (CLUSTER study), FMF patients treated with the interleukin-1 inhibitor canakinumab met all these goals2.Objectives:The present study explores the long-term efficacy and safety of canakinumab (CAN) in routine clinical practice in pediatric (age 2 years) and adult FMF patients.Methods:RELIANCE is a prospective, non-interventional, multi-center, observational study based in Germany with a three-year follow-up period. Patients with clinically confirmed diagnosis of FMF who routinely receive CAN were enrolled in order to evaluate effectiveness and safety of CAN under standard clinical practice conditions. Disease activity and remission by physicians assessment, disease activity, fatigue and impact on social life by patients assessment, inflammatory markers and AIDAI (Auto-Inflammatory Diseases Activity Index) score were recorded at baseline and were assessed at 6-monthly intervals within the three-year observation period of the study.Results:This interim analysis of FMF patients (N=54) enrolled by December 2020 includes baseline as well as 6-, 12- and 18-month data. Mean age in this cohort was 25 years (4?56 years) and the proportion of female patients was 46 % (N=25). At baseline, median duration of prior CAN treatment was 2.0 years (0?6 years).While physician ratings report around 62% of patients in disease remission, 52% with absent and 34% with mild-moderate disease activity, patient-reported disease activity decreased from moderate (PPA 3.0) to low (PPA 2.0) during the observation period. A decrease was observed regarding disease activity parameters, in particular in patients without prior CAN therapy (Table 1, Figure 1). A total of 11 serious adverse events was reported, of which one case of tonsillectomy was classified as drug-related.Conclusion:Interim data of FMF patients from the RELIANCE study, the longest running real-life CAN registry, confirm efficacy and safety of long-term CAN treatment.References:[1]Ozen S, et al.

As early as 2012, Taiwan has released indoor air quality standards, and in 2017 announced the second batch of places that should meet indoor air quality standards including sports and fitness places. In this study, the indoor air quality was monitored in the indoor exercise and fitness center under normal operating conditions of air conditioning and ventilation as well as user flow. Chlorine dioxide and weak acid hypochlorite solutions, and water scrubbing were used to improve the quality of the indoor environment under different operating modes. This study investigated the air quality improvement in terms of bacteria and fungi contamination of the indoor exercise and fitness center under normal operating conditions including air conditioning, ventilation, and user flow. In addition, bacteria contamination and disinfection on sports equipment surface were also examined. Background bacteria and fungi densities in bioaerosols were in the range of 249  65 to 812  111 CFU/m 3 and 226  39 to 837  838 CFU/m 3 in the indoor air of the fitness center and 370  86 to 953  136 CFU/m 3 and 465  108 to 1,734  580 CFU/m 3 in the outdoor air, respectively. Chlorine dioxide and weak acid hypochlorous water aerosols could remove both bacteria and fungi much better than water scrubbing. Contact time of 15 minutes was sufficient to control both bacteria and fungi to comply with the official air quality standards. User density and carbon dioxide deteriorated both bacteria and fungi disinfection performance whereas temperature was only statistically significant on fungi disinfection. Other factors including relative humidity, airflow velocity, and particulate matters did not have any statistically significant effect on microbial inactivation. Handle of bicycle, dumbbell, and sit-up bench were found to be contaminated with bacteria and E. coli . Detected densities for bacteria and E. coli on the surface of these sport equipment were in the range of 390  2 to 3,720  736 CFU/cm 2 and 550  70 to 1,080  114 CFU/cm 2 , respectively. Microbial densities detected largely depended on the number of users for each specific equipment. Chlorine dioxide and zinc oxide were noticeably better than weak acid hypochlorous water and commercial disinfectant in term of bacteria inactivation whereas all tested disinfectants had comparable effectiveness on E. coli disinfection.

HCWs play a vital role in the global health care system, with the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrating their effectiveness and worth beyond any doubt. However, HCWs are among the most vulnerable members of the health care system because they are most susceptible to stress, exhaustion, and occupational health risks. Method: The review was conducted in 2021 and included articles published in English in the past five years that explore diabetic HCWs QoL and studies intended to assess the relationship between work stress and DM. In total, 27 relevant articles were found that satisfied the inclusion criteria and were critically and thematically analyzed. Results: Most DM studies have focused on the clinical management of patients, but researchers have paid little attention to the high-risk group of HCWs with diabetes. In addition to fulfilling their job mandate, HCWs are burdened with various sociological stressors that affect their QoL. Conclusion: This literature review suggests DM has a significant impact on QoL in the workClife context. However, there is limited evidence to demonstrate the impact of DM on the QoL of HCWs.

Infected cell types were identified by double immunofluorescent labeling of specific cell markers and viral antigens. All viral strains studied produced infection in astrocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Neurons were not infected by CDV A75C17 but were rapidly infected by CDV\\\\SH and CDV\\\\RO. Multipolar oligodendrocytes were very rarely infected by any of the virus strains. In contrast, a morphologically distinct subset of bipolar oligodendrocytes were commonly infected by CDV\\\\SH and CDV\\\\RO. The kinetics of infection in the astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and macrophages varied between strains. Both CDV\\\\SH and CDV\\\\RO rapidly infected bipolar oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, neurons, and macrophages by 14 days post infection while infection by CDV A75C17 was delayed until after 28C35 days post infection. The differences in the growth kinetics and cell tropisms for some brain cells, exhibited by the three viral strains examined in this in vitro study, may relate to the different CNS symptoms that these strains produce in vivo.","output":"Virulent and attenuated canine distemper virus infects multiple dog brain cell types in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lifts in 4x4 cars, on-site accommodation and home working are included in plans to keep nurses working in extreme weather during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Trusts reveal emergency travel plans for healthcare staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Avian cryptosporidiosis is a common parasitic disease that is caused by five species, which are well characterised at the molecular and biological level, and more than 18 genotypes for which we have limited information In this study, we determined the occurrence and molecular characteristics of Cryptosporidium spp in farmed ostriches in the Czech Republic METHODS: The occurrence and genetic identity of Cryptosporidium spp were analysed by microscopy and PCR/sequencing of the small subunit rRNA, actin, HSP70 and gp60 genes Cryptosporidium avian genotype II was examined from naturally and experimentally infected hosts and measured using differential interference contrast The localisation of the life-cycle stages was studied by electron microscopy and histologically Infectivity of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II for cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus (Kerr)), chickens (Gallus gallus f domestica (L )), geese (Anser anser f domestica (L )), SCID and BALB/c mice (Mus musculus L ) was verified RESULTS: A total of 204 individual faecal samples were examined for Cryptosporidium spp using differential staining and PCR/sequencing Phylogenetic analysis of small subunit rRNA, actin, HSP70 and gp60 gene sequences showed the presence of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II (n = 7) and C ubiquitum Fayer, Santn &amp;Macarisin, 2010 IXa (n = 5) Only ostriches infected with Cryptosporidium avian genotype II shed oocysts that were detectable by microscopy Oocysts were purified from a pooled sample of four birds, characterised morphometrically and used in experimental infections to determine biological characteristics Oocysts of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II measure on average 6 13  5 15 m, and are indistinguishable by size from C baileyi Current, Upton &amp;Haynes, 1986 and C avium Holubov, Sak, Horcickov, Hlskov, Kvetonov, Menchaca, McEvoy &amp;Kvc, 2016 Cryptosporidium avian genotype II was experimentally infectious for geese, chickens and cockatiels, with a prepatent period of four, seven and eight days post-infection, respectively The infection intensity ranged from 1000 to 16,000 oocysts per gram None of the naturally or experimentally infected birds developed clinical signs in the present study CONCLUSIONS: The molecular and biological characteristics of Cryptosporidium avian genotype II, described here, support the establishment of a new species, Cryptosporidium ornithophilus n sp","output":"Description of Cryptosporidium ornithophilus n. sp.

These include their utility for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, past infection or exposure, correlation with immunity and the effective duration of immunity. This study examined the performance of three laboratory based serological assays, EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, MAGLUMI 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM/IgG and EDI Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG immunoassays. We evaluated 138 samples from a reference non-infected population and 71 samples from a cohort of 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive by RT-PCR. The samples were collected at various intervals of 0-45 days post symptoms onset (PSO). Specificity and sensitivity of these assays was 60.9%/71.4% (IgA) and 94.2%/63.3% (IgG) for EUROIMMUN; 98.5%/18.4% (IgM) and 97.8%/53.1% (IgG) for MAGLUMI; and 94.9%/22.5% (IgM) and 93.5%/57.1% (IgG) for EDI, respectively. When samples collected &#8805;14 days PSO were considered, the sensitivities were 100.0 and 100.0%; 31.0 and 82.8%; 34.5 and 57.1%, respectively. Using estimated population prevalence of 0.1, 1, and 10%, the positive predictive value of all assays remained low. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA lacked specificity for acute diagnosis and all IgM assays offered poor diagnostic utility. Seroconversion can be delayed although all patients had seroconverted at 28 days in our cohort with the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Despite this, with specificity of only 94% this assay would not be satisfactory for seroprevalence studies in the general Australian population given this is likely to be currently <1%.","output":"Comparative analysis of three laboratory based serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 in an Australian cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The vast majority of people worldwide have been impacted by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In addition to the millions of individuals who have been infected with the disease, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggests that this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes; however, researchers are rarely able to track these changes with frequent, near-real-time sampling or compare their findings to previous years of data for the same individuals. OBJECTIVE: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students who have been participating in a longitudinal study for the past 2 years, we sought to answer two overarching questions. First, have the behaviors and mental health of the participants changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous time periods? Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media? METHODS: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models. RESULTS: During the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19Crelated news. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P=.03) were significantly associated with COVID-19Crelated news. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.","output":"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease is a pandemic that has infected millions of people around the world. Lung CT-scans are effective diagnostic tools, but radiologists can quickly become overwhelmed by the flow of infected patients. Therefore, automated image interpretation needs to be achieved. Deep learning (DL) can support critical medical tasks including diagnostics, and DL algorithms have successfully been applied to the classification and detection of many diseases. This work aims to use deep learning methods that can classify patients between Covid-19 positive and healthy patient. We collected 4 available datasets, and tested our convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different distributions to investigate the generalizability of our models. In order to clearly explain the predictions, Grad-CAM and Fast-CAM visualization methods were used. Our approach reaches more than 92% accuracy on 2 different distributions.

Our results show that almost half of the volatility of changes in total inflation is explained by changes in oil price. As could be expected, the energy component of inflation drives this effect.

The analysis of biological material for trace concentrations of zinc and copper was carried out with the use of ultrasensitive triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (TQ ICP-MS). The obtained results prove that the concentration of copper in the test group was lower than in the control group. For the zinc concentrations, the inverse relationship was observed. The group of patients was characterized by a higher concentration of this element than the group of healthy volunteers.

CASE PRESENTATION: The case is an 18-month-old child with fever and diarrhoea from 3 days before, who did not respond to outpatient treatment. On the day of the visit, he suffered from deep and abdominal breathing and decreased level of consciousness and sugar levels at admission of 420 mg/dl. He was then admitted with the initial diagnosis of DKA and had a positive PCR test result for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the non-specific symptoms of COVID-19, general practitioners and paediatricians are recommended that special attention be paid to these symptoms, especially those that are similar to life-threatening syndromes.

METHODS A keyword search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published until November, 2019. Two investigators screened the articles and extract data from each included study. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the effect of BW on stroke. In addition, the quality of evidence was evaluated by GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation; version:3.6) approach. RESULTS A total of ten studies were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the review. All included studies described some positive influences of BW on stroke relative to the control group (forward walking or conventional treatment).

However, the limited analytical accuracy of previously bioanalytical methods for teicoplanin has given rise to uncertainty due to the use of an external standard. In this study, an internal standard (IS), polymyxin B, was applied to devise a precise, accurate, and feasible HPLC-UV method. The deproteinized plasma sample containing teicoplanin and an IS of acetonitrile was chromatographed on a C18 column with an acidic mobile phase consisting of NaH(2)PO(4) buffer and acetonitrile (78:22, v/v) by isocratic elution and detection at 220 nm. The linearity was in the range 7.8C500 mg/L calculated by the ratio of the teicoplanin signal to the IS signal.

In particular, there are no extant high-resolution imaging studies on genetic covariance. In this article, we describe a novel method that combines classical quantitative genetic methodologies for variance decomposition with recently developed semi-multivariate algorithms for high-resolution measurement of phenotypic covariance. Using these tools, we produced correlational maps of genetic and environmental (i.e. nongenetic) relationships between several regions of interest and the cortical surface in a large pediatric sample of 600 twins, siblings, and singletons. These analyses demonstrated high, fairly uniform, statistically significant genetic correlations between the entire cortex and global mean cortical thickness. In agreement with prior reports on phenotypic covariance using similar methods, we found that mean cortical thickness was most strongly correlated with association cortices. However, the present study suggests that genetics plays a large role in global brain patterning of cortical thickness in this manner. Further, using specific gyri with known high heritabilities as seed regions, we found a consistent pattern of high bilateral genetic correlations between structural homologues, with environmental correlations more restricted to the same hemisphere as the seed region, suggesting that interhemispheric covariance is largely genetically mediated. These findings are consistent with the limited existing knowledge on the genetics of cortical variability as well as our prior multivariate studies on cortical gyri.","output":"Variance decomposition of MRI-based covariance maps using genetically informative samples and structural equation modeling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While in the past the concept of resilience was used to explain psychological well-being in extreme situations like enduring poverty, abuse, or war, it has now found broad application in numerous fields of research.

This raises the question of whether resilience and academic success are correlated. Using German longitudinal data including university and university of applied sciences students in their first four years (2010C2015) we investigate how resilience and various measurements of success (satisfaction, intention to drop out, grades) are correlated using multilevel growth-curve models. We demonstrate that resilient individuals have consistently more positive academic trajectories, have lower dropout intentions, report better grades and are more satisfied with their lives. The effects are exceptionally stable over time, statistically highly significant and of considerable magnitude.

Due to low incidence, an individual randomized controlled trial (RCT) is underpowered to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccines increase the risks of thromboembolism and hemorrhage. METHODS: We performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, medRxiv databases, and reference lists of relevant articles to identify RCTs that reported thromboembolic, hemorrhagic events, and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled thromboembolic risk related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines compared to placebo. The secondary outcomes included estimating the risks of arterial thromboembolism (ATE), venous thromboembolisms (VTE), hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death. RESULTS: Eight RCTs of 4 vaccine platforms comprised of 195,196 participants were retrieved. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were not associated with an increased risk of overall thromboembolism (risk ratio [RR], 1.14; 95% CI [confidence interval], 0.61C2.14; I(2) = 35%), ATE (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.46C2.06; I(2) = 21%), VTE (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.72C2.99; I(2) = 0%), hemorrhage (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.35C2.68; I(2) = 0), and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.16C1.79; I(2) = 0). Compared to the baseline estimated risk of these outcomes in participants administered placebos, the risk differences with vaccines were very small and not statistically significant.

The objective of this study was to assess a cohort of Ecuadorian healthcare workers for adverse reactions following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. METHODS: We conducted an observational cross-sectional study to assess the potential adverse reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine among a sample of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, from March to May 2021. RESULTS: The sample comprised 1291 patients, with a mean age of 39.3 years (SD, 13.5). In general, 79% (N = 1020) of participants presented an adverse effect of any type at first dose, while 75.1% (N = 969) did so at the second dose. Pain at the puncture site was the most common adverse effect overall after either the first (68.4%) and second (55.6%) dose. Regarding anaphylaxis, no participant developed the condition after the first dose, and only 0.2% (N = 2) developing it at the second dose. No fatalities were reported. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that adverse reactions following COVID-19 vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are relatively common, albeit often mild and self-limited. Consistent with the literature there were few cases of anaphylaxis, and no deaths that could be attributed to the inoculation with the vaccine.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 293 students was undertaken on 13 May 2020. Survey questions addressed demographics, knowledge of the disease and effectiveness of the protective measures, risk perception, socio-cognitive perceptions (e.g. attitude, social support, and self-efficacy), habit, time factors and trust, as well as the hand hygiene and social distancing behaviours. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the strongest associations of potential determinants with behaviour. RESULTS: Participants reported high levels of social distancing with 88.9% answering \\"Mostly\\" or \\"Always\\" for every activity, but only 42.0% reporting the same for all hand hygiene activities. Knowledge of the effectiveness of each activity in preventing transmission was high, with 90.7% and 93.5% respectively identifying at least 7 of 8 hand hygiene or 9 of 10 social distancing activities correctly. Habit (? = 0.39, p = 0.001) and time factors (? = 0.28, p = 0.001) were the greatest contributors to unique variance in hand hygiene behaviour, followed by ethnicity (? = - 0.13, p = 0.014) and risk perception (? = 0.13, p = 0.016). For social distancing behaviour, the determinants were self-efficacy (? = 0.25, p < 0.001), perceived advantages (? = 0.15, p = 0.022), trust in policy (? = 0.14, p = 0.026) and gender (? = - 0.14, p = 0.016). Regression models explained 40% hand hygiene and 25% social distancing variance. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that communications about effectiveness of hand hygiene and social distancing behaviours had been effective in terms of knowledge acquisition. However, in the light of likely second waves of COVID-19, attention to maintaining social distancing behaviour and improving hand hygiene behaviour may need to address more difficult areas of changing habits, overcoming time factors and building trust, as well as interventions to increase self-efficacy and address risk perception concerns.","output":"Knowledge, socio-cognitive perceptions and the practice of hand hygiene and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study of UK university students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] A coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading widely through person-to-person transmission.

However, there have only been a few reports on the detection of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the primer-independent RNA-replicable protein produced by the RNA genes of coronavirus. Here, we introduce a novel diagnostic methodology for COVID-19 using the RNA-directed and de novo RNA replicable function of RdRP. We devised an RNA platform for RdRP-induced transcription (RPRIT) that includes an RNA template that can be directly transcribed by RdRP. By utilizing RPRIT, the presence of RdRP can be readily confirmed within 30 min using isothermal incubation without PCR. This RdRP detection method can provide a new route for rapid diagnosis of RNA virus-infected patients.","output":"Rapid Diagnosis of Coronavirus by RNA-Directed RNA Transcription Using an Engineered RNA-based Platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 threatens human health, and the mortality rate is higher in patients who develop myocardial damage.

Based on the rapid development of nanomaterials and nano-devices, more and more phenomena occur on the nanoscale devices in the field of thermology, optics, mechanics, etc. Recently, we experimentally observed a novel ion transport phenomenon in nanostructured graphene oxide membrane (GOM) under asymmetric illumination. We first build a light-induced carriers diffusion model based on our previous experimental results. This model can reveal the light-induced ion transport mechanism and predict the carriers diffusion behavior under different operational situations and material characters. The voltage difference increases with the rise of illuminate asymmetry, photoresponsivity, recombination coefficient, and carriers diffusion coefficient ratio. Finally, we discuss the ion transport behavior with different surface charge densities using MD simulation. Moderate surface charge decreases the ion transport with the same type of charge due to the electrostatic repulsion; however, excess surface charge blocks both cation and anion because a thicker electrical double layer decreases effective channel height. Research here provides referenced operational and material conditions to obtain a greater voltage difference between the membrane sides. Also, the mechanism of ion transport and ion sieving can guide us to modify membrane material according to different aims.","output":"Ionic Transport Triggered by Asymmetric Illumination on 2D Nano-Membrane"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inactivated Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been used in many countries. However, its immunogenicity profile in immunosuppressed dermatological patients is lacking. This prospective observational case-control study compared the humoral immune response between adult dermatological patients receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapies (n = 14) and those who did not (n = 18); excluding patients with HIV infection, cancer, non-dermatological autoimmune conditions, previous COVID-19 infection, and positive anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG prior to vaccination. The subjects were advised to withhold methotrexate for 1 week after each vaccine dose while continuing other therapies unadjusted. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody, surrogate neutralizing antibody (sNAb), and seroconversion rates (calculated from the percentages of participants in the group with positive sNAb) were used to assess immunogenicity. We found that participants using azathioprine, cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, or prednisolone  10 mg/day had a lower level of serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody and sNAb than those received methotrexate  10 mg/week, prednisolone < 10 mg/day, or biologics (i.e., secukinumab, ixekizumab, omalizumab). Patients who received methotrexate  10 mg/week, prednisolone < 10 mg/day or the biologics had a similar immunogenicity profile to those without immunosuppressive therapies. Despite the lack of statistical significance, a reduction of humoral immune response was observed among the study participants who used 2 immunosuppressants or pemphigus patients. Our findings suggest that a subset of patients with immune-mediated skin conditions respond poorly to the vaccine despite having low-level immunosuppression.

This would reduce animal stress during experimental assays and assist in the development of a screening method for the identification of fever in animals suspected of being infected with BTV. Rectal and infrared eye temperatures were collected before and after BTV inoculation. The two temperature measures were positively correlated (r = 0.504, P < 0.05). The highest correlation between rectal and infrared temperatures was observed when temperatures were above physiological levels. IRT discriminated between febrile and non-febrile sheep with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97%. The results showed that eye temperature measured using IRT was a useful non-invasive method for the assessment of fever in sheep infected with BTV under experimental conditions.

COVID-19's sudden arrival wreaked havoc on the world economic picture, particularly in the energy sector. A steep drop in oil prices, as well as an imbalance in energy, was the result of strict travel restrictions, fewer transportation options, and people's fears of a flu pandemic. However, confined mobility and a drop in energy demand coated the environment with a silver line and drowned the nation's economic opportunities.

With interferon alpha-based therapy, SVR was linked to improved PH and fibrosis regression. SVR to oral antiviral regimens is linked to reduced portal pressure in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) at baseline. However, CSPH continues in most of the patients. This study aims to assess the reversibility and/or improvement of PH in Egyptian patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and CSPH after achieving SVR with DAAs. The second aim is to evaluate performance of the noninvasive markers of fibrosis in prediction of the presence and/or reversibility of the CSPH in correlation to radiological and endoscopic parameters. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We evaluated noninvasive parameters, radiological and endoscopic signs of PH at baseline, and/or SVR 24 and SVR 48 post-DAA therapy in 40 patients with cirrhosis and CSPH (group A) and another 40 patients with cirrhosis only (group B). RESULTS: In group A, the spleen diameter decreased from baseline (15.74  1.53 cm), and SVR 24 (15.48  1.51), to SVR 48 (15.35  1.49 cm). No ascites detected at SVR 48 in 62.5%. Portal vein diameter and portal vein blood velocity reduced to 13.53  1.07 mm and 14.14  2.2 cm/s at SVR 48, with reversibility of hepatic vein waveform towards the triphasic pattern. Medium to large esophageal varices regressed from 52.5% to 2.5%, and up to 70% of patients showed no EVs at SVR 48. In group A, 24 patients showed complete reversibility of CSPH, and 16 patients showed improvement of CSPH. Child-Pugh score, FIB-4 index, Kings score, and Lok index revealed higher significance for detection of the presence of PH. Child-Pugh score, PC/SD ratio, and Lok index revealed higher significance for detection of reversibility of PH. CONCLUSION: We concluded that CSPH improved after SVR with DAAs and completely regressed in some patients. Upon predicting the presence of PH, Child-Pugh score, FIB-4 index, Kings score, and Lok index were the most significant noninvasive scores. While for predicting the reversibility of PH, Child-Pugh score, PC/SD ratio, and Lok index were the most significant scores.","output":"Impact of sustained virologic response in regression of portal hypertension in Egyptian patients with hepatitis C virus-associated cirrhosis and portal hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposes a novel approach to explore the design space of Power Domain (PD) partitioning in the architecture definition phase of heterogeneous SoCs.

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 48 patients with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 infection who had undergone CT-PE between March 23 and April 6, 2020, in a large urban health care system were included. Patient demographics and clinical data were collected through the electronic medical record system. Twenty-five patients underwent dual-energy CT (DECT) as part of the standard CT-PE protocol at a subset of the hospitals. Two thoracic radiologists independently assessed all studies. Disagreement in assessment was resolved by consensus discussion with a third thoracic radiologist. Results: Of the 48 patients, 45 patients required admission, with 18 admitted to the intensive care unit, and 13 requiring intubation. Seven patients (15%) were found to have pulmonary emboli. Dilated vessels were seen in 41 cases (85%), with 38 (78%) and 27 (55%) cases demonstrating vessel enlargement within and outside of lung opacities, respectively. Dilated distal vessels extending to the pleura and fissures were seen in 40 cases (82%) and 30 cases (61%), respectively. At DECT, mosaic perfusion pattern was observed in 24 cases (96%), regional hyperemia overlapping with areas of pulmonary opacities or immediately surrounding the opacities were seen in 13 cases (52%), opacities associated with corresponding oligemia were seen in 24 cases (96%), and hyperemic halo was seen in 9 cases (36%). Conclusion: Pulmonary vascular abnormalities such as vessel enlargement and regional mosaic perfusion patterns are common in COVID-19 pneumonia.

Cerebral oximetry is a non-invasive method to detect imbalances in the cerebral oxygen supply/demand-ratio. Low preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO?) levels have been associated with postoperative delirium in non-cardiac surgery patients. The present prospective observational study determines the relationship between pre- and intra-operative ScO? levels and postoperative delirium in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery. METHODS After approval of the local ethical committee and written informed consent, N = 231 patients scheduled for elective/urgent cardiac surgery were enrolled. Delirium was assessed by the confusion-assessment-method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) on the first three days after surgery. ScO? was obtained on the day before surgery, immediately before surgery and throughout the surgical procedure. Preoperative cognitive function, demographic, surgery related, and intra- and post-operative physiological data were registered. RESULTS Patients with delirium had lower pre- and intra-operative ScO? readings, were older, had lower mini-mental-status-examination(MMSE) scores, higher additive EuroScore and lower preoperative haemoglobin-levels.

METHODS WN or fluoxetine (as positive control drug) was administered to wild-type (N2) and knockout C. elegans strains (AQ866, DA1814, DA2100, DA2109, and MT9772) to determine their effect on oxidative stress (Trolox, H2DCFDA, and juglone assays) on osmotic stress and heat stress and lifespan. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was applied to investigate the effect of WN or fluoxetine on the expression of serotonin receptors (ser-1, ser-4, ser-7) and serotonin transporter (mod-5). The binding affinity of WN to serotonin receptors and transporter was analyzed in silico using AutoDock 4.2.6. RESULTS WN scavenged ROS in wild-type and knockout C. elegans and prolonged their lifespan. WN upregulated the expression of serotonin receptor and transporter genes.

In California, legislation has been proposed which supporters claim will help these struggling recording artists by strengthening their position in negotiations with record labels. Economic analysis suggests otherwise. California Assembly Bill AB-1385 makes contracts between labels and recording artists nearly unenforceable, reducing the incentive for record labels to invest in recording artistsespecially for new recording artists and recording artists serving less-popular genresthus reducing recording artists income. Statutory limits on the exercise of options likewise reduce recording artists income. We expect AB-1385, if passed, to lead to a sizable contraction in the music business in California, as both record labels and recording artists are incented move to states where meaningful, voluntary contracts may be crafted and enforced.","output":"The Day the Music Died (in California): An Analysis of California Assembly Bill AB-1385"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports indicate an increased risk of ischemic stroke during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We aimed to identify patients with COVID-19 and ischemic stroke and explore markers of inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endotheliopathy, a structural and functional disturbance of the vascular endothelium due to a stressor. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study comparing acute ischemic stroke patients with and without COVID-19 across 3 hospitals. Timing of stroke onset during COVID-19 course and markers of inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial activation were evaluated by COVID-19 status and stroke cause. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with ischemic stroke were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Patients with COVID-19 had a similar age and burden of vascular risk factors compared with the control cohort (n=168). We identified a temporal correlation between stroke onset and the peak of acute phase reactants, including CRP (C-reactive protein), ferritin, and d-dimer. In subsets of patients with labs available, embolic stroke of undetermined source was associated with elevated IL (interleukin)-6 (median, 171 [interquartile range, 13C375] versus 8 [4C11], P<0.01) and sIL (soluble IL)-2 receptor (1972 [1525C4720] versus 767 [563C1408.5], P=0.05) levels. Stroke patients with COVID-19 demonstrated elevated levels of endothelial activation markers compared with non-COVID-19 stroke controls (median von Willebrand activity 285.0% [interquartile range, 234%C382%] versus 150% [128%C183%], P=0.034; von Willebrand antigen 330.0% [265%C650%] versus 152% [130%C277%], P=0.007, and factor VIII 301% [289%C402%] versus 49% [26%C94%], P<0.001).

This disease can impact the cardiovascular system and lead to abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. Emergency clinicians must be aware of the ECG manifestations of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review outlines the pathophysiology and electrocardiographic findings associated with COVID-19. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is a potentially critical illness associated with a variety of ECG abnormalities, with up to 90% of critically ill patients demonstrating at least one abnormality. The ECG abnormalities in COVID-19 may be due to cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, electrolyte abnormalities, plaque rupture, coronary spasm, microthrombi, or direct endothelial or myocardial injury. While sinus tachycardia is the most common abnormality, others include supraventricular tachycardias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, various bradycardias, interval and axis changes, and ST segment and T wave changes. Several ECG presentations are associated with poor outcome, including atrial fibrillation, QT interval prolongation, ST segment and T wave changes, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes the relevant ECG findings associated with COVID-19. Knowledge of these findings in COVID-19-related electrocardiographic presentations may assist emergency clinicians in the evaluation and management of potentially infected and infected patients.","output":"Electrocardiographic manifestations of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various processes in academic organizations include the decision points where selecting people through their assessment and ranking is performed, and the impact of wrong or right choices can be very high.

A total of 865 specimens collected prospectively and retrospectively were included, and discordant results were further examined using another commercial product, R-GENE(?) respiratory kits (bioMrieux, Marcy lEtoile, France). There was high agreement between both methods, with 98.6% concordance and a kappa (k) value of 0.9 (95% CI: 0.89C0.92). A specific analysis of both methods for each viral agent demonstrated comparable sensitivity and specificity, both ranging from 0.83 to 1 with good predictive values for the prospective part of the study. Good agreement between both methods was also found for the  values obtained (ranging from 97.55% to 98.9%), with the lowest for hMPV (k = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75C0.91) and RV (k = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.65C0.81).

Among the various urban systems, transportation services were among those that suffered the most significant impacts, particularly severe in the case of highways. This paper addresses the challenges and responses to the pandemic from a private highway operators perspective and from a multidisciplinary perspective. Highway operators faced two main challenges: on one hand, the need to cope with the potential disruption caused by the pandemic and a national lockdown for almost three months, the provision of road services, and the requirement to ensure the proper operation and maintenance, and on the other hand, the strong negative impact of the pandemic on levels of traffic. Our case study shows that the operators management response in question is essentially characterised by being a first response to short term impacts while balancing for workers health and safety, engineering and management, internal business management, and overall economic impact. Highway operators were hardly prepared for such an event and became more focused on prioritising their employees and clients safety to avoid service disruption. Regarding levels of traffic, the pandemic has had severe effects, although to a varying degree, depending on the different types of vehicles (heavy, light, passenger, freight, among other types of vehicles) and the location of highways (coastal vs. interior). The lessons learnt can be valuable in future disruptive events and for other highway concession operators.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Highway Traffic and Management: The Case Study of an Operator Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue is a serious tropical disease caused by the mosquito-borne dengue virus (DENV).

Most research projects and clinical trials were temporarily stopped or postponed. The Resident and Research Fellow Section (RRFS) of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) has decided to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurology training. METHODS: All EAN RRFS members were invited to fill out an online questionnaire of 40 items concerning their clinical involvement during the COVID-19 emergency, and the impact of the pandemic on their training (Appendix S1). RESULTS: Of the 227 RRFS members who completed the questionnaire, 222 were from Europe, and of those 111 were from Portugal, Italy or France. Responders highlighted that severe restrictions have been imposed to face this pandemic, including reduction of inpatient beds, prohibition of in-person visits and limitation to hospital access for patients' relatives. This was accompanied by an increase in email correspondence and phone calls with 50% of countries allowing telemedicine to reach outpatients. Seventy-nine per cent of the respondents felt that the pandemic will probably have a serious impact on their training and career. CONCLUSION: The pandemic led to a disruption of neurology activities, including medical training and research. The long-run impact of these changes remains unknown, but it will probably change the way neurology practice and training will be organized for future generations.","output":"Neurology training and research in the COVID-19 pandemic: a survey of the Resident and Research Fellow Section of the European Academy of Neurology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both bottom-up and top-down planning is needed to prevent a global economic disaster.

METHODS We conducted a quality-improvement initiative from May 28-June 25, 2020, during the first 4 weeks of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in the Barnes-Jewish Hospital labor and delivery unit. All consecutive patients presenting for delivery without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms were offered testing over four 1-week phases. Phase I documented the rate of testing uptake. Phase II recorded patients' reasons for declining testing. Phase III used phase II findings to create and implement shared decision-making tools. Phase IV offered each patient who declined nasopharyngeal testing an oropharyngeal alternative. The primary outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake by phase. RESULTS Of 270 patients, 223 (83%) accepted testing and 47 (17%) declined. Maternal age and mode of delivery were similar between groups, whereas testing uptake was higher among nulliparous, White, Hispanic, or privately insured patients. There was a significant increase in the primary outcome of SARS-CoV-2 testing across phases I-IV, from 68% to 76% to 94% to 95%, respectively (Somers' D 0.45; 95% CI of association 0.30-0.59). The most commonly cited reason for declining testing was concern regarding testing discomfort. In subgroup analyses by race and insurance type, there was a significant increase in testing uptake across phases I-IV for Black patients (56%, 54%, 91%, 92%; Somers' D 0.36; 95% CI of association 0.28-0.64), White patients (76%, 93%, 96%, 100%; Somers' D 0.59; 95% CI of association 0.38-0.8), those with Medicaid insurance (60%, 64%, 88%, 92%; 95%; Somers' D 0.39; CI of association 0.22 to 0.56), and those with private insurance (77%, 96%, 97%, 100%; Somers' D 0.63; 95% CI of association 0.40-0.86).

A quantitative synthesis of existing studies is lacking. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the prevalence rates for mental disorders among adults with a foster or residential child welfare or juvenile justice care history, comparing them where possible to rates among the general population. PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched for epidemiological studies published up to 28 October 2020. Nineteen studies, totaling 604,257 participants, met our inclusion criteria. Random-effects models were used for prevalence rates and odds ratios (OR) of mental disorders, and study quality was rated. A prevalence rate of 30% [95% CI (23.36, 37.36)] for any mental disorder in adults with a child welfare care history was found (3-17% for specific disorders). A prevalence rate of 45% [95% CI (42.38, 47.38)] for any mental disorder was found in adults with a juvenile justice care history (6-66% for specific disorders). For out-of-home placement history, adult mental disorders were significantly higher than in the general population (OR = 1.33-2.76). Studies differed in terms of methodology and the disorder groups considered, so heterogeneity between effect sizes ranged from low to high. Our findings suggest that the high risk that mental health issues will persist in adults with an out-of-home placement history needs to be taken seriously in the transition from adolescence to adulthood.

METHODS: Human pooled microsomes, supersomes, and cryopreserved human hepatocytes were used to monitor DDIs in vitro. RED (Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis) protein binding was employed to investigate other pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Gefitinib is significantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP3A4, with less than 80% of the drug remaining. Erlotinib is significantly metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2. Although gefitinib and erlotinib were metabolized by the same CYP isoenzymes, the metabolites formed from degradation of the two drugs were different. Fluoxetine inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 metabolism of gefitinib with an IC(50) of 65.12  1.88 M and 4.11  2.26 M, respectively. Fluoxetine also inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 metabolism of erlotinib with an IC(50) of 7.06  1.54 M and 4.57  1.22 M, respectively. For hepatocytes, fluoxetine affected the metabolism of gefitinib or erlotinib, while losartan had no effect. Gefitinib and erlotinib inhibited the metabolism of fluoxetine and losartan. Two-drug combinations involving gefitinib or erlotinib with fluoxetine or losartan yielded insignificant (p-value  0.05) differences in metabolism. However, combinations involving three drugs yielded significant degrees of inhibition (p-value  0.05). Three drug combinations involving fluoxetine and losartan with gefitinib or erlotinib yielded significant degrees of inhibition of the metabolism of gefitinib, but not for that of erlotinib. CONCLUSION: As could be predicted by previous studies involving the inhibitory effect of fluoxetine on CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and studies involving CYP metabolism of gefitinib and erlotinib, the tests performed here confirmed that fluoxetine has an inhibitory effect on metabolism of gefitinib or erlotinib by the main CYP isoenzymes involved. This study suggests a variable inhibitory effect of fluoxetine particularly on CYP2D6 activity towards gefitinib or erlotinib; erlotinib metabolism is less affected. Likewise, the combination of fluoxetine and losartan does not significantly affect hepatocyte metabolism of erlotinib, but does for that of gefitinib. The results presented in this study thus indicate a need for DDI assays to involve multiple drugs to properly study multidrug regimens.","output":"Pre-clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) of gefitinib or erlotinib with Cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibiting drugs, fluoxetine and/or losartan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first documented case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) occurred in 2012, and outbreaks have continued ever since, mainly in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV is primarily diagnosed using a real-time RT-PCR assay, with at least two different genomic targets required for a positive diagnosis according to the case definition of The World Health Organization (WHO) as of 3 July 2013. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to develop as many specific genetic diagnostic methods as possible to allow stable diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections. METHODS: Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a genetic diagnostic method used widely for the detection of viral pathogens, which requires only a single temperature for amplification, and can be completed in less than 1 h. This study developed a novel RT-LAMP assay for detecting MERS-CoV using primer sets targeting a conserved nucleocapsid protein region. RESULTS: The RT-LAMP assay was capable of detecting as few as 3.4 copies of MERS-CoV RNA, and was highly specific, with no cross-reaction to other respiratory viruses. Pilot experiments to detect MERS-CoV from medium containing pharyngeal swabs inoculated with pre-titrated viruses were also performed. The RT-LAMP assay exhibited sensitivity similar to that of MERS-CoV real-time RT-PCR.

Individuals maintained on immunosuppression appear to be especially susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) frequently require immunosuppression and may be at increased risk for developing COVID-19. The incidence and impact of COVID-19 on patients with AAV is currently not known. We aimed to investigate this impact via a telephone questionnaire-based patient survey and chart review. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of AAV patients followed at two centers was conducted. Data regarding demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were confirmed by chart review. A telephone survey was conducted to ascertain symptoms and contact exposure related to COVID-19, as well as changes in health care delivery during the pandemic period between January and July, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 206 patients surveyed, the median age was 64 years, 51% were female and mean (SD) disease duration was 7 (5) years. The majority had kidney (n = 160) and lung (n = 108) involvement. Seventy-five percent (n = 155) were receiving immunosuppression, with 77 patients (50%) receiving rituximab during the pandemic period. Of the 10 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) by PCR, three were positive. Patients had a significant disruption in care; none had an in-person visit and 69% had a telemedicine consultation. Rituximab maintenance was postponed in 21 patients. Twelve patients experienced disease relapse. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with AAV appears to be similar to that of the general population. For a patient population that requires active clinical surveillance, there is significant disruption in care as a result of the pandemic. Reduction of immunosuppression may not be indicated, and the risk of relapse likely far outweighs the risk of COVID-19.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with ANCA associated vasculitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A large segment of the maternal and child population in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) is malnourished.

RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3 untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global up-regulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes. IMPORTANCE IBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this pathogen, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV, and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intra-species variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. We also identify numerous cellular genes and gene networks that are differentially expressed during virus infection, giving insights into the host cell reponse to IBV infection.","output":"Comparative analysis of gene expression in virulent and attenuated strains of infectious bronchitis virus at sub-codon resolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nsp1 protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an alphacoronavirus, efficiently suppressed protein synthesis in mammalian cells.

Universal sampling for qualitative testing(by COVID-19 IgG rapid test device by Voxpress) was done and the samples which tested positive were subjected to quantitative testing (chemiluminescent immunoassay) by Serial testing.3 Results: A total of 1005 HCWs were tested out of which 124(12.3%) tested positive by qualitative test and 101(10%) tested positive by both tests. Out of the 1005 HCWs, 155(15.4%) were doctors and 496 (49.4%) were nurses. There was statistically no significant difference between the seropositivity of HCWs with regards to the designation, age, place of work, duration of work in this DCH and Comorbidities.

While it is generally expected that taking samples for analysis with PCR testing gives more reliable results than using antigen test kits, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the two protocols in the field have not yet been estimated without assuming that the PCR test constitutes a gold standard. We use latent class models to estimate the in situ performance of both PCR and antigen testing, using data from the Danish national registries. The results are based on 240,000 paired tests results sub-selected from the 55 million test results that were obtained in Denmark during the period from February 2021 until June 2021. We found that the specificity of both tests is very high in our data sample (>99.7%), while the sensitivity of PCR sampling was estimated to be 95.7% (95% CI: 92.8-98.4%) and that of the antigen test kits used in Denmark over the study period was estimated at 53.8% (95% CI: 49.8-57.9%). Our findings can be used as supplementary information for consideration when implementing serial testing strategies that employ a confirmatory PCR sample following a positive result from an antigen test kit, such as the policy used in Denmark. We note that while this strategy reduces the number of false positives associated with antigen test screening, it also increases the false negatives. We demonstrate that the balance of trading false positives for false negatives only favours the use of serial testing when the expected true prevalence is low. Our results contain substantial uncertainty in the estimates for sensitivity due to the relatively small number of positive test results over this period: validation of our findings in a population with higher prevalence would therefore be highly relevant for future work.","output":"Evaluation of diagnostic test procedures for SARS-CoV-2 using latent class models: comparison of antigen test kits and sampling for PCR testing based on Danish national data registries (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: Peptide/protein-based inhalers are excessively used to treat respiratory disorders.

Using confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron tomography (ET), we examined viral protein distribution and the ultrastructural changes that occur during TBFV infection. Within host cells, flaviviruses cause complex rearrangement of cellular membranes for the purpose of virus replication. Virus infection was accompanied by a marked expansion in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) staining and markers for TBFV replication were localized mainly to the ER in both cell lines. TEM of Vero cells showed membrane-bound vesicles enclosed in a network of dilated, anastomosing ER cisternae. Virions were seen within the ER and were sometimes in paracrystalline arrays. Tubular structures or elongated vesicles were occasionally noted. In acutely and persistently infected ISE6 cells, membrane proliferation and vesicles were also noted; however, the extent of membrane expansion and the abundance of vesicles were lower and no viral particles were observed. Tubular profiles were far more prevalent in persistently infected ISE6 cells than in acutely infected cells. By ET, tubular profiles, in persistently infected tick cells, had a cross-sectional diameter of 60C100 nm, reached up to 800 nm in length, were closed at the ends, and were often arranged in fascicle-like bundles, shrouded with ER membrane.

The translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome for most open reading frames (ORFs) occurs via RNA intermediates termed \\"subgenomic RNAs.\\" sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription, which relies on homology between transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-B) upstream of the ORF start codons and that of the TRS-L, which is located in the 5' UTR. TRS-L is immediately preceded by a leader sequence. This leader sequence is therefore found at the 5' end of all sgRNA. We applied periscope to 1155 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Sheffield, United Kingdom, and validated our findings using orthogonal data sets and in vitro cell systems. By using a simple local alignment to detect reads that contain the leader sequence, we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and noncanonical sgRNA. We were able to detect all canonical sgRNAs at the expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10. A number of recurrent noncanonical sgRNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sgRNA analysis. In VeroE6 ACE2+/- cell lines, periscope can detect the changes in the kinetics of sgRNA in orthogonal sequencing data sets. Finally, variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sgRNAs with high fidelity in most cases.

In the USA, the number of diagnosed individuals reached 48 million with 92,000 Death cases. Despite the lower pathogenicity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the high infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 results in large numbers of hospitalizations and deaths worldwide. The SARS-Cov-2 is an enveloped virus and belongs to the beta coronavirus family containing a large and complex positive-sense single stranded RNA genome (~30kb). It binds to human ACE2 receptor with high affinity via its spike protein (S) and membrane fusion leading to the release of its genomic RNA that replicates and produce higher number of sub-genomic RNAs. The viral RNA is then capped by nsp 14 and nsp10/16, two nonstructural proteins that catalyze the methylation of RNA to limit its degradation by cellular 5'-3' exonuclease and evade host immune system. These enzymes play critical role in translation of the viral RNA and its replication and thus leading to viral survival.

This study assessed community stakeholders perceptions in parts of Southeastern Nigeria about COVID-19 vaccine, towards engaging them effectively to ensure the success of the vaccination campaigns. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted involving fourteen stakeholders from the Southeastern geo-political zone of Nigeria selected using purposive sampling. In-depth semi-structured individual interviews lasting about 30 min were used to collect data. Data analysis was informed by a general inductive approach. RESULTS: Stakeholders hoped that the development and roll out of the vaccines will bring COVID -19 to an end, will help to maintain good health and allow people get back to normal life. On the other hand, stakeholders expressed their concerns and worries about the speed with which the vaccines are being produced, possibility of future adverse effects from vaccination, misinformation, and level of preparedness in the health system to implement the vaccine campaign.

The rate of diagnosis of viral pneumonia is increasingly approaching 60% among children identified as having community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Clinical presentation ranges from mild to severe pneumonitis complicated by respiratory failure in severe cases. The most vulnerable patients, the elderly and those living with cancer, report a relevant mortality rate. No clinical characteristics can be useful to conclusively distinguish the different etiology of viral pneumonia. However, accessory symptoms, such as anosmia or ageusia together with respiratory symptoms suggest COVID-19. An etiologic-based treatment of viral pneumonia is possible in a small percentage of cases only. Neuraminidase inhibitors have been proven to reduce the need for ventilatory support and mortality rate while only a few data support the large-scale use of other antivirals.

METHODS: An extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The vaccine was modeled as a single dose vaccine with 90% and 70% efficacy. The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths. RESULTS: The use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest percentage reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed.

Simulation-based team training within emergency medicine and critical care contexts is best known for its use by trauma teams and teams involved in cardiac arrest. In the domain of emergency medicine, simulation-based team training is also used for other typical time-critical clinical presentations. We aimed to review the existing literature and current state of evidence pertaining to non-technical skills obtained via simulation-based team training in emergency medicine and critical care contexts, excluding trauma and cardiac arrest contexts. METHODS This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Before the initiation of the study, the protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database. We conducted a systematic literature search of 10 years of publications, up to December 17, 2019, in the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. Two authors independently reviewed all the studies and extracted data. RESULTS Of the 456 studies screened, 29 trials were subjected to full-text review, and 13 studies were included in the final review. None of the studies was randomized controlled trials, and no studies compared simulation training to different modalities of training. Studies were heterogeneous; they applied simulation-training concepts of different durations and intensities and used different outcome measures for non-technical skills. Two studies reached Kirkpatrick level 3. Out of the remaining 11 studies, nine reached Kirkpatrick level 2, and two reached Kirkpatrick level 1. CONCLUSIONS The literature on simulation-based team training in emergency medicine is heterogeneous and sparse, but somewhat supports the hypothesis that simulation-based team training is beneficial to teams' knowledge and attitudes toward non-technical skills (Kirkpatrick level 2). Randomized trials are called for to clarify the effect of simulation compared to other modalities of team training.

Recent studies revealed that non-classical HLA-(HLA-E & HLA-G) based immunotherapies have many advantages over traditional HLA-based immunotherapy, particularly against cancer and COVID-19 infection. In the last two decades, several methods have been developed to predict the binders of classical HLA alleles. In contrast, limited attempts have been made to develop methods for predicting non-classical HLA binding peptides, due to the scarcity of sufficient experimental data. Of note, in order to facilitate the scientific community, we have developed an artificial intelligence-based method for predicting binders of class-Ib HLA alleles.

The purified recombinant S1 protein was found to mediate highly potent antibody responses in immunized rabbits. The antibodies strongly recognized the recombinant S1 protein from cell lysates and supernatants of S1-expressing cells, whereas they bound weakly to the authentic S protein of PEDV vaccine strain SM98-1. Furthermore, a serum neutralization test revealed that the rabbit antisera completely inhibit infection of the PEDV vaccine strain at a serum dilution of 1:16. We then tested the ability of vaccination with the recombinant S1 protein to protect piglets against PEDV. Late-term pregnant sows were inoculated intramuscularly with the purified S1 protein, and the outcome was investigated in passively immunized suckling piglets after a virulent PEDV challenge. The results showed that vaccination with S1 protein efficiently protected neonatal piglets against PEDV. Our data suggest that the recombinant S1 protein shows potential as an effective and safe subunit vaccine for PED prevention.","output":"Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant S1 domain of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution is responsible for a wide range of health effects in exposed populations. Variations in local air pollution can affect local population health outcomes. The strict regulations imposed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (lockdowns) resulted in a unique situation where human mobility was limited significantly, resulting in improved air quality in several major cities. The main goal of this study was to investigate if lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted air quality in Birmingham, Alabamaa city with a history of high air pollution levelswith a focus on PM(2.5) (Particulate Matter with an aerodynamic diameter 2.5 m) and NO(2) (Nitrogen dioxide). Daily air pollutant and traffic data were obtained for the Birmingham Metropolitan Area for the period January to October 2020, and previous years. Mean PM(2.5) and NO(2) concentrations and traffic volumes during the official city/state lockdown period (24 March to 30 April 2020) were compared to pre- and post-lockdown means. The mean PM(2.5) and NO(2) concentrations during the lockdown did not significantly differ from that of the pre- or post-lockdown periods. However, NO(2) significantly decreased even after the lockdown order was removed, with the mean decreasing significantly compared to pre-lockdown and lockdown periods. Both PM(2.5) and NO(2) annual means in 2020 were significantly lower than the annual means in 2019, indicating the occurrence of significant changes over the longer term that were not limited by defined lockdown periods. Traffic significantly increased after the lockdown order was removed but did not correlate with the two pollutants studied. Therefore, we conclude that the Stay at Home/lockdown regulations and other COVID-19 restrictions had an impact on the air quality of Birmingham Alabama; although these lockdown impacts varied for each pollutant and were not limited only by the official lockdown dates/periods.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Related Changes on Air Quality in Birmingham, Alabama, United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, the Southern California Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Consortium was formed.

The literature on methods for aligning tractograms is in active development and provides methods that operate either from voxel information, e.g. fractional anisotropy, orientation distribution function, T1-weighted MRI, or directly from streamline information. In this work, we align streamlines using the linear assignment problem (LAP) and propose a method to reduce the high computational cost of aligning whole brain tractograms. As further contribution, we present a comparison among some of the freely-available linear and nonlinear tractogram alignment methods, where we show that our LAP-based method outperforms all others.

During the COVID-19 pandemic concerns were raised that FNE had the potential of generating aerosols resulting in human cross-contamination when performed on SARS-COV2 carriers. In the UK, and other European countries, national guidelines were issued restricting FNE to essential cases. We surveyed ENT UK members and Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) members to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (first peak) on FNE practice in the UK. Methods: An observational internet-based survey constructed in accordance to the CHERRIES checklist and setup in SurveyMonkeyof FNE practice amongst UK-based ENT surgeons and speech and language therapists in community clinics, the outpatient department, inpatient wards, ICU, emergency department and operating theatres (through the NHS and private sector) prior to, during and following the first COVID-19 wave in the UK. Results: 314 responses collected (24% response rate), 82% from ENT clinicians, 17% from SLTs and 1% from other allied healthcare professionals. Overall, there has been a large reduction in the volume and indications for FNE during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with limited recovery by mid-August 2020. Cancer and airway assessments were impacted less. A wide range of FNE protocols influenced by local factors are reported, varying in endoscope preference, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and sterilization methods. Where dedicated Aerosol Generating Procedure (AGP) rooms were unavailable, clinicians resorted to window opening and variable room down-time between patients. Endoscope preference reflected availability and user familiarity, ENT trainees favoring the use of single-use video endoscopes.

This feeling can become a barrier against the achievement of the immunity necessary to stop the expansion of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 in Spain, as well as to identify the factors that have an influence on the concerns and attitudes of people against accepting the vaccine in the months prior to the start of vaccination on December 2020. An online questionnaire was created to obtain information about (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) concerns and sources of information about vaccines; and (3) attitudes about vaccination and state of health. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors. Of the 2501 participants, 1207 (48.3%) would accept the COVID-19 vaccine, 623 (24.9%) were hesitant, and 671 (26.8%) would reject it. The logistic regression showed that being male, older than 60, married, retired, with a high level of education, or with a leftist political inclination, could increase the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. Disinformation and the lack of political consensus were the main sources of distrust. The patients with hypertension, immunodepression, hypercholesterolemia, or respiratory disease, or were overweight, showed a greater acceptance to the vaccine, while those with cancer took the longest to accept it. A low acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 was observed among the Spanish population in the phase prior to its availability, and the main fears of the population were identified. It is necessary to offer correct and transparent information about these vaccines to reduce the concerns and increase the trust of the population, to thereby guarantee the success of the vaccination campaigns.","output":"Willingness to Be Vaccinated against COVID-19 in Spain before the Start of Vaccination: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2016, the news that Googles artificial intelligence (AI) robot AlphaGo, based on the principle of deep learning, won the victory over lee Sedol, the former world Go champion and the famous 9th Dan competitor of Korea, caused a sensation in both fields of AI and Go, which brought epoch-making significance to the development of deep learning.

This is an important differential diagnosis to consider if after a period of improvement, an infected patient develops fever, pain around the region of the thyroid (throat/neck) and/or symptoms of hyperthyroidism. INTERPRETATION: Subacute thyroiditis is thought to be initiated by a viral infection or postviral inflammatory process, often in patients with a history of an upper respiratory infection typically two to eight weeks prior to the onset of thyroiditis.

Virtual patient simulators (VPSs) may partially meet these needs. Natural language processing (NLP) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may further enhance the educational impact of these simulators. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop a VPS for clinical diagnostic reasoning that integrates interaction in natural language and an ITS. We also aimed to provide preliminary results of a short-term learning test administered on undergraduate students after use of the simulator. METHODS: We trained a Siamese long short-term memory network for anamnesis and NLP algorithms combined with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology for diagnostic hypothesis generation. The ITS was structured on the concepts of knowledge, assessment, and learner models. To assess short-term learning changes, 15 undergraduate medical students underwent two identical tests, composed of multiple-choice questions, before and after performing a simulation by the virtual simulator. The test was made up of 22 questions; 11 of these were core questions that were specifically designed to evaluate clinical knowledge related to the simulated case. RESULTS: We developed a VPS called Hepius that allows students to gather clinical information from the patients medical history, physical exam, and investigations and allows them to formulate a differential diagnosis by using natural language. Hepius is also an ITS that provides real-time step-by-step feedback to the student and suggests specific topics the student has to review to fill in potential knowledge gaps.

At 1.2-M concentration, lycorine reduced viral titers of West Nile (WNV), dengue, and yellow fever viruses by 10(2)- to 10(4)-fold. However, the compound did not inhibit an alphavirus (Western equine encephalitis virus) or a rhabdovirus (vesicular stomatitis virus), indicating a selective antiviral spectrum. The compound exerts its antiviral activity mainly through suppression of viral RNA replication. A ValMet substitution at the 9th amino acid position of the viral 2K peptide (spanning the endoplasmic reticulum membrane between NS4A and NS4B proteins) confers WNV resistance to lycorine, through enhancement of viral RNA replication. Initial chemistry synthesis demonstrated that modifications of the two hydroxyl groups of lycorine can increase the compounds potency, while reducing its cytotoxicity. Taken together, the results have established lycorine as a flavivirus inhibitor for antiviral development. The lycorine-resistance results demonstrate a direct role of the 2K peptide in flavivirus RNA synthesis.","output":"A single-amino acid substitution in West Nile virus 2K peptide between NS4A and NS4B confers resistance to lycorine, a flavivirus inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are drivers of a subset of lung cancers.

An 82-year-old woman developed sudden left hemiparesis and aphasia during an urgent cardiac catheterization procedure for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. She had a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of at least 10 and no improvement with intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral angiography was performed with conscious sedation, confirming an occlusion of the superior division of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Using standard technique, a Trevo thrombectomy device was deployed across the clot. Post-thrombectomy control angiography demonstrated complete revascularization of the right MCA. The device was then gently withdrawn without difficulty. Immediately afterward the patient's blood pressure showed a sudden and significant elevation. Immediate posttreatment angiography demonstrated active extravasation from the posterior wall of the communicating segment of the right internal carotid artery. Rapid cessation of bleeding was achieved with intravenous administration of protamine and induced hypotension. Immediate neurological assessment was performed, which showed motor improvement. An immediate postintervention CT scan confirmed a moderate-sized subarachnoid hemorrhage and contrast in the prepontine cistern. The patient was discharged home on postoperative Day 3 with an NIHSS score of zero. At 6-month follow-up in the neurointerventional clinic, her NIHSS and modified Rankin Scale scores were both zero.

Although most COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, some present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhoea, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain as the major complaints. These features may be attributable to the following facts: (a) COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients, and 20% of patients showed prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faecal samples after the virus converting to negative in the respiratory system. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to actively infect and replicate in the GI tract. Moreover, GI infection could be the first manifestation antedating respiratory symptoms; patients suffering only digestive symptoms but no respiratory symptoms as clinical manifestation have also been reported. Thus, the implications of digestive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is of great importance. In this review, we summarise recent findings on the epidemiology of GI tract involvement, potential mechanisms of faecalCoral transmission, GI and liver manifestation, pathological/histological features in patients with COVID-19 and the diagnosis, management of patients with pre-existing GI and liver diseases as well as precautions for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection during GI endoscopy procedures.","output":"Involvement of digestive system in COVID-19: manifestations, pathology, management and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a new human disease with few effective treatments1.

OBJECTIVE This study examines the incidence, characteristics, risk factors for mortality as well as long-term prognosis following cardiac arrest in intensive care. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Five noncardiac surgical ICUs (41 surgical and 37 medical beds) at a German university hospital between 2016 and 2019. PATIENTS Adults experiencing cardiac arrest defined as the need for chest compressions and/or defibrillation occurring for the first time on the ICU. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary endpoint: occurrence of cardiac-arrest in the ICU. Secondary endpoints: diagnostic and therapeutic measures; risk factors and marginal probabilities of no-return of spontaneous circulation; rates of return of spontaneous circulation, hospital discharge, 1-year-survival and 1-year-neurological outcome. RESULTS A total of 114 cardiac arrests were observed out of 14 264 ICU admissions; incidence 0.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 1.0; 45.6% received at least one additional diagnostic test, such as blood gas analysis (36%), echocardiography (19.3%) or chest x-ray (9.9%) with a resulting change in therapy in 52%, (more frequently in those with a return of spontaneous circulation vs none, P = 0.023). Risk factors for no-return of spontaneous circulation were cardiac comorbidities (OR 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 20.7) and continuous renal replacement therapy (OR 5.9; 95% CI, 1.7 to 20.8). Bicarbonate levels greater than 21 mmol l-1 were associated with a higher mortality risk in combination either with cardiac comorbidities (bicarbonate <21 mmol l-1: 13%; 21 to 26 mmol l-1: 45%; >26 mmol l-1: 42%) or with a SOFA at least 2 (bicarbonate <21 mmol l-1: 8%; 21 to 26 mmol l-1: 40%; >26 mmol l-1: 37%). In-hospital mortality was 78.1% (n=89); 1-year-survival-rate was 10.5% (95% CI, 5.5 to 17.7) and survival with a good neurological outcome was 6.1% (95% CI, 2.5 to 12.2). CONCLUSION Cardiac arrest in ICU is a rare complication with a high mortality and low rate of good neurological outcome. The development of a structured approach to resuscitation should include all available resources of an ICU and adequately consider the complete diagnostic and therapeutic spectra as our results indicate that these are still underused. The development of prediction models of death should take into account cardiac and hepatic comorbidities, continuous renal replacement therapy, SOFA at least 2 before cardiac arrest and bicarbonate level. Further research should concentrate on identifying early predictors and on the prevention of cardiac arrest in ICU.","output":"Incidence, characteristics and predictors of mortality following cardiac arrest in ICUs of a German university hospital: A retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected more than 1900 humans, since 2012. The syndrome ranges from asymptomatic and mild cases to severe pneumonia and death. The virus is believed to be circulating in dromedary camels without notable symptoms since the 1980s. Therefore, dromedary camels are considered the only animal source of infection. Neither antiviral drugs nor vaccines are approved for veterinary or medical use despite active research on this area. Here, we developed four vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV based on ChAdOx1 and MVA viral vectors, two candidates per vector. All vaccines contained the full-length spike gene of MERS-CoV; ChAdOx1 MERS vaccines were produced with or without the leader sequence of the human tissue plasminogen activator gene (tPA) where MVA MERS vaccines were produced with tPA, but either the mH5 or F11 promoter driving expression of the spike gene. All vaccine candidates were evaluated in a mouse model in prime only or prime-boost regimens. ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA induced higher neutralising antibodies than ChAdOx1 MERS without tPA. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA elicited cellular immune responses as well as neutralising antibodies that were boosted to a significantly higher level by MVA MERS. The humoral immunogenicity of a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA was equivalent to two doses of MVA MERS (also with tPA). MVA MERS with mH5 or F11 promoter induced similar antibody levels; however, F11 promoter enhanced the cellular immunogenicity of MVA MERS to significantly higher magnitudes. In conclusion, our study showed that MERS-CoV vaccine candidates could be optimized by utilising different viral vectors, various genetic designs of the vectors, or different regimens to increase immunogenicity. ChAdOx1 and MVA vectored vaccines have been safely evaluated in camels and humans and these MERS vaccine candidates should now be tested in camels and in clinical trials.","output":"ChAdOx1 and MVA based vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV elicit neutralising antibodies and cellular immune responses in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surface architecting of the catalyst is a hopeful method to expand the surface property of the impetus material for upgrading their response towards the chemical reaction.

A steady decrease in daily HRV and increase in daily RHR were generally seen during pregnancy (HRV Est. = -0.10, P<0.0001; RHR Est. = 0.05, P<0.0001). The effect was moderated by activity minutes for both HRV and RHR. However, at 49 days prior to birth there was a reversal of these indices with a steady increase in daily HRV (Est.=0.38, P< 0.0001) and decrease in daily RHR (Est. = -0.23, P< 0.0001), regardless of activity level, that continued into the postpartum period. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy women, there were significant changes to HRV and RHR throughout pregnancy, including a rapid improvement in cardiovascular health prior to birth that was not otherwise known. Physical activity minutes of any type moderated the known negative consequences of pregnancy on cardiovascular health. By establishing normal changes using daily data, future research can now evaluate disease states as well as physical activity interventions during pregnancy and their impact on cardiovascular fitness.","output":"Monitoring One Heart to Help Two: Heart Rate Variability and Resting Heart Rate using Wearable Technology in Active Women Across the Perinatal Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction.

Therefore, using effective strategies to retain human resources is one of the most important issues during outbreaks. This study aims to collect and classify the proposed interventions to strengthen human health resources and their sustainability during epidemics through scoping review. Methods: : In this scoping review study, 2300 studies were retrieved through searching international databases CPubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science. The retrieved studies were screened, and finally, 50 studies were included for analysis. The strategies were classified using inductive qualitative content analysis. Results: : Most of the studies were conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom. The target population in 39 studies was all health workers;five studies were on physicians, five studies on nurses, and only one study on dentists. The proposed interventions were classified into five categories: preparation, protection, support, treatment, and feedback. Discussion: Most studies focused on providing interventions in one or two dimensions of human resources, but these interventions were summarized and categorized in this review. Therefore, this study has a holistic view of various dimensions of strengthening and maintaining human health resources during epidemics by providing a thematic map. Considering that human beings are multidimensional, policymakers and managers of the health system should use a set of interventions that simultaneously cover different aspects of their needs to strengthen and maintain HCWs.","output":"Interventions for Improving Health Care Workers Retention in Epidemics C a Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goals of distance education in higher institutions were clear for many years. Nowadays, owing to the global pandemic situation, higher educational institutions (HEI) have had to transition from conventional teaching modes to online modes.

Evidence has shown the benefits of home-based stroke rehabilitation, but little is known about resource-efficient ways to enhance its effectiveness, nor has anyone explored the value of leveraging low-cost home health aides (HHAs) to reinforce repetitive task training, a key component of home-based rehabilitation. We developed and piloted a Stroke Homehealth Aide Recovery Program (SHARP) that deployed specially trained HHAs as peer coaches to mentor frontline aides and help individuals recovering from stroke increase their mobility through greater adherence to repetitive exercise regimens. We assessed the feasibility of SHARP and its readiness for a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT). Specifically, we examined (1) the practicability of recruitment and randomization procedures, (2) program acceptability, (3) intervention fidelity, and (4) the performance of outcome measures. METHODS: This was a feasibility study including a pilot RCT. Target enrollment was 60 individuals receiving post-stroke home health services, who were randomized to SHARP + usual home care or usual care only. The protocol specified a 30-day intervention with four planned in-home coach visits, including one joint coach/physical therapist visit. The primary participant outcome was 60-day change in mobility, using the performance-based Timed Up and Go and 4-Meter Walk Gait Speed tests. Interviews with participants, coaches, physical therapists, and frontline aides provided acceptability data. Enrollment figures, visit tracking reports, and audio recordings provided intervention fidelity data. Mixed methods included thematic analysis of qualitative data and quantitative analysis of structured data to examine the intervention feasibility and performance of outcome measures. RESULTS: Achieving the 60-participant enrollment target required modifying participant eligibility criteria to accommodate a decline in the receipt of HHA services among individuals receiving home care after a stroke. This modification entailed intervention redesign. Acceptability was high among coaches and participants but lower among therapists and frontline aides. Intervention fidelity was mixed: 87% of intervention participants received all four planned coach visits; however, no joint coach/therapist visits occurred. Sixty-day follow-up retention was 78%. However, baseline and follow-up performance-based primary outcome mobility assessments could be completed for only 55% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: The trial was not feasible in its current form. Before progressing to a definitive trial, significant program redesign would be required to address issues affecting enrollment, coach/HHA/therapist coordination, and implementation of performance-based outcome measures.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between triploid and full-sib diploid poplar trees were identified from two transcriptomic data sets followed by a gene association study among DEGs to identify key leaf growth regulators. Yeast one-hybrid system, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and dual-luciferase assay were employed to substantiate that PpnGRF5-1 directly regulated PpnCKX1.

Almost all patients received mRNA-based vaccine, 4 patients had a heterologous scheme. Neutralizing capacity (NC) and levels of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein were evaluated together with quantification of activation markers on T-cells and their production of key cytokines 4 weeks after first and second vaccination. Findings: Overall, a total of 92 patients were included in the final study cohort with the median age of 50 years [IRQ: 39-56] and a 50% female ratio. 337% patients were on TNFi, 261% on IL-17i, 261% on JAKi, each group encompassing patients receiving drug inhibitors alone or in combination with MTX. 141% were treated with MTX alone. Although after first vaccination only 378% patients presented neutralizing antibodies, the majority (945%) showed neutralizing antibodies after second vaccination. Spike-protein specific IgG antibodies were found in 989% of all patients. Patients on IL17i developed the highest titers compared to the other modes of action. Co-administration of MTX led to lower titers compared to b/tsDMARD monotherapy. NC correlated well with IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein titers. T-cell immunity revealed similar frequencies of activated T-cells and cytokine profiles across therapies. Interpretation: Even after insufficient seroconversion for NC and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike-proteins in AIRD patients between different modes of action after first vaccination, a second vaccination covered almost all patients regardless of DMARDs therapy, with better outcomes in those on IL-17i.

Some concerns have been raised regarding the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, largely based on case-reports of serious thromboembolic events after vaccination. Some mechanisms have been suggested which might explain the adverse cardiovascular reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Different vaccine platforms are currently available which include live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, vector vaccines, DNA vaccines and RNA vaccines. Vaccines increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells. Once synthetized, the Spike proteins assembled in the cytoplasma migrate to the cell surface and protrude with a native-like conformation. These proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response. Such response appears to be quite vigorous in the presence of DNA vaccines which encode viral vectors, as well as in subjects who are immunized because of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The resulting pathological features may resemble those of active coronavirus disease. The free-floating Spike proteins synthetized by cells targeted by vaccine and destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood and systematically interact with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed by a variety of cells including platelets, thereby promoting ACE2 internalization and degradation. These reactions may ultimately lead to platelet aggregation, thrombosis and inflammation mediated by several mechanisms including platelet ACE2 receptors. Whereas Phase III vaccine trials generally excluded participants with previous immunization, vaccination of huge populations in the real life will inevitably include individuals with preexisting immunity. This might lead to excessively enhanced inflammatory and thrombotic reactions in occasional subjects.

Based on results obtained in chromatography for andrographolide content analysis of six genotypes, two contrast genotypes, i.e. IC-520361 (maximum andrographolide content2.33%) and Anand Local (lowest andrographolide content1.01%) were selected for the transcriptome analysis. A total of 1.04 Gb of raw data were produced using MiSeq Illumina platform, in which IC 520361 generated 645 million base pairs sequence along with 4,524,251 raw reads and Anand Local produced 419 million base pairs sequence along with 3,021,316 raw reads. The combined assembly of high quality reads generated for both the samples had 33,247,454 bp of total assembled bases and 38,292 of transcripts. The GC percent of assembled transcripts was 44.79%, an average read length was 800 bp and N(50) value was 1186 bp. Species-specific distribution using BLAST X (Nr), showed the highest Blast hits with Sesamum indicum. Out of 23,346 transcripts, 87% of transcripts annotated in UniProt KB (Universal Protein Resource KnowledgeBase) database and only 0.21% of transcripts were annotated in TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resources). Biological processes gene ontology classified based on Blast2GO showed, out of 6853 transcripts, 1370 of transcripts were represented by terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, which involved in secondary metabolite andrographolide biosynthesis. The heat map showed 1016 transcripts were differentially expressed between two kalmegh genotypes, in which nine important differentially expressed transcripts related to MEP (2C methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate) and MVA (Mevalonic acid) andrographolide biosynthesis pathways such as, geranyl diphosphate synthase small subunit, Isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase i-like, 4, 13-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase etc. were upregulated in IC 520361 as compared to Anand Local, which were validated through RT-qPCR. The highest expression of gene 13-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase (HMGR) was reported, which is responsible for accumulation of andrographolide in leaf. This comparative transcriptome analysis confirmed the expression level of genes were higher in accession IC 520361 as compare to Anand Local related to andrographolide biosynthesis pathways i.e. MEP and MVA. These up-regulated genes could be over-expressed to enhance the andrographolide content using genetic engineering of these metabolic pathways. It will also give an idea to the breeder for development of molecular markers for direct screening of the genotypes.

Sick leave can be seen as an indicator of health in a working age population, and the present study aimed to investigate sick-leave patterns after Covid-19, and potential factors predicting longer sick leave in hospitalised and non-hospitalised people with Covid-19. METHODS: The present study is a comprehensive national registry-based study in Sweden with a 4-month follow-up. All people who started to receive sickness benefits for Covid-19 during March 1 to August 31, 2020, were included. Predictors of sick leave 1 month and long Covid (12 weeks) were analysed with logistic regression in the total population and in separate models depending on inpatient care due to Covid-19. RESULTS: A total of 11,955 people started sick leave for Covid-19 within the inclusion period. The median sick leave was 35 days, 13.3% were on sick leave for long Covid, and 9.0% remained on sick leave for the whole follow-up period. There were 2960 people who received inpatient care due to Covid-19, which was the strongest predictor of longer sick leave. Sick leave the year prior to Covid-19 and older age also predicted longer sick leave. No clear pattern of socioeconomic factors was noted. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of people are on sick leave due to Covid-19. Sick leave may be protracted, and sick leave for long Covid is quite common. The severity of Covid-19 (needing inpatient care), prior sick leave, and age all seem to predict the likelihood of longer sick leave. However, no socioeconomic factor could clearly predict longer sick leave, indicating the complexity of this condition. The group needing long sick leave after Covid-19 seems to be heterogeneous, indicating a knowledge gap.

Through this global spread, many nations have witnessed exponential growth of confirmed cases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or lockdown measures. However, some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this exponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt to safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to quantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by means of training neural network models to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative infected and by using such models in an optimisation study aimed at understanding the best set of mitigating actions. Data for two nations, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model government restrictions in traveling, testing and enforcement of social distance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government actions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter entry restrictions benefit both nations, resulting in significantly less confirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but milder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting Taiwan's lack of nationwide lockdown. The results, found with a purely data-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical epidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that the data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.","output":"Optimisation of non-pharmaceutical measures in COVID-19 growth via neural networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeTo evaluate the effect of graft preparation and organ\\\\culture storage on endothelial cell density (ECD) and viability of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) grafts.MethodsDMEK grafts (n = 27) were prepared at Amnitrans EyeBank Rotterdam from 27 corneas (15 donors) that were eligible for transplantation but could not be allocated due to the Covid\\\\19\\\\related cancellation of elective surgeries.

We used the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist developed for cross-sectional studies to appraise the quality of the included studies. All stages of the review conducted by two independent reviewers and potential discrepancies were solved with a consultation with a third reviewer. We reported the result as number and percentage. A meta-analysis conducted using a random effect model with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies encompassing 76,848 participants were included in this review. 56.53% of the participants were female. The mean age of the participants was 33.7 years. 85.42% of the included studies were scored as good quality, 12.50% as fair quality, and the remaining (2.08%) as low quality. About 87.5% examined all three components of the KAPs model. The knowledge component was reported as good and poor in 89.5% and 10.5% of the included studies, respectively.

Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic compelled restrictions regarding social interactions and mobility in Italy from March 2020, prompting telemedicine approaches for supporting patients and their families confined at home. We reported our experience regarding the effects of psychological phone-intervention (phone-I) on EOAD caregivers during pandemic. Twenty caregivers of EOAD patients were randomly assigned to treatment (TG) or control (CG) group. TG weekly underwent a phone-I for one month. All participants were assessed for caregiver burden and needs, anxiety and depression levels, and subjective impact of traumatic events at baseline (T0), at the fifth week (T1) and after 6 months (T2) from phone-I. We observed higher vulnerability to post-traumatic stress in TG compared to CG in all timepoints (p  0.05). Decreased stress effects and caregiver burden were revealed in TG at T1 compared to T0 (p  0.05), although showing an increase of these measures at T2 in the treated caregivers. Our findings suggest that although TG showed a peculiar vulnerability to post-traumatic stress, they showed increased wellbeing immediately after phone-I. However, this benefit disappeared six months later, along with the second infection wave, probably due to exhaustion stage achievement in General Adaptation Syndrome.

Apoptosis is considered to be one of the pathogenetic mechanisms in steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Therefore, we performed this study to investigate whether gastrodin has the potential to prevent steroid-induced ONFH. METHODS All 18 male adult Wistar rats were divided equally into three groups: the steroid group, the gastrodin+steroid group, and the control group. Osteonecrosis was induced by low-dose lipopolysaccharide and subsequent high-dose methylprednisolone. Histomorphometric method was used to determine the incidence of osteonecrosis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to detect apoptotic index of osteocytes and osteoblasts. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect mRNA and protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3. Fisher's exact probability test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Turkey's post hoc test were used to examine significant differences between groups. RESULTS The incidence of osteonecrosis in the gastrodin+steroid group (16.7%) was significantly lower than that in the steroid group (83.3%). According to TUNEL assay, the apoptotic indices in the steroid group, the gastrodin+steroid group, and the control group were 91.1%, 27.1%, and 5.4%, respectively, and the differences were significant between groups. Compared with the control group and the gastrodin+steroid group, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bax and Caspase-3 were significantly higher in the steroid group, but the Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly lower.

METHODS: To evaluate CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 as cancer biomarkers, it was generated and characterised several novel specific polyclonal antibodies (PAb), monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and soluble Fab fragments (sFabs) against recombinant CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins, which were obtained from different sources, including a human antibody library and immunised animals. The antibodies and Fab fragments were tested for recognition of native CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins by immunoblotting analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in colorectal cell lines derived from tumour and cancer tissues. RESULTS: Both, antibodies and a Fab fragment showed high specificity since they recognised only their corresponding recombinant antigens, but not a panel of different unrelated- and related proteins. In Western blot analysis of CTHRC1, a monoclonal antibody designated CH21D7 was able to detect a band of the apparent molecular weight of a full-length CTHRC1 in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29. This result was confirmed by a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) with the monoclonal antibodies CH21D7 and CH24G2, detecting CTHRC1 in HT29 and in the colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW620. Similar experiments were performed with PAb, MAbs, and sFab against NFE2L3. The immunoblot analysis showed that the monoclonal antibody 41HF8 recognised NFE2L3 in HT29, and leukocytes. These results were verified by DAS-ELISA assay using the pairs PAb/sFab E5 and MAb 41HF8/sFab E5. Furthermore, an immunoassay for simultaneous detection of the two cancer biomarkers was developed using a Dissociation-Enhanced Lanthanide Fluorescent Immunoassay technology (DELFIA). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the antibodies obtained in this study are specific for CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 since they do not cross-react with unrelated- and related proteins and are useful for specific measurement of native CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 proteins. The antibodies and immunoassays may be useful for the analysis of CTHRC1 and NFE2L3 in clinical samples and for screening of therapeutic compounds in CRC.","output":"Detection of collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 3 in colorectal cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT The use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological tests detect antibodies in the host, contributing to the identification of individuals who have been exposed to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

DESIGN A total of 333 unique, non-duplicated serum samples obtained from COVID-19 patients (n=170) and negative controls (n=163) obtained pre-December 2019 were used in the study. Samples were tested on the Roche E411 and Abbott Architect i4000SR platforms and results were correlated to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results and clinical symptoms. RESULTS There was a strong level of agreement in the qualitative results between both assays with a Cohen's kappa value of 0.840, P<.001. The specificity for both Roche and Abbott were excellent at 100%. Roche exhibited marginally better performance in the 21 days group with a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI 75.8-96.8%) versus Abbott's sensitivity 84.4% (95% CI 68.3 - 93.1%) as well as the 14-20 days group with a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI 65.4 - 95.0%) versus Abbott sensitivity 81.0% (95% CI 60.0 - 92.3%). Less than 14 days of symptoms groups exhibited poor sensitivity at <50% for both assays. The area under curve (AUC  standard error) for Roche (0.894  0.025, P< .001) and Abbott (0.884  0.026, P <.001) were very similar. Potential confounders for negative serological results include antiretroviral medication use and pauci-symptomatic patients.

We aimed to assess changes in the number of visits and characterize the profiles of these patients. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we examined the number of psychiatric ED visits and their proportion among the total number of ED visits. We also evaluated psychiatric visits characteristics during a one-month period after the declaration of deconfinement, and we compared those characteristics to characteristics observed during the same month over the previous 4 years. RESULTS: The number of psychiatric visits to our emergency department during deconfinement was similar to the number observed in the same month of previous years. However, the proportion of psychiatric visits to our emergency department among all visits to the ED rose during deconfinement to a level never before observed. The mean proportion of psychiatric admissions to all ED admissions rose from 3.5% in past years to 5.3% during deconfinement (p = 0.013). Moreover, during deconfinement, more visits (80%) were without an acute intoxication compared to past years (58.5%; p = 0.031). Also, in the deconfinement period, more visits lacked a follow-up consultation organized at discharge (40%) compared to the historical period (25%, p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The deconfinement period after the first wave COVID-19 changed the number and type of psychiatric emergency medicine consultations at our hospital, suggesting a psychiatric impact of confinement during this pandemic.

Timely contact tracing is particularly crucial to limit onwards transmission in settings without established community transmission. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth analysis of the response to a big flight-associated COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam in March 2020 that involved contact tracing, systematic testing and strict quarantine up to third generation contacts. RESULTS: 183 primary contacts from the flight as well as 1,000 secondary and 311 third generation contacts were traced, tested, and quarantined across 15 provinces across Vietnam. The protracted confirmation of the index case at 3 days and 19 hours after arrival resulted in isolation/quarantine delays of 6.8 days (IQR 6.3-6.8) and 5.8 days (IQR 5.8-7.0) for primary and secondary cases, respectively, which generated 84.0 and 26.4 person-days of community exposure from primary and secondary cases, respectively. Nevertheless, only 5 secondary cases occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A large flight-related COVID-19 cluster was successfully contained through timely, systematic and comprehensive public health responses despite delayed index case identification.

Currently, in vivo treatment efficacy of NIR-PIT is observable days after treatment, but monitoring would be improved by more acute detection of intratumor change. Fluorescence imaging may detect increased tumor perfusion immediately after treatment. METHODS: In the first experiment, athymic nude mouse models bearing unilateral subcutaneous flank tumors were treated with either NIR-PIT or laser therapy only. In the second experiment, mice bearing bilateral flank tumors were treated with NIR-PIT only on the left-sided tumor. In both groups, immediately after treatment, indocyanine green was injected at different doses intravenously, and mice were monitored with the Shimadzu LIGHTVISION fluorescence imaging system for 1 hour. RESULTS: Tumor-to-background ratio of fluorescence intensity increased over the 60 minutes of monitoring in treated mice but did not vary significantly in control mice. Tumor-to-background ratio was highest in the 1 mg kg-1 and 0.3 mg kg-1 doses. In mice with bilateral tumors, tumor-to-untreated tumor ratio increased similarly.

We demonstrate, in swine, that infusing angiotensin II or blocking ACE2 induces increased pulmonary artery pressure, reduces blood oxygenation, increases coagulation, disturbs lung perfusion, induces diffuse alveolar damage, and acute tubular necrosis compared to control animals. We further demonstrate that this imbalanced state can be ameliorated by infusion of an angiotensin receptor blocker and low-molecular-weight heparin. In this work, we show that a pathophysiological state in swine induced by RAAS imbalance shares several features with the clinical COVID-19 presentation.

Unlike Ub, which is almost perfectly conserved among eukaryotes, ISG15 is highly divergent, even among mammals. Since zoonotic viruses rely on viral proteins to recognize, or cleave, ISG15 conjugates in order to evade, or suppress, innate immunity, the impact of ISG15 biodiversity on deISGylating proteases of the ovarian tumor family (vOTU) from nairoviruses was evaluated. The enzymatic activities of vOTUs originating from the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Erve virus, and Nairobi sheep disease virus were tested against ISG15s from humans, mice, shrews, sheep, bats, and camels, which are mammalian species known to be infected by nairoviruses. This along with investigation of binding by isothermal titration calorimetry illustrated significant differences in the abilities of nairovirus deISGylases to accommodate certain species of ISG15. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of species preferences of these vOTUs, a structure was determined to 2.5 ? for a complex of Erve virus vOTU protease and a mouse ISG15 domain. This structure revealed the molecular basis of Erve virus vOTU's preference for ISG15 over Ub and the first structural insight into a nonhuman ISG15. This structure also revealed key interactions, or lack thereof, surrounding three amino acids that may drive a viral deISgylase to prefer an ISG15 from one species over that of another. IMPORTANCE Viral ovarian tumor domain proteases (vOTUs) are one of the two principal classes of viral proteases observed to reverse posttranslational modification of host proteins by ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15), subsequently facilitating downregulation of IFN-I signaling pathways. Unlike the case with ubiquitin, the amino acid sequences of ISG15s from various species are notably divergent. We illustrate that vOTUs have clear preferences for ISG15s from certain species. In addition, these observations are related to the molecular insights acquired via the first X-ray structure of the vOTU from the Erve nairovirus in complex with the first structurally resolved nonhuman ISG15. This information implicates certain amino acids that drive the preference of vOTUs for ISG15s from certain species.","output":"Biochemical and Structural Insights into the Preference of Nairoviral DeISGylases for Interferon-Stimulated Gene Product 15 Originating from Certain Species."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate adaptive strategies to robustly and optimally control the COVID-19 pandemic via social distancing measures based on the example of Germany. Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing that (1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, (2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures on the same level, and (3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.","output":"Robust and optimal predictive control of the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Results of previous studies suggest that renin-angiotensin system blockers might reduce the burden of diabetic retinopathy. We therefore designed the DIabetic REtinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) Programme to assess whether candesartan could reduce the incidence and progression of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes. METHODS Two randomised, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled trials were done in 309 centres worldwide. Participants with normotensive, normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetes without retinopathy were recruited to the DIRECT-Prevent 1 trial and those with existing retinopathy were recruited to DIRECT-Protect 1, and were assigned to candesartan 16 mg once a day or matching placebo. After 1 month, the dose was doubled to 32 mg. Investigators and participants were unaware of the treatment allocation status. The primary endpoints were incidence and progression of retinopathy and were defined as at least a two-step and at least a three-step increase on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale, respectively. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00252733 for DIRECT-Prevent 1 and NCT00252720 for DIRECT-Protect 1. FINDINGS 1421 participants (aged 18-50 years) were randomly assigned to candesartan (n=711) or to placebo (n=710) in DIRECT-Prevent 1, and 1905 (aged 18-55 years) to candesartan (n=951) or to placebo (n=954) in DIRECT-Protect 1. Incidence of retinopathy was seen in 178 (25%) participants in the candesartan group versus 217 (31%) in the placebo group. Progression of retinopathy occurred in 127 (13%) participants in the candesartan group versus 124 (13%) in the placebo group. Hazard ratio (HR for candesartan vs placebo) was 0.82 (95% CI 0.67-1.00, p=0.0508) for incidence of retinopathy and 1.02 (0.80-1.31, p=0.85) for progression of retinopathy. The post-hoc outcome of at least a three-step increase for incidence yielded an HR of 0.65 (0.48-0.87, p=0.0034), which was attenuated but still significant after adjustment for baseline characteristics (0.71, 0.53-0.95, p=0.046).

At that time, no consistent protocols existed for follow-up of discharged patients with COVID-19 from the William P Clements Jr University Hospital at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Simultaneously, medical students were suspended from in-person clinical activities to limit viral spread. In response to these events, a telemedicine elective was created to provide timely and high-quality telehealth follow-up for recently discharged patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The pilot team, consisting of several second-year through fourth-year medical students, developed a call script that included warning signs and symptoms, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for isolation and primary care physician referral information. Patients with COVID-19 discharged from the emergency department (ED) and inpatient services were identified and assigned to student callers. All patients were discussed with an attending physician, who was available if an acute issue arose. The elective also included education on the SBAR (situation, background, assessment, and recommendation) handover technique, telehealth education, updated COVID-19 literature and CDC guidelines. RESULTS: Improvement was noted in students ability to identify patients who required escalation of care, as seen by over 60% of patients who were advised to return to ED required hospital admission. Statistically significant improvement was observed in the students degree of feeling informed about the current state of COVID-19 and their degree of comfort with interviewing patients over the phone.

Methods: We conducted a nationwide anonymous cross-sectional online study in 2020 using a modified SeViD questionnaire including the BFI-10 (personality traits). Statistical analysis was conducted using chi2 tests and binary logistic regression models. Results: Of 332 nurses, 60% reported to experience SVP at least once a working lifetime, with a 12-month prevalence among SVP of 49%. Of the nurses, 24% reported recovery times of more than 1 year. In contrast to physicians from SeViD-I, a main cause for becoming a second victim was aggressive behavior by patients. High neuroticism values, higher age, and medium work life experience, but neither gender nor workplace position, were predisposing for SVP. Like SeViD-I, nurses reported demand for an institutional response in cases of SVP.

There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we develop a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model including an additional compartment of chronically infected individuals who can stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported generation time, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. Using the incidence and fatality data from different countries, we first show that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed prior to the easing of the lockdown measures (relaxation). We then test the predictive power of this model for different durations and levels of prolonged infectiousness using the incidence data after the introduction of relaxation in Switzerland, and compare it with a model without the chronically infected population to represent the models conventionally used. We show that in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures, the predictions of the model including the chronically infected population vary considerably from those obtained under a model in which prolonged infectiousness is not taken into account.

As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials. However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely reporting of overall clinical trial results on public registries or through academic publication. We aimed to analyse the evidence gap in this data by conducting a rapid review of results posting on ClinicalTrials.gov and in academic publications to quantify the number of trials missing results for drugs potentially being repurposed for COVID-19. METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by identifier (NCT number) and checked for results and for timely result reporting (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify publications of results not listed on the registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess reviewer concordance. RESULTS: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not post results on ClinicalTrials.gov or in the academic literature.

OBJECTIVE: This review aims to summarize initial clinical evidence for the role of TCM in COVID-19 treatment, discuss potential TCM and biological mechanisms, and suggest implications for practice and research. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar between December 2019 and January 2021. Observational studies, retrospective studies, case studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials with at least a published English abstract were inspected and included in the final review. RESULTS: In general, herbal medicine has been shown to improve clinical symptoms, patient prognosis and mortality, and inflammatory markers, especially when paired with Western medicine. Potential mechanisms of action involve bioactive compounds preventing the virus from binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 of the host cell, inhibiting viral replication after its penetration into the host cell, as well as counteracting the proinflammatory overreaction of the immune system. Other TCM modalities, including acupuncture and moxibustion, qigong, and tuina and acupressure for COVID-19 treatment have not been well investigated.

The quest to reduce SAH-associated brain injury and improve outcomes is shifting away from large vessel cerebral vasospasm to a new paradigm targeting multiple brain injury mechanisms, including early brain injury, delayed cerebral ischemia, microcirculatory dysfunction, spreading cortical depolarization, inflammation, and the brain-body interaction in vascular brain injury with critical illness.Despite multiple negative randomized clinical trials in search of potential therapeutic agents ameliorating the downstream effects after SAH, the overall outcome of SAH has improved over recent decades, likely related to improvements in interventional options for ruptured cerebral aneurysms and in critical care management. Emerging clinical evidence also suggests potential harmful impact of historic empiric treatments for SAH-associated vasospasm, such as prophylactic induction of hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (triple H therapy).With decreasing mortality, long-term SAH survivorship and efforts to reduce chronic morbidity and to improve quality of life and patient-centered outcome are growing areas of unmet need. Despite existing guidelines, significant variabilities in local and regional practices and in scientific terminologies have historically limited advancement in SAH care and therapeutic development. Large global collaborative efforts developed harmonized SAH common data elements in 2019, and studies are under way to examine how existing variabilities in SAH care impact long-term SAH outcomes. SUMMARY Although the overall incidence and mortality of SAH is decreasing with advances in preventive and acute care, SAH remains a major cause of long-term morbidity in survivors. Significant variabilities in care settings and empiric treatment protocols and inconsistent scientific terminologies have limited advancement in patient care and therapeutic clinical studies. Large consensus efforts are under way to introduce clinical guidelines and common data elements to advance therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcome.","output":"Subarachnoid Hemorrhage."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (hTRPV4) ion channel plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes.

Currently, the Delta versions of SARS-CoV-2 have become the prevalent strains in much of the world since it first appeared in India in late 2020. Researchers believe they have discovered why Delta has been so successful: those infected with it create significantly more virus than those infected with the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, making it extremely contagious. This has redirected the focus to how our immune system defends us from these various pathogens and initiates such varied responses. Hundreds of research papers have been published on the origins of long-lasting immune responses and disparities in the numbers of different immune cell types in COVID 19 survivors, but the primary architect of these discrepancies has yet to be discovered. In this essay, we will concentrate on the primary architect protein, activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which triggers molecular processes that allow our immune system to produce powerful antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells, allowing us to outwit the virus.

MeV is responsible for major morbidity and mortality in non-vaccinated populations. ERDRP-0519, a pan-morbillivirus small molecule inhibitor for the treatment of measles, targets the morbillivirus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRP) complex and displayed unparalleled oral efficacy against lethal infection of ferrets with CDV, an established surrogate model for human measles. Resistance profiling identified the L subunit of the RdRP, which harbors all enzymatic activity of the polymerase complex, as the molecular target of inhibition. Here, we examined binding characteristics, physical docking site, and the molecular mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 through label-free biolayer interferometry, photoaffinity cross-linking, and in vitro RdRP assays using purified MeV RdRP complexes and synthetic templates. Results demonstrate that unlike all other mononegavirus small molecule inhibitors identified to date, ERDRP-0519 inhibits all phosphodiester bond formation in both de novo initiation of RNA synthesis at the promoter and RNA elongation by a committed polymerase complex. Photocrosslinking and resistance profiling-informed ligand docking revealed that this unprecedented mechanism of action of ERDRP-0519 is due to simultaneous engagement of the L protein polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase)-like domain and the flexible intrusion loop by the compound, pharmacologically locking the polymerase in pre-initiation conformation. This study informs selection of ERDRP-0519 as clinical candidate for measles therapy and identifies a previously unrecognized druggable site in mononegavirus L polymerase proteins that can silence all synthesis of viral RNA.","output":"Therapeutic targeting of measles virus polymerase with ERDRP-0519 suppresses all RNA synthesis activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus)-CV-2 (2019-nCov), which showed up in China in December 2019 and spread all over the world, has becomed a serious health problem.

To deal with outbreaks of the pandemic, countries have been racing to develop vaccines and issue many regulations for people in daily life. Wearing a facemask in public is mandatory and will be severely punished if violated. In addition to those mandatory regulations, it is necessary to develop tools for early warning of those not wearing facemasks in public places such as offices, schools, supermarkets, train stations, etc. This paper proposes to build a facemask alert system based on a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) operating on low-computing devices. This system works in two stages: face detection and facemask classification. In the first stage, it uses a face detection network based on the main benefit of convolution, separable depthwise convolution, and double detectors layer to extract face RoI (Region of Interest). Then, this image area will go through a facemask classification network that exploits the advantages of convolution, separable depthwise convolution, and skip connection layers to classify facemask wearing (Mask or NoMask). The proposed networks are trained and evaluated on benchmark datasets.

In addition to the vast number of global mortalities due to COVID-19, since its outbreak, almost every aspect of human lives has changed one way or another. In the present review, various defensive and offensive strategies developed to confront COVID-19 are illustrated. The Administration of immune-boosting micronutrients/agents, as well as the inhibition of the activity of incompetent gatekeepers, including some host cell receptors (e.g. ACE2) and proteases (e.g. TMPRSS2), are some efficient defensive strategies. Antibody/phage therapies and specifically vaccines also play a prominent role in the enhancement of host defense against COVID-19. Nanotechnology, however, can considerably weaken the virulence of SARS-CoV-2, utilizing fake cellular locks (compounds mimicking cell receptors) to block the viral keys (spike proteins). Generally, two strategies are developed to interfere with the binding of spike proteins to the host cell receptors, either utilizing fake cellular locks to block the viral keys or utilizing fake viral keys to block the cellular locks. Due to their evolutionary conserved nature, viral enzymes, including 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp, and helicase are highly potential targets for drug repurposing strategy. Thus, various steps of viral replication/transcription can effectively be blocked by their inhibition, leading to the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, RNA decoy and CRISPR technologies likely offer the best offensive strategies after viral entry into the host cells, inhibiting the viral replication/assembly in the infected cells and substantially reducing the quantity of viral progeny.","output":"Reinforcing our defense or weakening the enemy?

In response to challenges with proning COVID-19 patients, the Apparatus and Method for Moving a Patient (AMMP) device was developed to facilitate the proning of patients while minimizing risk to the patient or the healthcare team. Using healthy participants as patient volunteers, this study sought to determine if the AMMP makes it easier, quicker, and safer to prone patients compared to using the standard approach. METHODS: In this preclinical feasibility study, healthy participants were recruited to participate as patient volunteers at 2 ICUs in Nova Scotia (QEII Health Sciences Centre, Cape Breton Regional Hospital). Education on how to use the AMMP was provided prior to performing the movements. Healthcare providers in the ICUs including physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists used the AMMP to move participants from supine to prone and vice versa, up/ down and/or to lateral position. Paper-based surveys were administered to patient volunteers and healthcare providers upon completion of the movements. RESULTS: In all, 10 patient volunteers and 23 healthcare providers completed surveys. The majority of volunteers were aged 18-35 years (7/10;70%) and weighed 61-90 kg (6/10;60%). None of the volunteers reported being injured while being repositioned using the AMMP, and none of the providers reported any strain or injury to a volunteer or to a team member. Among providers, 91.3% (21/23) felt the AMMP was easy to apply to patients, 100% (23/23) found it easy to adjust strap length, and 100% (23/23) found it was easy to remove after the movement was completed. Compared to prone positioning using the standard approach, 100% (23/23) providers felt that using the AMMP was safer for the healthcare team and 96% (22/23) felt it was safer for the patient. All providers (23/23;100%) agreed physical demands were reduced using the AMMP, and 96% (22/23) agreed it took less time to complete prone positioning and required fewer providers to prone and reposition the patient volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Volunteers felt comfortable and secure being proned and repositioned in the AMMP.

During 11 weeks of the influenza epidemic period in JanuaryCMarch 2012, consecutive adult patients suspected to be septic (n = 432) were analyzed with cultures from blood and nasopharynx plus multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses on the nasopharyngeal specimen. The results were compared with those from microbiology analyses ordered as part of standard care. During the winter season, viral respiratory pathogens, mainly influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were clinically underdiagnosed in 70% of patients positive by the multiplex PCR assay. During the first four weeks of the influenza epidemic, few tests for influenza were ordered by clinicians, indicating low awareness that the epidemic had started. Nasopharyngeal findings of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae by culture correlated to pneumonia diagnosis, and in those patients laboratory signs of viral co-infections were common but rarely suspected by clinicians. The role of respiratory viral infections in patients presenting with a clinical picture of sepsis is underestimated. Specific antiviral treatment might be beneficial in some cases and may reduce spread in a hospital setting. Diagnosing viral infections may promote reduction of unnecessary antibiotic use.

The respiratory tract is a target organ-system which can result in serious complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Management of this condition is more challenging in diabetes who developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Clinical Case: We report a case of a 59-year-old male who presented with 4 days of productive cough with blood-tinged sputum, shortness of breath, and chills. Patient had decreased oral intake and had not been compliant with his medication. He had underlying disease significant for type 2 diabetes, essential hypertension, obesity (BMI 32 kg/m2), history of pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis. His diabetes medications included insulin degludec 126 units with insulin lispro sliding scale, dulaglutide, metformin, and sitagliptin. On examination, the patient was lethargic. Initial vital signs included a temperature of 36.8C, respiratory rate 24/min, heart rate 65 bpm, BP 140/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 91% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral widespread crackles. Laboratory was significant for glucose 387 mg/dL (70C139), pH 7.25 (7.35-7.28), anion gap 15.8 mEq/L (6C14) and concurrent normal gap acidosis, urine ketones 15 mg/dL (negative), and LDH 325 U/L (140C171). An initial chest x-ray showed bilateral peripheral pulmonary infiltrates. Workup was negative for influenza, pneumococcus, and legionella. The patient was subsequently intubated on the first day for worsening hypoxia due to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 71). He was concomitantly treated for DKA and hypotension with intravenous insulin, initially started at 12 units/hour with subsequent titration down to average of 5 units/hour, fluid resuscitation (approximate 34 ml/kg actual body weight) and, potassium repletion on the first day. On the same day, his hypoxia worsened with an increase in pulmonary infiltrates, so we stopped intravenous fluids and initiated norepinephrine for 24 hours. His mechanical ventilation settings followed ARDS guidelines. Positive COVID-19 was detected from real-time RT-PCR. After maintaining a negative fluid balance, we were able to extubate in 72 hours. Intravenous insulin was continued for 46 hours then was switched to subcutaneous basal-bolus regimen. He was discharged with insulin degludec 100 units with insulin lispro sliding scale, metformin, and sitagliptin. Dulaglutide was held. Conclusion: Type 2 diabetes are rarely affected by DKA but can be found in up to 27% of the cases. There are reports of ARDS as a serious complication in severe DKA in adults and children, yet no data for concomitant DKA and ARDS has been published. We propose that the management of DKA in COVID-19 patients with ARDS may be similar to the paradigm utilized for other volume restriction in patients with congestive heart failure and end-stage renal failure.","output":"A Case of Concomitant COVID-19 Infection-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Another Challenge in Fluid Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still threatening humankind. Despite first successes in vaccine development and approval, no antiviral treatment is available for COVID-19 patients. The success is further tarnished by the emergence and spreading of mutation variants of SARS-CoV-2, for which some vaccines have lower efficacy. This highlights the urgent need for antiviral therapies even more.

We confirmed the initially identified guanylate kinase as a potential antiviral target with this refined model and identified further potential targets from the purine and pyrimidine metabolism. The model was further extended by incorporating the virus' lipid requirements. This opened new perspectives for potential antiviral targets in the altered lipid metabolism. Especially the phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis seems to play a pivotal role in viral replication. The guanylate kinase is even a robust target in all investigated mutation variants currently spreading worldwide. These new insights can guide laboratory experiments for the validation of identified potential antiviral targets.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 21 COVID-19 readmitted patients initially admitted between 3/10/2020 and 4/20/2020 (early 0C7, late 8C30 days) was done.

Univariate and logistic regression analysis were performed to study the risk factors associated with early readmission and worsening of COVID-19 pneumonia. Secondary analyses were performed comparing worsening COVID-19 pneumonia with other readmission diagnoses. RESULTS: 4.6% (21/455) were readmitted, 14 early vs 7 late (median age 75 vs 65 yrs). Most early readmissions were COVID-19 related and 8 out of 14 had worsening COVID-19 pneumonia based on clinical picture, laboratory and imaging findings. Readmitted patients with worsening COVID-19 related pneumonia had significantly elevated CRP and lower ALC compared to last discharge value (Table 1). None of the late readmissions required MP. A total of 8 readmissions had bacterial coinfections (1/8 COVID-19 related) (Table 2). Bacterial infections unrelated to COVID-19 were aspiration pneumonia (2), urinary tract infection (2), enterococcal bacteremia from stercoral colitis (1), sacral osteomyelitis (1), and infected BKA stump (1).

Current guidelines recommend the addition of the tocilizumab to dexamethasone in critically ill patients. In randomized trials, the use of tocilizumab was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of secondary infections but concerns remain. STUDY QUESTION: Do patients with severe COVID pneumonia treated with tocilizumab experienced high rates of secondary infection. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective electronic chart review of patients with COVID pneumonia who received tocilizumab and dexamethasone (n = 62) from January 2021 to October 2021 and compared them with a cohort of patients (n = 49) who received only dexamethasone and admitted from July 2020 to December 2020 (before institutional use of tocilizumab). Patients received tocilizumab only if they had acute hypoxic respiratory failure and were felt to be clinically worsening. Patients were deemed to have a secondary infection only if a diagnosis of infection was confirmed via positive cultures. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients received tocilizumab; of which, 30 (45.5%) subsequently had culture-positive secondary infections compared with 24.5% of controls. Thirty-one patients (47.0%) who received tocilizumab died by the time of analysis, 14 (45.2%) of whom had a secondary infection. Gram-negative bacterial infections predominated, followed by fungal infections. Patients who received tocilizumab had over twice as many gram-negative pneumonias (30.3% vs. 14.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe COVID pneumonia treated with tocilizumab experienced high rates of secondary infection. Although the benefit of tocilizumab in reducing mortality is well-established and almost certainly outweighs secondary infection risks, we question if the \\"real-world\\" infection rates are much higher than those reported in trials or if the infection risk could be mitigated with dose reductions in tocilizumab without losing the mortality benefit. Further study into the infection risk, and risk-benefit analysis of dose adjustments, of tocilizumab in the critical care setting is warranted.","output":"Secondary Infection Risk in Patients With Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Treated With Tocilizumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT It has been documented that the older adults of the population are at the greatest risk of mortality due to the coronavirus disease;consequently, they could be the population most affected by the measures of social isolation and reduction of virus contagion implemented worldwide Social isolation can expose older adults to an increased nutritional risk due to factors such as socioeconomic insecurity, which could affect food acquisition and the need for support in daily tasks and meals The institutionalized older adults often depend on food donations, which may have reduced due the economic crisis caused by the pandemic, and the aging process itself causes changes in nutritional necessitie and eating habits In the coronavirus pandemic, nutritionists and dietitians can offer remote nutritional follow-up Moreover, the government actions, such as the implementation of educational and social service programs, should be applied to support healthy aging and minimize exposure to nutritional risks and coronavirus disease RESUMO Tem sido documentado que os idosos s?o a populao de maior risco para mortalidade por COVID-19 Consequentemente, pode ser a mais afetada pelas medidas de isolamento social e de reduo de contgio pelo vrus implementadas em todo o mundo O isolamento social pode expor os idosos ao risco nutricional aumentado devido a alguns fatores, como: a inseguran?a socioecon?mica, a qual pode afetar a aquisio de alimentos;a necessidade de apoio nas tarefas e nas refeies dirias;a possvel reduo de doaes de alimentos para idosos institucionalizados, em virtude da crise econ?mica ocasionada pela pandemia;e o prprio processo do envelhecimento, que causa alteraes das necessidades nutricionais e do hbito de se alimentar Contudo, no contexto da pandemia do novo coronavrus, nutricionistas podem oferecer acompanhamento nutricional remoto Alm disso, aes governamentais, como a implementao de programas educacionais e de servi?o social, devem ser aplicadas para o envelhecimento saudvel e para a minimizao da exposio ao risco nutricional e  COVID-19","output":"Nutritional challenges in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to determine the specific cytokine profile in peripheral blood during the early onset of COVID-19 infection.

Determining distributions of inputs typically requires additional human effort in terms of histogram-fitting and running a goodness-of-fit test, which is avoided here. The new approximation is tested on a variety of scenarios and its performance is benchmarked against simulation. Further, the new approximation is also implemented on a ventilator case study from the recent COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate its utility in optimizing server capacity.

Respiratory droplets are known to be the most prominent source of transmission for COVID-19, however, alternative routes may exist given the discovery of small numbers of viable viruses in urine and stool samples. Flushing biomatter can lead to the aerosolization of microorganisms, thus, there is a likelihood that bioaerosols generated in public restrooms may pose a concern for the transmission of COVID-19, especially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot traffic, and may suffer from inadequate ventilation. To quantify the extent of aerosolization, we measure the size and number of droplets generated by flushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom. The results indicate that the particular designs tested in the study generate a large number of droplets in the size range 0.3$\\\\mu m$ to 3$\\\\mu m$, which can reach heights of at least 1.52m. Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them completely, suggesting that aerosolized droplets escaped through small gaps between the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol levels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol levels due to the accumulation of droplets from multiple flushes conducted during the tests. This highlights the need for incorporating adequate ventilation in the design and operation of public spaces, which can help prevent aerosol accumulation in high occupancy areas and mitigate the risk of airborne disease transmission.","output":"Aerosol generation in public restrooms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The psychological impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on cancer patients, a population at higher risk of fatal consequences if infected, has been only rarely evaluated.

DESIGN: This was a multicentre retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: The medical records generated in three temporary military hospitals in Wuhan. PARTICIPANTS: Medical records of 2702 inpatients generated from 5 February to 5 April 2020 were randomly selected for this study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: DWs of COVID-19 symptoms were determined by the person trade-off approach. The inpatients' medical records were analysed and used to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The mean DALY was evaluated across sex and age groups. The relationship between DALY and age, sex, body mass index, length of hospital stay, symptom duration before admission and native place was determined by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: For the DALY of each inpatient, severe expiratory dyspnoea, mild cough and sore throat had the highest (0.399) and lowest (0.004) weights, respectively. The average synthetic DALY and daily DALY were 2.291.33 and 0.180.15 days, respectively. Fever and fatigue contributed the most DALY at 31.36%, whereas nausea and vomiting and anxiety and depression contributed the least at 7.05%. There were significant differences between sex and age groups in both synthetic and daily DALY. Age, body mass index, length of hospital stay and symptom duration before admission were strongly related to both synthetic and daily DALY.

We aimed to determine the frequency of long-term exercise capacity limitation in survivors of severe COVID-19 pulmonary infection and the factors associated with this limitation. METHODS: Patients with severe COVID-19 pulmonary infection were enrolled 3 months after hospital discharge in COVulnerability, a prospective cohort. They underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing, pulmonary function test, echocardiography, and skeletal muscle mass evaluation. RESULTS: Among 105 patients included, 35% had a reduced exercise capacity (VO(2)peak < 80% of predicted). Compared to patients with a normal exercise capacity, patients with reduced exercise capacity were more often men (89.2% vs. 67.6%, p = 0.015), with diabetes (45.9% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.002) and renal dysfunction (21.6% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.006), but did not differ in terms of initial acute disease severity. An altered exercise capacity was associated with an impaired respiratory function as assessed by a decrease in forced vital capacity (p < 0.0001), FEV1 (p < 0.0001), total lung capacity (p < 0.0001) and DL(CO) (p = 0.015). Moreover, we uncovered a decrease of muscular mass index and grip test in the reduced exercise capacity group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.047 respectively), whilst 38.9% of patients with low exercise capacity had a sarcopenia, compared to 10.9% in those with normal exercise capacity (p = 0.001). Myocardial function was normal with similar systolic and diastolic parameters between groups whilst reduced exercise capacity was associated with a slightly shorter pulmonary acceleration time, despite no pulmonary hypertension.

Most interventions available to these spouses do not match their need for tailored and flexible psychosocial support. Therefore, tailored content for spouses of persons with FTD was recently incorporated in the proven effective and web-based Partner in Balance intervention. METHODS: This feasibility study prospectively evaluated the tailored Partner in Balance content for spouses of persons with FTD. Spouses followed the 8-week intervention, and qualitative and quantitative measures were used to evaluate expectations and barriers prior to participation and aspects of usability, feasibility, and acceptability of content. Additionally, effects were explored regarding caregiver self-efficacy, sense of mastery, stress, depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Twenty-seven spouses caring for a spouse with FTD at home started the intervention. Eventually, 20 completed the intervention (74.1%). Partner in Balance matched the expectations of participating spouses and helped them to find a better balance between caregiving and personal life, acquire more peace of mind, and facilitated coping with behavioral and communication difficulties. Before participation, time restraints were identified as a potential barrier, but afterwards spouses positively evaluated the flexibility of the web-based approach that allowed them to participate at a convenient time and place. They valued the recognizability of the videos and narrative stories on FTD. Post-intervention, spouses qualitatively felt more confident, more at ease, and strengthened as a caregiver.

Vahl) usually used to treat inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the therapeutic effect of FSE on liver fibrosis. AIM OF THE STUDY The purpose of our study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of FSE on liver fibrosis and reveal the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS Liver fibrosis model was established by subcutaneous injection of olive oil containing 40% CCl4. Rat liver tissue morphologic pathology was investigated by using HE staining, Masson staining and Sirius red staining. Several biochemical markers including liver (ALT, AST, AKP, -GT), fibrosis (HA, LN, PC III, Col IV) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-1, TNF-) were determined by using Elisa kits. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the distribution of -SMA and COL1 in liver tissue. Effects of FSE on inflammatory pathway (TLR4/MyD88/NF-B) and fibrotic pathway (TGF-/smads) were detected by western blot and qPCR. RESULTS The results showed that hepatic histopathological injury, abnormal liver function, fibrosis and inflammation induced by CCl4 were improved by FSE (2.5, 5 g/kg). Immunohistochemistry and western blot results indicated that the expression of -SMA and COL1 in liver tissue was inhibited by FSE (2.5, 5 g/kg). Western blot and qPCR results further proved that FSE (2.5, 5 g/kg) inhibited the transduction of TLR4/MyD88/NF-B and TGF-/smads signaling pathways.

To assess potential for off-target toxicity, RDV was evaluated in a set of cellular and biochemical assays. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in a set of relevant human cell lines and primary cells. In addition, RDV was evaluated for mitochondrial toxicity under aerobic and anaerobic metabolic conditions, and for the effects on mitochondrial DNA content, mitochondrial protein synthesis, cellular respiration, and induction of reactive oxygen species. Lastly, the active 5'-triphosphate metabolite of RDV, GS-443902, was evaluated for potential interaction with human DNA and RNA polymerases. Among all of the human cells tested under 5-14 days of continuous exposure, RDV's CC50 values ranged from 1.7 to >20 M, resulting in selectivity indices (SI, CC50/EC50) from >170 to 20,000, with respect to RDV anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (EC50 of 9.9 nM in human airway epithelial cells).

Type I interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in antiviral immunity. In the present study, we demonstrated that infection with the highly pathogenic PRRSV strain JXwn06 antagonized type I IFN expression induced by poly(IC) in both porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and blood monocyte-derived macrophages (BMo). Subsequently, we showed that the inhibition of poly(IC)-induced IFN- production by PRRSV was dependent on the blocking of NF-B signaling pathways. By screening PRRSV nonstructural and structural proteins, we demonstrated that nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4), a viral 3C-like serine protease, significantly suppressed IFN- expression. Moreover, we verified that nsp4 inhibited NF-B activation induced by signaling molecules, including RIG-I, VISA, TRIF, and IKK. nsp4 was shown to target the NF-B essential modulator (NEMO) at the E349-S350 site to mediate its cleavage. Importantly, nsp4 mutants with defective protease activity abolished its ability to cleave NEMO and inhibit IFN- production. These findings might have implications for our understanding of PRRSV pathogenesis and its mechanisms for evading the host immune response. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a major agent of respiratory diseases in pigs. Like many other viruses, PRRSV has evolved a variety of strategies to evade host antiviral innate immunity for survival and propagation. In this study, we show that PRRSV nsp4 is a novel antagonist of the NF-B signaling pathway, which is responsible for regulating the expression of type I interferons and other crucial cytokines. We then investigated the underlying mechanism used by nsp4 to suppress NF-B-mediated IFN- production. We found that nsp4 interfered with the NF-B signaling pathway through the cleavage of NEMO (a key regulator of NF-B signaling) at the E349-S350 site, leading to the downregulation of IFN- production induced by poly(IC). The data presented here may help us to better understand PRRSV pathogenesis.","output":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nonstructural protein 4 antagonizes beta interferon expression by targeting the NF-B essential modulator."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health has long fallen behind physical health in attention, funding, and actionespecially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It has been conspicuously absent from global reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (MNCAH) programming, despite increasing awareness of the intergenerational impact of common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs). However, the universal health coverage (UHC) movement and COVID-19 have brought mental health to the forefront, and the MNCAH community is looking to understand how to provide women effective, sustainable care at scale. To address this, MOMENTUM Country and Global Leadership (MCGL) commissioned a landscape analysis in December 2020 to assess the state of CPMDs and identify what is being done to address the burden in LMICs. METHODS: The landscape analysis (LA) used a multitiered approach. First, reviewers chose a scoping review methodology to search literature in PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychInfo, and Scopus. Titles and abstracts were reviewed before a multidisciplinary team conducted data extraction and analysis on relevant articles. Second, 44 key informant interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted with mental health, MNCAH, humanitarian, nutrition, gender-based violence (GBV), advocacy, and implementation research experts. Finally, reviewers completed a document analysis of relevant mental health policies from 19 countries. RESULTS: The LA identified risk factors for CPMDs, maternal mental health interventions and implementation strategies, and remaining knowledge gaps. Risk factors included social determinants, such as economic or gender inequality, and individual experiences, such as stillbirth. Core components identified in successful perinatal mental health (PMH) interventions at community level included stepped care, detailed context assessments, task-sharing models, and talk therapy; at health facility level, they included pre-service training on mental health, trained and supervised providers, referral and assessment processes, mental health support for providers, provision of respectful care, and linkages with GBV services. Yet, significant gaps remain in understanding how to address CPMDs. CONCLUSION: These findings illuminate an urgent need to provide CPMD prevention and care to women in LMICs. The time is long overdue to take perinatal mental health seriously. Efforts should strive to generate better evidence while implementing successful approaches to help millions of women suffering in silence.

For instance, the genetic homology of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is 80% and 50%, respectively, which may cause similar clinical features. Moreover, uncontrolled release of proinflammatory mediators (also called a cytokine storm) by activated immune cells in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 patients leads to severe phenotype development. Aim: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the inflammatory cytokine profile associated with three strains of severe human coronavirus diseases (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Method: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies published until July 2020. Randomized and observational studies reporting the inflammatory cytokines associated with severe and non-severe human coronavirus diseases, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, were included. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval to estimate the pooled mean of inflammatory biomarkers. Results: A high level of circulating IL-6 could be associated with the severity of infection of the three coronavirus strains. TNF, IL-10, and IL-8 are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Increased circulating levels of CXCL10/IP10 and CCL2/MCP-1 might also be related to the severity of MERS. Conclusion: This study suggests that the immune response and immunopathology in the three severe human coronavirus strains are somewhat similar. The findings highlight that nearly all studies reporting severe cases of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have been associated with elevated levels of IL-6.

Although multiple safe and effective vaccines and some pharmaceuticals have been approved for use, the problem is still unsolved for individuals with underlying medical conditions and those living in underserved areas that lack vaccines and/or an adequate medical infrastructure. This is especially challenging as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge. One possible approach to solving this problem lies in using naturally abundant phytochemicals generally regarded as safe that bind to and disrupt SARS-CoV-2. When used in conjunction with a polypharmacological approach, targeting multiple essential viral proteins can lead to stronger functional inhibition and provides a safeguard against escape mutations. Although finding the proper phytochemicals to accomplish a specific therapeutic task is challenging and costly, in-silico screening methods have made this a more tractable problem by expediting the initial lead compound discovery phase. Recent studies have gained mechanistic insights of drug interactions through computational docking against select SARS-CoV-2 proteins, yet several viral proteins remain unexplored as druggable targets. Here we investigate a wide range of drug products against a comprehensive array of SARS CoV-2 proteins using a high-resolution docking workflow. Our initial lead compound discovery phase consisted of a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) wherein 10 types of structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins were computationally docked against a panel of anti-viral phytochemicals from the USDA Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases. In the second phase of the study, we employed ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) by extracting chemical features of 34 lead compounds from the SBVS using unsupervised clustering based on common motifs. Features among dominant ligand clusters were then used to prioritize subsets of additional phytochemical databases for drug discovery. Among the 53 newly identified phytochemicals generated via LBVS, high-resolution docking predicted that 28 elicit strong binding interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Thus, the inclusion of LBVS resulted in a 4-fold increase in the rate of lead discovery. Finally, drug-likeness of all lead compounds and phytochemical sourcing was evaluated. As a result, this three-phase workflow gave rise to 18 flavone, alkaloid, and anthraquinone phytochemicals with the greatest potential for therapeutic utility. Among these phytochemicals, multiple lead compounds with favorable drug-likeness can be derived from individual plants (e.g. Camptotheca acuminata and Mahonia japonica). Collectively, this study demonstrates the exciting potential of plant-based drug development for COVID-19 prevention and treatment using a polypharmacological approach. These findings further support the advantage of incorporating machine learning elements into a virtual screening workflow.","output":"Phytochemical Drug Discovery for COVID-19 Using High-resolution Computational Docking and Machine Learning Assisted Binder Prediction (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inadequate physical activity is currently one of the leading risk factors for mortality worldwide.

Current therapies are focused on the treatment of inflammation; however, there is an urgent need for innovative therapies promoting neuroregeneration, particularly myelin repair. It is demonstrated that testosterone can act through neural androgen receptors and several clinical observations stimulated an interest in the potential protective effects of testosterone treatment for MS. Here, we sought to demonstrate the effects of a testosterone supplementation in testosterone-deficient men with relapsing-remitting MS. METHODS/DESIGN: This report presents the rationale and methodology of TOTEM RRMS, a French, phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial, which aims to prevent the progression of MS in men with low testosterone levels by administration of testosterone undecanoate, who were kept under natalizumab (Tysabri?) to overcome the anti-inflammatory effect of testosterone. Forty patients will be randomized into two groups receiving either a testosterone treatment (Nebido?) or a matching placebo. The intervention period for each group will last 66 weeks (treatment will be injected at baseline, week 6, and then every 12 weeks). The main objective is to determine the neuroprotective and remyelinating effects of testosterone using tensor diffusion imaging techniques and thalamic atrophy analyses. As secondary objectives, impacts of the testosterone supplementation will be studied using other conventional and unconventional MRI parameters and with clinical outcomes. DISCUSSION: The action of testosterone is observed in different experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models and epidemiological studies in humans. However, despite several preclinical data and some small clinical trials in MS, clear evidence for a therapeutic effect of hormone therapy is still missing. Therefore, our goal is to demonstrate the effects of testosterone therapies in MS. As there is no effective treatment currently available on fatigue in MS, careful attention should also be paid to secondary endpoints: fatigue, cognitive functions, and other symptoms that may improve life quality. Assuming a positive outcome of the trial, this treatment could be considered as a new neuroprotective and remyelinating therapy in relapsing-remitting MS and could be applicable to other demyelinating diseases.

Data were analyzed from May 1 to July 31, 2021. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cancer service volumes from the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, defined as April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, were compared with volumes during a prepandemic period of April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: During the first year of the pandemic, there were a total of 4 476 693 cancer care services, compared with 5 644 105 services in the year prior, a difference of 20.7% fewer services of cancer care, representing a potential backlog of 1 167 412 cancer services. While there were less pronounced changes in systemic treatments, emergency and urgent imaging examinations (eg, 1.9% more parenteral systemic treatments) and surgical procedures (eg, 65% more urgent surgical procedures), major reductions were observed for most services beginning in March 2020. Compared with the year prior, during the first pandemic year, cancer screenings were reduced by 42.4% (?1 016 181 screening tests), cancer treatment surgical procedures by 14.1% (?8020 procedures), and radiation treatment visits by 21.0% (?141 629 visits). Biopsies to confirm cancer decreased by up to 41.2% and surgical cancer resections by up to 27.8% during the first pandemic wave. New consultation volumes also decreased, such as for systemic treatment (?8.2%) and radiation treatment (?9.3%). The use of virtual cancer care increased for systemic treatment and radiation treatment and psychosocial oncological care visits, increasing from 0% to 20% of total new or follow-up visits prior to the pandemic up to 78% of total visits in the first pandemic year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, large reductions in cancer service volumes were observed. While most services recovered to prepandemic levels at the end of the first pandemic year, a substantial care deficit likely accrued. The anticipated downstream morbidity and mortality associated with this deficit underscore the urgent need to address the backlog and recover cancer care and warrant further study.","output":"Delivery of Cancer Care in Ontario, Canada, During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The optimum duration of antimicrobial treatment for patients with bacteremia is unknown. Our objectives were to determine duration of antimicrobial treatment provided to patients who have bacteremia in ICUs, to assess pathogen/patient factors related to treatment duration, and to assess the relationship between treatment duration and survival. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS Fourteen ICUs across Canada. PATIENTS Patients with bacteremia and were present in the ICU at the time culture reported positive. INTERVENTIONS Duration of antimicrobial treatment for patients who had bacteremia in ICU. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Among 1,202 ICU patients with bacteremia, the median duration of treatment was 14 days, but with wide variability (interquartile range, 9-17.5). Most patient characteristics were not associated with treatment duration. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the only pathogens associated with shorter treatment (odds ratio, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.51-5.26). The urinary tract was the only source of infection associated with a trend toward lower likelihood of shorter treatment (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42-1.08); an unknown source of infection was associated with a greater likelihood of shorter treatment (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.17-3.91). The association of treatment duration and survival was unstable when analyzed based on timing of death. CONCLUSIONS Critically ill patients who have bacteremia typically receive long courses of antimicrobials. Most patient/pathogen characteristics are not associated with treatment duration; survivor bias precludes a valid assessment of the association between treatment duration and survival. A definitive randomized controlled trial is needed to compare shorter versus longer antimicrobial treatment in patients who have bacteremia.","output":"Duration of Antimicrobial Treatment for Bacteremia in Canadian Critically Ill Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: COVID-19 forced the shutdown of colleges and socialization around the world including India and prolonged lockdown could have a significant impact on sleep, mood, emotion and anxiety in students. Here, we designed a survey to assess the effect of lockdown on sleepCwake, self-esteem, depression and anxiety via the survey on 321 Indian college-going students. METHODS: We assessed the effect of lockdown on sleepCwake (wake up, get up, bed and sleep timing, total time in bed and sleep duration) and self-esteem and depression on students via various questions. RESULTS: We found that students delayed sleep timing by 1 h in lockdown than pre-lockdown days. Specifically, urban male populations were late sleeper than any other group. However, total sleep duration did not differ between groups. In self-esteem questions, most students agreed that they were of no good, felt nervous, displeased, and frustrated about performance in lockdown. Depression and anxiety questionnaire gave more significant results related to mood and mental health. More than 50% of students agreed that they faced a lack of concentration, had been feeling irritated and angry, felt fatigued and tired, and everything had been a failure during lockdown days. CONCLUSION: Overall, the survey suggests that lack of social life and prolonged lockdown affect the sleepCwake cycle, self-esteem, anxiety and depression of Indian students.

To address these questions, we determined the structure of an 80S-like ribosome assembly intermediate to an overall resolution of 3.4 ?. The structure, validated by biochemical data, resolves a large body of previously paradoxical data and illustrates how assembly and translation factors cooperate to promote the formation of an interface that lacks many mature subunit contacts but is stabilized by the universally conserved methyltransferase Dim1. We also show how Tsr1 enables this interface by blocking the canonical binding of eIF5B to 40S subunits, while maintaining its binding to 60S. The structure also shows how this interface leads to unfolding of the platform, which allows for temporal regulation of the ATPase Fap7, thus linking 40S maturation to quality control during ribosome assembly.","output":"An open interface in the pre-80S ribosome coordinated by ribosome assembly factors Tsr1 and Dim1 enables temporal regulation of Fap7"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review: Albumin administration is recommended to prevent or treat specific complications of decompensated cirrhosis based on its capacity to expand plasma volume. However, the molecule also has many other biological properties that are unrelated to the oncotic activity. The purpose of this review is to examine the hemodynamic and systemic effects of albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Recent Findings: Besides plasma expansion, albumin appears to act against inflammation, facilitate immunocompetence, and improve cardiac and endothelial function, thus antagonizing critical steps in the pathophysiological cascade underlying decompensated cirrhosis. Summary: Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, as well the pleiotropic properties of the molecule, provides the rationale for considering albumin as a multi-target disease-modifying agent in decompensated cirrhosis.

Here I critically discuss research advocating this proposal, introduce a distinction between two types of detection of demographic diversity, and apply this distinction to the theorizing on diversity in science. Focusing on invisible diversity (i.e., differences in, e.g., LGBTQ+, religious, or political orientation), I argue that in one common kind of group in science, if group members have full insight into their groups diversity, this is likely to create epistemic costs. These costs can be avoided and epistemic benefits gained if group members only partly detect their groups diversity. There is thus an epistemic reason for context-dependent limitations on scientists insight into the diversity of their group.","output":"Hidden figures: epistemic costs and benefits of detecting (invisible) diversity in science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, emergency departments (ED) across the country have seen a significant decrease in patient visits. We aim to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on ED visits for acute otolaryngologic complaints in New York City, one of the first epicenters of the pandemic in the US. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients who presented to the ED with a primary diagnosis of an acute otolaryngologic complaint between March 1 and May 31 in 2019 and 2020. This was a multicenter study, including two tertiary care hospital systems encompassing Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, and Long Island. RESULTS: A total of 10,162 patients were identified. Significantly fewer patients presented to the ED for acute otolaryngologic complaints in 2020 (7332 vs 2830, p < 0.001). The rate of total otolaryngology-related ED visits was decreased by a factor of 0.635 (95% CI 0.6079 to 0.6634). In a subgroup analysis of each individual diagnosis, there was a significant decrease in rate of ED visits for 13 out of 18 diagnoses, including for life-threatening conditions, such as anaphylaxis. There was no significant difference based on which borough in New York City. Pediatric patients (age 0-17) were more significantly impacted by the pandemic compared to other age groups. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction in the utilization of ED for acute otolaryngologic complaints, including those requiring emergent management, and an even more significant reduction in the pediatric population.

Recently, there has been an increase in demand for technology that can reliably monitor respiration, which can be indicative of cardiac diseases, asthma, and infection by respiratory viruses. However, to date, the most reliable respiration monitoring system involves a tightly worn chest belt that is not conducive to longitudinal monitoring. Herein, we report that accurate respiration monitoring can be effected using a fabric-based humidity sensor mounted within a face mask. Our humidity sensor is created using cotton fabrics coated with a persistently p-doped conjugated polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):chloride (PEDOT-Cl), using a previously reported chemical vapor deposition process. The vapor-deposited polymer coating displays a stable, rapid, and reversible change in conductivity with an increase in local humidity, such as the humidity changes experienced within a face mask as the wearer breathes. Thus, when integrated into a face mask, the PEDOT-Cl-coated cotton humidity sensor is able to transduce breaths into an electrical signal. The humidity sensor-incorporated face mask is able to differentiate between deep and shallow breathing, as well as breathing versus talking. The sensor-incorporated face mask platform also functions both while walking and sitting, providing equally high signal quality in both indoor and outdoor contexts. Additionally, we show that the face mask can be worn for long periods of time with a negligible decline in the signal quality.","output":"Enabling Longitudinal Respiration Monitoring Using Vapor-Coated Conducting Textiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structure learning offers an expressive, versatile and explainable approach to causal and mechanistic modeling of complex biological data.

However, the optimal respiratory support method is still under debate. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of various respiratory support methods used for preventive purposes after scheduled extubation in critically ill medical patients. METHODS: A systematic database search was performed from inception to December 19, 2019, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a preventive use of different respiratory support methods, including conventional oxygen therapy (COT), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT), and combinational use of HFOT and NIV (HFOT+NIV), after planned extubation in adult critically ill medical patients. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments were performed in duplicate. The primary outcomes included re-intubation rate and short-term mortality. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs comprising 3341 participants with 4 comparisons were included. Compared with COT, NIV significantly reduced the re-intubation rate [risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.77; moderate quality of evidence] and short-term mortality (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91; moderate quality of evidence). Compared to COT, HFOT had a beneficial effect on the re-intubation rate (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.86; moderate quality of evidence) but no effect on short-term mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.12; low quality of evidence). No significant difference in the re-intubation rate or short-term mortality was found among NIV, HFOT, and HFOT+NIV. The treatment rankings based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) from best to worst for re-intubation rate were HFOT+NIV (95.1%), NIV (53.4%), HFOT (51.2%), and COT (0.3%), and the rankings for short-term mortality were NIV (91.0%), HFOT (54.3%), HFOT+NIV (43.7%), and COT (11.1%). Sensitivity analyses of trials with a high risk of extubation failure for the primary outcomes indicated that the SUCRA rankings were comparable to those of the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: After scheduled extubation, the preventive use of NIV is probably the most effective respiratory support method for comprehensively preventing re-intubation and short-term death in critically ill medical patients, especially those with a high risk of extubation failure.","output":"Preventive use of respiratory support after scheduled extubation in critically ill medical patientsa network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats provide key ecosystem services such as crop pest regulation, pollination, seed dispersal, and soil fertilization.

In Central Europe it is mainly caused by zoophilic dermatophytes, as for example Microsporum (M.) canis or Trichophyton (T.) mentagrophytes, and increasingly by anthropophilic fungi. T. tonsurans was commonly related to the Tinea gladiatorum, where transmission occurred between infected persons or via contaminated floors. OBJECTIVE Reporting the transmission of this highly contagious dermatophyte for the first time via beard shaving and hairdressing in barber shops in Germany.

We prepared a human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) cancer vaccine, by conjugating the HER2-derived CH401 epitope to the external surface of Physalis mottle virus (PhMV)-like particles via copper-free click chemistry. Another candidate was prepared by loading Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists as adjuvant into the interior cavity of PhMV-CH401although the addition of the adjuvant conferred no additional immune priming. The VLP-based anti-HER2 vaccine candidate was administered subcutaneously, using a prime-boost immunization schedule and BALB/c mice. The vaccine candidate elicited a strong immune response, including high titers of HER2-specific immunoglobulins and increased the toxicity of antisera to DDHER2 tumor cells. DDHER2 tumor challenge studies demonstrated efficacy, as evident from the delayed onset of tumor growth and the prolonged survival of the vaccinated vs. na?ve BALB/C mice. ABSTRACT: To develop a human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-specific cancer vaccine, using a plant virus-like particle (VLP) platform. Copper-free click chemistry and infusion encapsulation protocols were developed to prepare VLPs displaying the HER2-derived CH401 peptide epitope, with and without Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists loaded into the interior cavity of the VLPs; Physalis mottle virus (PhMV)-based VLPs were used. After prime-boost immunization of BALB/c mice through subcutaneous administration of the vaccine candidates, sera were collected and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the CH401-specific antibodies; Th1 vs. Th2 bias was determined by antibody subtyping and splenocyte assay. Efficacy was assessed by tumor challenge using DDHER2 tumor cells. We successful developed two VLP-based anti-HER2 vaccine candidatesPhMV-CH401 vs. CpG-PhMV-CH401; however, the addition of the CpG adjuvant did not confer additional immune priming. Both VLP-based vaccine candidates elicited a strong immune response, including high titers of HER2-specific immunoglobulins and increased toxicity of antisera to DDHER2 tumor cells. DDHER2 tumor growth was delayed, leading to prolonged survival of the vaccinated vs. na?ve BALB/C mice. The PhMV-based anti-HER2 vaccine PhMV-CH401, demonstrated efficacy as an anti-HER2 cancer vaccine.

Smart access control gates which utilize identity verification or the secure login to personal electronic gadgets may utilize face as a biometric trait. Particularly, the Covid-19 pandemic increasingly validates the essentiality of hygienic and contactless identity verification. In such cases, the usage of masks become more inevitable and performing attribute prediction helps in segregating the target vulnerable groups from community spread or ensuring social distancing for them in a collaborative environment. We create a masked face dataset by efficiently overlaying masks of different shape, size and textures to effectively model variability generated by wearing mask. This paper presents a deep Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approach to jointly estimate various heterogeneous attributes from a single masked facial image.

Data are limited on the use and benefit of tracheostomies for intubated, critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. During the surge in COVID 19 infections in metropolitan New York/New Jersey, our hospital cared for many COVID-19 patients who required prolonged intubation. This study describes the outcomes in COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy. METHODS: We present a case series of patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy at a single institution. Tracheostomies were performed on patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation beyond 3 wk. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, and ventilator settings prior to tracheostomy were reviewed. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included time on mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, and discharge disposition. RESULTS: Fifteen COVID-19 patients underwent tracheostomy at an average of 31 d post intubation. Two patients (13%) died. Half of our cohort was liberated from the ventilator (8 patients, 53%), with an average time to liberation of 14  6 d after tracheostomy. Among patients off mechanical ventilation, 5 (63%) had their tracheostomies removed prior to discharge. The average intensive care length of stay was 47  13 d (range 29-74 d) and the average hospital stay was 59  16 d (range 34-103 d). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports promising outcomes in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure and need for prolonged ventilation who undergo tracheostomy during their hospitalization. Further research is warranted to establish appropriate indications for tracheostomy in COVID-19 and confirm outcomes.","output":"Tracheostomy is Safe in Patients with Prolonged Intubation After Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 CG (covidcg.org) is an open resource for tracking SARS-CoV-2 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), lineages, and clades using the virus genomes on the GISAID database while filtering by location, date, gene, and mutation of interest.

Each step of FC measurement can influence the results, leading to misinterpretations and potentially impacting the management of IBD patients. To date, there is high heterogeneity between FC measurements and no current method is universally accepted as a standard. AIMS Our aim was to provide clear position statementsabout the pre-analytical and the analytical phases of FC measurement to homogenize FC levels and to minimize variability and risk of misinterpretation through aninternational consensus. MATERIALS & METHODS Fourteen physicians with expertise in the field of IBD and FC from 11 countries attended a virtual international consensus meeting on July 17th, 2020. A systematic literature was conducted and the literature evidence was shared and discussedamong the participants. Statements were formulated, discussed, and voted. Statements were considered approved if all participants agreed. RESULTS Nine statements were formulated and approved. Based on the available evidence, quantitative tests should be preferred for measuring FC. Furthermore, FC measurement, if possible, should always be performed with the same method and factors influencing FC levels should be taken into account when interpreting the results. DISCUSSION FC has an increasingly important role in the management of patients with IBD. However, large multicenter studies should be conducted to define the reproducibility and to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of the available FC tests. CONCLUSION FC concentrations guide clinicians' treatment decisions. Our statements have a relevant impact in daily practice and could be applied in clinical trials to standardize FC measurement.","output":"International consensus on methodological issues in standardization of fecal calprotectin measurement in inflammatory bowel diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus (CoV) belonging to the -CoV genus and it causes high mortality in infected sucking piglets, resulting in substantial losses in the farming industry. CoV trigger a drastic reorganization of host cell membranes to promote their replication and egression, but a detailed description of the intracellular remodeling induced by PEDV is still missing. In this study, we examined qualitatively and quantitatively, using electron microscopy, the intracellular membrane reorganization induced by PEDV over the course of an infection. With our ultrastructural approach, we reveal that, as most of CoV, PEDV initially forms double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which probably serve as replication/transcription platforms. Interestingly, we also found that viral particles start to form almost simultaneously in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs), which are compartments originating from the Golgi, confirming that -CoV assemble indistinguishably in two different organelles of the secretory pathway. Moreover, PEDV virons appear to have an immature and a mature form, similar to another -CoV the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Altogether, our study underlies the similarities and differences between the lifecycle of -CoV and that of viruses belonging to other CoV subfamilies.","output":"Ultrastructural Characterization of Membrane Rearrangements Induced by Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Since the beginning of the pandemic, COVID-19 affected specifically elderly people aged 70 years and over in whom the mortality rate is high.

Academic health centers rapidly deployed and leveraged telemedicine to permit uninterrupted care of patients. Telemedicine enjoys high patient satisfaction, yet little is known about the level of satisfaction during a crisis and to what extent patient- or visit-related factors and trust play when in-person visits are eliminated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine correlates of patients satisfaction with a telemedicine visit. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study conducted in our single-institution, urban, academic medical center in Los Angeles, internal medicine patients aged 18 years who completed a telemedicine visit between March 10th and April 17th, 2020, were invited for a survey (n=1624). Measures included patient demographics, degree of interpersonal trust in patient-physician relationships (using the Trust in Physician Scale), and visit-related concerns. Statistical analysis used descriptive statistics, Spearman rank-order correlation, and linear and ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1624 telemedicine visits conducted during this period, 368 (22.7%) patients participated in the survey. Across the study, respondents were very satisfied (173/365, 47.4%) or satisfied (n=129, 35.3%) with their telemedicine visit. Higher physician trust was associated with higher patient satisfaction (Spearman correlation r=0.51, P<.001). Visit-related factors with statistically significant correlation with Trust in Physician score were technical issues with the telemedicine visit (r=C0.16), concerns about privacy (r=C0.19), concerns about cost (r=C0.23), satisfaction with telemedicine convenience (r=0.41), and amount of time spent (r=0.47; all P<.01). Visit-related factors associated with patients satisfaction included fewer technical issues (P<.001), less concern about privacy (P<.001) or cost (P=.02), and successful face-to-face video (P<.001). The only patient variable with a significant positive association was income and level of trust in physician (r=0.18, P<.001). Younger age was associated with higher satisfaction with the telemedicine visit (P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: There have been calls for redesigning primary care after the COVID-19 pandemic and for the widespread adoption of telemedicine. Patients satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Their satisfaction is shaped by the degree of trust in physician and visit-related factors more so than patient factors. This has widespread implications for outpatient practices and further research into visit-related factors and the patient-provider connection over telemedicine is needed.","output":"Patient Satisfaction and Trust in Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has had profound effects on global health, healthcare, and public health policy. It has also impacted education. Within undergraduate healthcare education of doctors, nurses, and allied professions, rapid shifts to distance learning and pedagogic content creation within new realities, demands of healthcare practice settings, shortened curricula, and/or earlier graduation have also challenged ethics teaching in terms of curriculum allotments or content specification. We propose expanding the notion of resilience to the field of ethics education under the conditions of remote learning. Educational resilience starts in the virtual classroom of ethics teaching, initially constituted as an \\"unpurposed space\\" of exchange about the pandemic's challenging impact on students and educators. This continuously transforms into \\"purposed space\\" of reflection, discovering ethics as a repertory of orientative knowledge for addressing the pandemic's challenges on personal, professional, societal, and global levels and for discovering (and then addressing) that the health of individuals and populations also has moral determinants. As such, an educational resilience framework with inherent adaptability rises to the challenge of supporting the moral agency of students acting both as professionals and as global citizens. Educational resilience is key in supporting and sustaining professional identify formation and facilitating the development of students' moral resilience and leadership amid moral complexity and potential moral transgression-not only but especially in times of pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 era healthcare ethics education: Cultivating educational and moral resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper reviews the emerging big data literature applied to urban transportation issues from the perspective of economic research.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how VOA and remote expert instruction compare in learners skill acquisition, affective, and cognitive outcomes during surgical simulation training. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This instructor-blinded randomized clinical trial included medical students (undergraduate years 0-2) from 4 institutions in Canada during a single simulation training at McGill Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre, Montreal, Canada. Cross-sectional data were collected from January to April 2021. Analysis was conducted based on intention-to-treat. Data were analyzed from April to June 2021. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions included 5 feedback sessions, 5 minutes each, during a single 75-minute training, including 5 practice sessions followed by 1 realistic virtual reality brain tumor resection. The 3 intervention arms included 2 treatment groups, AI audiovisual metric-based feedback (VOA group) and synchronous verbal scripted debriefing and instruction from a remote expert (instructor group), and a control group that received no feedback. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The coprimary outcomes were change in procedural performance, quantified as Expertise Score by a validated assessment algorithm (Intelligent Continuous Expertise Monitoring System [ICEMS]; range, ?1.00 to 1.00) for each practice resection, and learning and retention, measured from performance in realistic resections by ICEMS and blinded Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS; range 1-7). Secondary outcomes included strength of emotions before, during, and after the intervention and cognitive load after intervention, measured in self-reports. RESULTS: A total of 70 medical students (41 [59%] women and 29 [41%] men; mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.3] years) from 4 institutions were randomized, including 23 students in the VOA group, 24 students in the instructor group, and 23 students in the control group. All participants were included in the final analysis. ICEMS assessed 350 practice resections, and ICEMS and OSATS evaluated 70 realistic resections. VOA significantly improved practice Expertise Scores by 0.66 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.77) points compared with the instructor group and by 0.65 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.77) points compared with the control group (P < .001). Realistic Expertise Scores were significantly higher for the VOA group compared with instructor (mean difference, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.67] points; P < .001) and control (mean difference. 0.49 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61] points; P < .001) groups. Mean global OSATS ratings were not statistically significant among the VOA (4.63 [95% CI, 4.06 to 5.20] points), instructor (4.40 [95% CI, 3.88-4.91] points), and control (3.86 [95% CI, 3.44 to 4.27] points) groups. However, on the OSATS subscores, VOA significantly enhanced the mean OSATS overall subscore compared with the control group (mean difference, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.13 to 1.96] points; P = .02), whereas expert instruction significantly improved OSATS subscores for instrument handling vs control (mean difference, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.22 to 2.14]; P = .01). No significant differences in cognitive load, positive activating, and negative emotions were found. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, VOA feedback demonstrated superior performance outcome and skill transfer, with equivalent OSATS ratings and cognitive and emotional responses compared with remote expert instruction, indicating advantages for its use in simulation training.

We hypothesized, following prohibition: there would be a significant change in the relative search volumes (RSV) of alcohol-related queries; that temporal analysis of the trends would reflect a public response to policy changes; and that geospatial analysis of RSV would correlate with the prevalence of alcohol use. METHODS: Three different search periods were used to test the hypotheses. The search inputs were based on potential public response to alcohol prohibition, as evidenced by the literature, newspaper articles, and consensus. We used RSV as the unit of analysis. Mean RSV of search queries, pre-post implementation of prohibition, were compared. Smoothing of scatter plots examined the temporal association of trends with policy measures. Multiple linear regression tested the relationship of state-wise RSV and alcohol use prevalence. RESULTS: Post-implementation of prohibition, a significant increase in the RSV was observed for searches related to alcohol withdrawal (p<0.001), how to extract alcohol from sanitizer (p = 0.002), alcohol home delivery online (p<0.001), alcohol home delivery (p<0.001), and sleeping pills (p = 0.006). The trends suggested a decrease in general interest in alcohol but increased demand, and a possible connection with changes in policy measures. State-level RSV and alcohol use prevalence did not reveal a significant relationship.

It also has an association with cancer, particularly prostate cancer. However, its association with lung cancer remains insufficiently explored. Thus, an in-depth investigation into the association between TMPRSS2 and lung cancer is significant, considering that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and that the lungs are the primary organ SARS-CoV-2 attacks. Methods Using five lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) genomics datasets, we explored associations between TMPRSS2 expression and immune signatures, cancer-associated pathways, tumor progression phenotypes, and clinical prognosis in LUAD by the bioinformatics approach. Furthermore, we validated the findings from the bioinformatics analysis by performing in vitro experiments with the human LUAD cell line A549 and in vivo experiments with mouse tumor models. We also validated our findings in LUAD patients from Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, China. Results TMPRSS2 expression levels were negatively correlated with the enrichment levels of CD8+ T and NK cells and immune cytolytic activity in LUAD, which represent antitumor immune signatures. Meanwhile, TMPRSS2 expression levels were negatively correlated with the enrichment levels of CD4+ regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and PD-L1 expression levels in LUAD, which represent antitumor immunosuppressive signatures. However, TMPRSS2 expression levels showed a significant positive correlation with the ratios of immune-stimulatory/immune-inhibitory signatures (CD8+ T cells/PD-L1) in LUAD. It indicated that TMPRSS2 levels had a stronger negative correlation with immune-inhibitory signatures than with immune-stimulatory signatures. TMPRSS2 downregulation correlated with elevated activities of many oncogenic pathways in LUAD, including cell cycle, mismatch repair, p53, and extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling. TMPRSS2 downregulation correlated with increased proliferation, stemness, genomic instability, tumor advancement, and worse survival in LUAD. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated the association of TMPRSS2 deficiency with increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion and antitumor immunity in LUAD. Moreover, in vivo experiments demonstrated that TMPRSS2-knockdown tumors were more sensitive to BMS-1, an inhibitor of PD-1/PD-L1. Conclusions TMPRSS2 is a tumor suppressor, while its downregulation is a positive biomarker of immunotherapy in LUAD.

It is noted that the speed and depth of this transformation is unprecedented for peacetime over the past 200 years. One of the most important indicators of turbulence is a certain deglobalization of the world economy. A study of the technological, social, economic, and political variables of social change has revealed that the traditional (for developed countries) social contract between government, business, and civil society has come to a crisis. This social contract has been in effect for more than half a century, since the times before globalization, the times of an industrial and bipolar world. Its inconsistency with modern realities, coupled with the inability of the old political center to offer convincing approaches to its modernization, has polarized societies and weakened social cohesion in the developed part of the world. As a result, populist and isolationist political forces have come to power. It is these forces that have started the dismantling of the existing system of global governance and its norms and institutions. The main contradiction of the current transformation in the world order is an attempt to bring back the polycentric world to a unipolar architecture with the dominance of the United States. The most likely scenario for resolving this contradiction is to create a new bipolarity. The author of the report expresses his views on the possible outlines of Russias foreign policy, which would enable the country to adapt to the bipolarity of the 21st century and to a new role as a balance-keeper.

Neuroimaging techniques aim to assist the physician in the diagnosis of brain disorders by using images. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a kind of neuroimaging technique employed to create 3D images of the brain. Due to many PET images, researchers attempted to develop computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to differentiate normal control from AD. Most of the earlier methods used image processing techniques for preprocessing and attributes extraction and then developed a model or classifier to classify the brain images. As a result, the retrieved features had a significant impact on the recognition rate of previous techniques. A novel and enhanced CAD system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is formulated to address this issue, capable of discriminating normal control from Alzheimer's disease patients. The proposed approach is evaluated using the 18FDG-PET images of 855 patients, including 635 normal control and 220 Alzheimer's disease patients from the ADNI database.

Although most viral infections can receive appropriate treatment thereby limiting damage to life and livelihood with modern medicine and early diagnosis, new types of viral infections are continuously emerging that need to be properly and timely treated. As time is the most important factor in the progress of many deadly viral diseases, early detection becomes of paramount importance for effective treatment. Aptamers are small oligonucleotide molecules made by the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Aptamers are characterized by being able to specifically bind to a target, much like antibodies. However, unlike antibodies, aptamers are easily synthesized, modified, and are able to target a wider range of substances, including proteins and carbohydrates. With these advantages in mind, many studies on aptamer-based viral diagnosis and treatments are currently in progress. The use of aptamers for viral diagnosis requires a system that recognizes the binding of viral molecules to aptamers in samples of blood, serum, plasma, or in virus-infected cells. From a therapeutic perspective, aptamers target viral particles or host cell receptors to prevent the interaction between the virus and host cells or target intracellular viral proteins to interrupt the life cycle of the virus within infected cells. In this paper, we review recent attempts to use aptamers for the diagnosis and treatment of various viral infections.","output":"Aptamers for Anti-Viral Therapeutics and Diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are vectors responsible for the transmission of several viruses of veterinary importance.

Methods:A prospective study was undertaken in a tertiary care centre from June 1st to September 31st, 2020(a period of 4months). A total of 706 medical staff were tested based on clinical symptoms and history of contact with confirmed or suspected covid -19 cases. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and placed in the VTM vials and transported to the laboratory. RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase CPolymerase chain reaction) was performed for diagnosis of Covid-19. Results:A total of 153 of 706 HCWs were tested positive for COVID-19, with an infection rate of 21.6%.Of them,113 (74%) were symptomatic while 40 were asymptomatic (26%).The median age of the HCWs was 34 yrs, 86 (56.2%) were males,67 were females. Among 153 HCW, 102(67%) were clinical staff who were directly in contact with patients. The prevalence of subclinical infection was 5.2% (8 of 153) among asymptomatic HCWs. The most common symptoms were cough (67, 59.2%), fever (51, 45%), and sore throat (48, 42.4%). Type 2 Diabetes mellitus was the most common comor- bidity (30, 19.6%).Out of 153, 63 HCWs (41.1%) had history of contact with confirmed or suspected covid 19 cases.

This way, vaccine nationalism and vaccine diplomacy constitute new forms of and fronts for colonialism.

While investigating a human psittacosis outbreak that was associated with avian chlamydiosis in Hong Kong, we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots, which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals. The novel adenovirus (tentatively named Psittacine adenovirus HKU1) was most closely related to Duck adenovirus A in the Atadenovirus genus. Sequencing showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome consists of 31,735 nucleotides. Comparative genome analysis showed that the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 genome contains 23 open reading frames (ORFs) with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes, and six additional ORFs at the 3 end of the genome. Similar to Duck adenovirus A, the novel adenovirus lacks LH1, LH2 and LH3, which distinguishes it from other viruses in the Atadenovirus genus. Notably, fiber-2 protein, which is present in Aviadenovirus but not Atadenovirus, is also present in Psittacine adenovirus HKU1. Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 had pairwise amino acid sequence identities of 50.3C54.0% for the DNA polymerase, 64.6C70.7% for the penton protein, and 66.1C74.0% for the hexon protein with other Atadenovirus. The C. psittaci bacterial load was positively correlated with adenovirus viral load in the lung. Immunostaining for fiber protein expression was positive in lung and liver tissue cells of affected parrots, confirming active viral replication. No other viruses were found. This is the first documentation of an adenovirus-C. psittaci co-infection in an avian species that was associated with a human outbreak of psittacosis. Viral-bacterial co-infection often increases disease severity in both humans and animals. The role of viral-bacterial co-infection in animal-to-human transmission of infectious agents has not received sufficient attention and should be emphasized in the investigation of disease outbreaks in human and animals.","output":"A Novel Psittacine Adenovirus Identified During an Outbreak of Avian Chlamydiosis and Human Psittacosis: Zoonosis Associated with Virus-Bacterium Coinfection in Birds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The measurement of diffuse 21-cm radiation from the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (HI signal) in different redshifts is an important tool for modern cosmology.

We also aimed to investigate whether muscle strength and flexibility would change when the players returned to play after COVID-19 confinement. METHODS: Thirty professional male soccer (Age; 24.9  4.8 yrs, BMI; 22.7  1.4 kg/m2) players participated in this study. Hamstring eccentric strength, hip abduction-adduction strength and posterior chain flexibility (PCF) were measured before (time 1) and after the home confinement period (time 2) and after return to play (time 3). Repeated measures of ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: PCF decreased from time 1 to time 2 (p = 0.005) but it increased from time 2 to time 3 (p = 0.03). Hamstring eccentric strength decreased from time 1 to time 2 for both dominant (p = 0.002) and non-dominant (p = 0.04) limbs and no difference was observed between time 2 and time 3 (p > 0.05). Hip abductor and adductor strength did not change between time 1 and time 2 (p > 0.05) but they increased from time 2 and time 3 in the dominant limb (p < 0.05). Five players (16%) had muscle injuries including hamstrings and adductors when they returned to play. CONCLUSION: This study showed that 8-week COVID-19 confinement had an adverse effect on hamstring eccentric strength and PCF and 3 players had hamstring muscle injuries when they returned to play.

Design/methodology/approach: This study estimates the effects of statewide stay-at-home orders on new COVID-19 cases and deaths within 19 central states, of which 14 had stay-at-home orders. It uses synthetic control analysis and nearest neighbor matching to estimate the effects at two geographic levels: counties and health service areas. Findings: Statewide stay-at-home orders significantly reduced the number of new COVID-19 cases in the Central USA starting about three weeks after their effective dates;during the fourth week after their effective dates, the orders reduced the number of new cases per capita by 31%C57%. Statewide stay-at-home orders did not reduce the number of new COVID-19 deaths in the Central USA. Social implications: The main purpose of stay-at-home orders in Spring 2020 was to flatten the curve so that hospitalizations would not exceed capacity. It is likely that stay-at-home orders in the Central USA reduced hospitalizations to some extent, although the effect on hospitalizations was likely smaller than the effect on cases.

The pandemic nature of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak increases the likelihood of infection from humans of susceptible animal species that, thus, could become secondary viral hosts and even disease reservoirs. We present evidence of spillover infection of wild mustelids by reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in a Eurasian river otter found near a water reservoir in the Valencian Community (Spain). We detected the virus using two different commercial RTqPCR assays on RNA extracted from the nasopharynx (swabbing) and from lung tissue and mediastinal lymph node homogenates. The corresponding samples from two additional otters from distant sites tested negative in identical assays. The diagnosis in the positive otter was confirmed by two-tube RT-PCR assay in which RNA was first retrotranscribed, and then specific regions of the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), and ORF10 genes were separately amplified from the produced cDNA, followed by electrophoretic visualization and Sanger sequencing.

Universities are central in improving science education, as a relatively small group of 33 higher education providers can directly influence generations of primary teachers responsible for foundational science learning. Since this is a major review of primary science practice at Australian universities, factors including, but not limited to, changing employment conditions, shifts in study modes and an ever-expanding research literature base need to be considered in a more contemporary review. This paper aims to describe the reported primary science practices, challenges and strengths of Australian teacher education programs through semi-structured interviews and online surveys with 17 academics and analyses of public materials on university websites. Thematic analyses reveal noteworthy diversity in approaches, united by authenticity and student-centred learning. Key strengths included robustness of educational approaches, relevance and teaching team compositions. Key challenges included time, external pressures, resources and student capacity. These nuanced findings will be discussed as they relate to teaching and research.","output":"Primary Science Education in Australian Universities: An Overview of Context and Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic has rocked the lives of human beings every-where in ways never imagined, forcing us to question where our civilization is headed. In this article, we explore and discuss scien-tifi c evidence that helps explain recent events in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 is caused by infection with a zoonotic-origin novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, that is genetically close to two coronavirus types iso-lated in bats. The transmission dynamics to humans from the original and intermediary hosts remain poorly understood, but it is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infected humans after undergoing an inter-species transfer from bats to an intermediate species, and from there to human beings. Crossing the species barrier is largely fostered by industrial-scale agricultural practices that simplify original ecosystem connections by reducing biodiversity, facilitating the emergence of new infectious diseases. The scientifi c community has played an exemplary role in responding to this global emergency, working to fi nd timely, relevant solutions for governments and society as a whole. We need to take this opportunity to promote a global and open science that delves into the interrelation-ships of the biological, environmental, social and economic dimen-sions of this and other diseases while questioning current modes of production and their impact on the environment, and thus on human health worldwide.

During one of the focus group conversations, Abdul (not his real name) explained how his Somali-Christian identity presented a dilemma whilst he lived with fellow Muslim Somali nationals when he was displaced during the 2015 xenophobic violence in Johannesburg. Firstly, this contribution discusses a general overview of the situation of migration and then his situation is explored from the themes, which emerged from this study from the lens of bicultural and acculturation processes of identity formation. Although this was not a representative sample of male foreign migrant experiences, analysing Abduls situation within a post-colonial and bicultural acculturation paradigm revealed the embedded trajectories at the interface between religion, identity and migration in social and economic processes of transformation. Sketching Abduls experiences through these lenses also generated contested processes on the interface of religion and identity that reflect the significance of the role played by religion in identity constructions which are open to change (and sometimes present a dilemma), as life circumstances fluctuate with complex interactions in search of survival strategies to ward off any potential threats to a flourishing life. Such survival strategies highlight how these encounters generate hybrid identities and discourses with new boundaries, which, although fluid, volatile and situational, are reminiscent with historical and odious notions of colonialism that present African migrants as undesired foreigners whilst portraying other western and Asian migrants in cosy terms such as expatriates and tourists. Contribution: Exploring the relevance of migrant expressions within the context of identity constructions and socio-economic framework demonstrates how contested processes of socio-economic and religious transformation reflect the significance of the role played by religion on identity constructions. These constructions are articulated through fluid and complex encounters, which fluctuate to generate hybrid identities and migrant survival discourses.","output":"Im Somali and Im Christian: A dilemma for religion and identity in the context of migration in Southern Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid, sensitive and specific detection and reporting of infectious pathogens is important for patient management and epidemic surveillance.

PARTICIPANTS: Patients from a population-based cohort study including all laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 admitted to hospital during a 3-month period in a health care region in Sweden. Among patients who, based on a standardized telephone interview, were identified as having persisting rehabilitation needs 4 months after discharge (n=185), several (n=57) reported vision-related symptoms. All 57 patients were invited to a neuro-visual examination. Six patients declined, six were unavailable and three did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Thus 42 patients were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vision-related symptoms, neuro-visual function, and co-existing impairments affecting activities of daily life and participation. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients with rehabilitation needs after Covid-19 reported vision-related symptoms. Reading-related issues (73.8%), blurry vision (69.0%), and light sensitivity (66.7%) were the most common symptoms. Patients with reading-related issues showed a higher level of eye strain (p<0.001).

The Papain-like protease (PLpro) is a domain of Nsp3 - a large multidomain protein that is an essential component of the replication-transcription complex, making it a good therapeutic target. PLpro is a multi-functional protein encoded in coronaviruses that can cleave viral polyproteins, poly-ubiquitin and protective Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 product, ISG15, which mimics a head-to-tail linked ubiquitin (Ub) dimer. PLpro across coronavirus families showed divergent selectivity for recognition and cleavage of these protein substrates despite sequence conservation. However, it is not clear how sequence changes in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro alter its selectivity for substrates and what outcome this has on the pathogenesis of the virus. We show that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro preferentially binds ISG15 over Ub and K48-linked Ub2. We determined crystal structures of PLpro in complex with human K48-Ub2 and ISG15 revealing that dual domain recognition of ISG15 drives substrate selectivity over Ub and Ub2. We also characterized the PLpro substrate interactions using solution NMR, cross-linking mass spectrometry to support that ISG15 is recognized via two domains while Ub2 binds primarily through one Ub domain. Finally, energetic analysis of the binding interfaces between PLpro from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with ISG15 and Ub2 define the sequence determinants for how PLpros from different coronaviruses recognize two topologically distinct substrates and how evolution of the protease altered its substrate selectivity.

In this paper, authors from several of the key countries involved in COVID-19 propose a holistic systems model that views the problem from a perspective of human society including the natural environment, human population, health system, and economic system. We model the crisis theoretically as a feedback control problem with delay, and partial controllability and observability. Using a quantitative model of the human population allows us to test different assumptions such as detection threshold, delay to take action, fraction of the population infected, effectiveness and length of confinement strategies, and impact of earlier lifting of social distancing restrictions. Each conceptual scenario is subject to 1000+ Monte-Carlo simulations and yields both expected and surprising results. For example, we demonstrate through computational experiments that maintaining strict confinement policies for longer than 60 days may indeed be able to suppress lethality below 1% and yield the best health outcomes, but cause economic damages due to lost work that could turn out to be counterproductive in the long term.

Several studies have highlighted the psychological impacts of the outbreak in Hong Kong but have largely ignored the protective factors that contribute to resilience among vulnerable families. This study adopted an ecological resilience framework to explore the impact of this epidemic on members of families with youth with a delinquent tendency/mental health concerns and the ecological protective factors for these vulnerable families. METHODS: Random sampling based on a sampling frame provided by one of the largest local social service organizations in Hong Kong led to the recruitment of 407 respondents who were interviewed using a battery of standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: The results showed that 30.6% and 11.5% of respondents reported a moderate and a severe level of psychological distress, respectively, almost double the percentages reported in a previous study conducted in Hong Kong before the COVID-19 outbreak. Around 36.6% of respondents indicated they had encountered financial problems and almost 40% indicated aggravated financial circumstances since the outbreak. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that financial stress was the strongest predictor of psychological distress. Structural equation modeling indicated that family support, indoor leisure activities and community resources significantly mediated the negative influence of COVID-19-related stressors on psychological distress of family members. CONCLUSION: Family leisure activities, family support, community spirit and mutual help within the context of social-distancing restrictions may need to be promoted to benefit vulnerable families in Hong Kong under the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Risk and resilience of vulnerable families in Hong Kong under the impact of COVID-19: an ecological resilience perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nutraceutical treatments can reduce inflammation and prevent the development of inflammatory diseases In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of Smilax guianensis Vitman extract (SGE) were examined SGE suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated nitrite production in RAW 264 7 cells SGE also prevented the LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) but not cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 Western blot analysis showed that SGE attenuated LPS-induced phosphorylation of IB kinase, inhibitor of kappa B (IB), and p65 Additionally, SGE inhibited LPS-induced IB degradation in RAW 264 7 cells Western blot analysis of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, as well as immunofluorescence assay results, revealed that SGE suppressed LPS-induced p65 nuclear translocation in RAW 264 7 cells Moreover, SGE reduced LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) mRNA expression and IL-1 and IL-6 protein expression in RAW 264 7 cells Collectively, these results indicate that SGE suppresses the NF-B signaling pathway and thereby inhibits the production of NO, IL-1, and IL-6","output":"Smilax guianensis Vitman extract prevents LPS-induced inflammation by inhibiting the NF-B pathway in RAW 264.7 cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an emergent infectious disease that has caused millions of deaths throughout the world.

In a concurrent inpatient cohort of 7,933 hospitalized with COVID-19, we tested their association with in-hospital mortality. The robustness of the observations was assessed in a contemporary cohort (May - August). In the outpatient study, neither ACE inhibitors (HR, 0.77, 0.53-1.13, P=0.18), nor ARBs (HR, 0.88, 0.61-1.26, P=0.48), were associated with hospitalization risk. ACE inhibitors were associated with lower hospitalization risk in the older Medicare group (HR, 0.61, 0.41-0.93, P=0.02), but not the younger commercially insured group (HR, 2.14, 0.82-5.60, P=0.12; P-interaction 0.09). Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs were associated with lower hospitalization risk in either population in the validation cohort.

DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Embase from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to October 20, 2020, for studies that discussed the chest CT findings in infants younger than 1 year with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies comprising 70 COVID-19 (58.5% boys) confirmed infants were included. The mean age of the included patients was 4.1 months with a range of 1 day to 12 months. Chest CT scans showed bilateral abnormalities in 34 patients, and unilateral lung involvement in 25 patients. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (71.43%) were found to be the most prevalent chest CT manifestation, followed by peribronchial thickening (60%), linear or band-shaped opacities (32.8%), consolidation (28.57%), nodule (18.57%), effusion (7.14%) and focal lucency (7.14%). CONCLUSIONS: GGO and peribronchial thickening were the most prevalent findings in the infants' chest CT scans. Linear or band-shaped opacities, consolidation, and pulmonary nodules are more common in infants than in adults. These findings suggest that the disease is more likely to be presented as an atypical pneumonia (peribronchial thickening and linear or band-shaped opacities) in this age group.

Clinical symptoms of the disease range from paucisymptomatic disease to a much more severe disease. Typical symptoms of the initial phase include fever and cough, with possible progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain are reported in a considerable number of affected individuals and may be due to the SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the peptidase angiotensin receptor 2. The intestinal homeostasis and microenvironment appear to play a major role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and in the enhancement of the systemic inflammatory responses. Long-term consequences of COVID-19 include respiratory disturbances and other disabling manifestations, such as fatigue and psychological impairment. To date, there is a paucity of data on the gastrointestinal sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since COVID-19 can directly or indirectly affect the gut physiology in different ways, it is plausible that functional bowel diseases may occur after the recovery because of potential pathophysiological alterations (dysbiosis, disruption of the intestinal barrier, mucosal microinflammation, post-infectious states, immune dysregulation and psychological stress).

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with SLE, healthcare providers and other representative stakeholders. Focus groups were conducted, and based on the collected data the most impactful disruption points in SLE patient pathways were identified. A novel framework to improve individual patient pathways in SLE was developed, discussed and validated during a consensus meeting with representative stakeholders. RESULTS: Six thematic clusters regarding disruption in optimal patient pathways in SLE were identified: appropriate and timely referral strategy for SLE diagnosis; the need for a dedicated consultation during which the diagnosis of SLE would be announced, and following which clarifications and psychological support offered; individualised patient pathways with coordinated care based on organ involvement, disease severity and patient preference; improved therapeutic patient education; prevention of complications such as infections, osteoporosis and cancer; and additional patient support. During the consensus meeting, the broader panel of stakeholders achieved consensus on these attributes and a framework for optimising SLE patient pathways was developed.

Detecting viral RNAs on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs is the standard approach for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with variable success. Currently, there are only a few studies describing the serological diagnostic methods that involve the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG. Here, we aimed to develop a more quantitative and sensitive serological test for COVID-19 diagnosis, monitoring and clinical investigation, based on the detection of antigen-specific IgA as well as IgM and IgG in blood in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In this investigation, we report the development of a set of validated diagnostic kits for detecting serum IgA, IgM, and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein by chemi-luminescence immuno-analysis. The kits were tested with a cohort of 216 sera from 87 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, and 483 sera from SARS-CoV-2 negative or healthy individuals as negative controls. A standard receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. Using the kits, serum levels of IgA, IgM, and IgG were analyzed, in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Findings The diagnostic kits based on the RBD antigen outperformed those based on the NP. RBD-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG detection kits showed sensitivities of 98.6%, 96.8%, and 96.8%, and specificities of 98.1%, 92.3%, and 99.8%, respectively. In addition, using purified RBD-specific immunoglobulins from a serum pool of COVID-19 patients as standards, the serum concentrations of RBD-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG proteins were determined. The concentrations varied widely among different patients. Median concentration of IgA and IgM reached peaks at 16-20 days after illness onset at 8.84 g/mL and 7.25 g/mL, respectively, while median concentration of IgG peaked during 21-25 days after illness onset at 16.47 g/mL. Furthermore, the serum IgA level positively correlates with COVID-19 severity. Interpretation Our immunoassay of measuring SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies IgA, IgM, and IgG in serum provides a better serological testing with improved sensitivity and specificity. Data of IgA, IgM, and IgG responses in blood of COVID-19 patients may provide novel insight for the monitoring and treatments of COVID-19.

Infection of human cell lines with intact xenogenic adenoviruses established the principle that these viruses are replication defective at the inputs tested, although the molecular basis for defective replication is not understood. Most work with xenogenic vectors is still firmly based in the laboratory and while this is appropriate to demonstrate the utility of a vector the amount of work required for eventual exploitation of a vector in the clinic should not be underestimated.

AREAS COVERED: The authors review the scientific literature on the drug design landscape of -ketoamide SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The X-ray/neutron crystal structure of three such compounds is available, which has allowed for drug design rationalization. The -ketoamide functionality of the inhibitors reacts with the catalytic dyad cysteine residue to form a hemithioketal. The S3, S2, and S1' subsites of the protease are filled with various aromatic or aliphatic (cyclic/acyclic) moieties of the peptidomimetic, whereas in S1, the preferred moiety was a rigid 2-pyrrolidone or norvaline side chain (as in telaprevir). EXPERT OPINION: Crystallography, previous drug design efforts, and many computational studies have allowed for a deeper understanding of the structural requirements needed for designing effective SARS-CoV-2 Mpro -ketoamide inhibitors. However, all the reported derivatives are peptidomimetics with a rather high molecular weight. It is expected that effective compounds with lower molecular weights and a lesser peptidomimetic profile will be the target for future drug development.","output":"Perspectives on the design and discovery of -ketoamide inhibitors for the treatment of novel coronavirus: where do we stand and where do we go?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 outbreak remains an ongoing issue, there are concerns about its disruption, the level of its disruption, how long this pandemic is going to last, and how innovative technological solutions like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and expert systems can assist to deal with this pandemic.

DESIGN: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study in which clinical and laboratory data from 237 women of child-bearing age diagnosed with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Menstrual data from 177 patients were analysed. Blood samples from the early follicular phase were tested for sex hormones and anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH). RESULTS: Among 237 patients with confirmed COVID-19, severely ill patients had more comorbidities than mildly ill patients (34% versus 8%), particularly for patients with diabetes, hepatic disease and malignant tumours. Of 177 patients with menstrual records, 45 (25%) patients presented with menstrual volume changes, and 50 (28%) patients had menstrual cycle changes, mainly a decreased volume (20%) and a prolonged cycle (19%). The average sex hormone and AMH concentrations of women of child-bearing age with COVID-19 were not different from those of age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Average sex hormone concentrations and ovarian reserve did not change significantly in COVID-19 women of child-bearing age. Nearly one-fifth of patients exhibited a menstrual volume decrease or cycle prolongation. The menstruation changes of these patients might be the consequence of transient sex hormone changes caused by suppression of ovarian function that quickly resume after recovery.","output":"Analysis of sex hormones and menstruation in COVID-19 women of child-bearing age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sigh is a cyclic brief recruitment manoeuvre: previous physiological studies showed that its use could be an interesting addition to pressure support ventilation to improve lung elastance, decrease regional heterogeneity and increase release of surfactant. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the clinical application of sigh during pressure support ventilation (PSV) feasible? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a multi-center non-inferiority randomized clinical trial on adult intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing PSV. Patients were randomized to the No Sigh group and treated by PSV alone, or to the Sigh group, treated by PSV plus sigh (increase of airway pressure to 30 cmH2Ofor 3 seconds once per minute) until day 28 or death or successful spontaneous breathing trial. The primary endpoint of the study was feasibility, assessed as non-inferiority (5% tolerance) in the proportion of patients failing assisted ventilation. Secondary outcomes included safety, physiological parameters in the first week from randomization, 28-day mortality and ventilator-free days. RESULTS: Two-hundred fifty-eight patients (31% women; median age 65 [54-75] years) were enrolled. In the Sigh group, 23% of patients failed to remain on assisted ventilation vs. 30% in the No Sigh group (absolute difference -7%, 95%CI -18% to 4%; p=0.015 for non-inferiority). Adverse events occurred in 12% vs. 13% in Sigh vs. No Sigh (p=0.852).

In this context of quarantine, all commercial and productive activities are suspended, and many Countries are experiencing a serious crisis. To this aim, the understanding of risk of contagion in every urban district is fundamental for governments and administrations to establish reopening strategies. This paper proposes the calibration of an index able to predict the risk of contagion in urban districts in order to support the administrations in identifying the best strategies to reduce or restart the local activities during lockdown conditions. The objective regards the achievement of a useful tool to predict the risk of contagion by considering socio-economic data such as the presence of activities, companies, institutions and number of infections in urban districts. The proposed index is based on a factorial formula, simple and easy to be applied by practitioners, calibrated by using an optimization-based procedure and exploiting data of 257 urban districts of Apulian region (Italy). Moreover, a comparison with a more refined analysis, based on the training of Artificial Neural Networks, is performed in order to take into account the non-linearity of the phenomenon.

Increasing attention has recently been paid to the role that the gut, and the microorganisms inhabiting it, play in emotion and cognition. Animal studies have revealed the importance of the vagus nerve in mediating communication between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, resulting in changes in emotional behaviour. This has renewed interest in understanding the role of vagal signalling in human emotion, particularly since human studies have also shown that alterations in gut microbiome composition can affect emotion. While stimulating the vagus nerve can help treat some cases of severe depression, here we investigate whether vagal afferent signalling can influence emotional processing in healthy subjects. We use the dot-probe task to determine the effect of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation on attentional biases towards emotional stimuli in 42 volunteers. Participants received both active and sham treatments using a within-subject design. We show that transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation reduces the emotional bias towards faces expressing sadness and happiness, indicating a decrease in emotional reactivity. While our novel findings reveal the effect that vagal signalling can have on emotional biases in healthy subjects, future studies should seek to develop our understanding of the ways in which the microbiome interacts with, and stimulates, the vagus nerve. Since we find a reduction in emotional bias, most notably towards sadness, this may partly account for the effective use of vagus nerve stimulation in treatment-resistant depression. While its clinical application currently involves surgical stimulation, our results support the potential benefit of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation as a non-invasive, intermittent adjunctive therapy for patients with depression given its frequent association with emotional biases.","output":"Gut Feelings: Vagal Stimulation Reduces Emotional Biases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become a novel therapeutic modality against cancer due to their specificity, affinity and serum stability. These incredible tools capable of linking variable payload, generate antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) that preserve targeting properties and therefore, specifically deliver drugs to the cancer cells.

The linkers play a pivotal role in ADC design as they link the cytotoxic payload to the antibody. Linkers maintain the stability of the ADCs in the blood circulation securing their delivery to the cancer cell intact but cleaved when internalized to release the payload. Recently, a more advanced version of ADC, namely theranostic (therapeutic and diagnostic) ADC has emerged. These conjugates allow visualization of targeted drug delivery (TDD) vastly impacting the therapeutic index in cancer treatment.

Patent protection is the primary legal mechanism for ensuring timely development of such a vaccine. The patent system is designed to create the necessary incentives for private parties to invest in developing the vaccine, knowing they will enjoy the fruits of their success. Indeed, patent protection is necessary to promote human knowledge generally as well as a quick, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccine.Yet in reality, patent law may be obstructing the very goal it is intended to achieve. Patent law grants exclusive rights to inventors, enabling them to charge supracompetitive prices, delaying the distribution and dissemination of emerging technologies. In the context of the COVID-19 vaccine, patent protection means that vaccines will be financially out of reach for many. This produces a paradoxical result: rather than promote technological advancement for the public good, patent protection impedes it. Since universal immunity is necessary in the fight against the pandemic, delays in vaccine distribution can be catastrophic, costing millions of lives and carrying devastating economic consequences.This Article therefore proposes a novel, alternative patent regime, designed to overcome this paradox at the heart of patent law. We propose a mechanism that will eliminate the problem of over-protection of patent rights that exists under current patent law, while still providing sufficient incentive for inventors to invest in innovative efforts. Under our proposed regime, the developer of a new vaccine will be granted a patent protecting its invention, but this patent will expire once the patentee has recouped its investment, plus a handsome profit. This regime, which we term recoupment patent, ensures that inventors are rewarded appropriatelybut not excessivelyfor their innovative efforts. The result is a structure that encourages innovation while minimizing the time it takes for life-saving inventions to reach the public domain. We compare the proposed regime with other suggestions for reforming the patent system, including compulsory licensing, government incentives such as grants, subsidies, and prizes, and altruistic initiatives such as private-public partnerships, patent pools, and patent pledges, and we highlight the recoupment patent models advantages over these alternatives.","output":"Recalibrating Patent Protection for COVID-19 Vaccines: A Path to Affordable Access and Equitable Distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-dimensional classification and feature selection tasks are ubiquitous with the recent advancement in data acquisition technology.

Scalable inference is achieved via developing a variational scheme that exploits advances in the use of sparse inverse covariance matrices. We demonstrate the performance of our methodology on simulated datasets and two proteomics datasets: breast cancer and SARS-CoV-2. Our approach distinguishes itself by offering explainability as well as uncertainty quantification in addition to low computational cost, which are crucial to increase trust and social acceptance of data-driven tools.","output":"Non-stationary Gaussian process discriminant analysis with variable selection for high-dimensional functional data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Pediatric acute appendicitis has a stable incidence rate in Western countries with an annual change of -0.36%. However, a sharp increase was observed in the Asian region. The Indonesian Health Department reveals appendicitis as the fourth most infectious disease, with more than 64,000 patients annually. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify and evaluate the risk factors and diagnostic modalities for accurate diagnosis and early treatment. This study also clarifies the usage of pediatric appendicitis score (PAS) for children <5 years of age. METHODS: The current study employed a cross-sectional design with purposive sampling through demographic and PAS questionnaires with ultrasound sonography (USG) results. The analysis was performed using the chi-square and MannCWhitney tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: This study included 21 qualified patients with an average age of 6.764.679 years, weighing 21.7210.437 kg, and who had been hospitalized for 4.241.513 days in Siloam Teaching Hospital. Compared to the surgical gold standard, PAS and USG have moderate sensitivity and specificity. Bodyweight and stay duration were significant for appendicitis (p<0.05); however, all were confounders in the multivariate regression analysis. Incidentally, a risk prediction model was generated with an area under the curve of 72.73%, sensitivity of 100.0%, specificity of 54.5%, and a cut-off value of 151. CONCLUSION: PAS outperforms USG in the sensitivity of diagnosing appendicitis, whereas USG outperforms PAS in terms of specificity. This study demonstrates the use of PAS in children under 5 years old. Meanwhile, no risk factors were significant in multivariate pediatric acute appendicitis risk factors.","output":"Pre-Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pediatric Acute Appendicitis: Risk Factors Model and Diagnosis Modality in a Developing Low-Income Country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Handwashing has been widely recommended to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Despite this, handwashing behavior remains low in the general public. Social marketing has been employed as a successful health promotion strategy for changing many health behaviors in the past. The present study examines if message framing influences the effectiveness of a handwashing health promotion messages at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a between-subjects cross-sectional experiment, participants (N = 344) in the United States were randomly assigned to view one of four handwashing messages or a control message before completing self-report measures of attitudes, emotions, readiness to change, and behavioral intentions around handwashing. Simple handwashing messages were presented with different framings, including a simple exchange message, a gain message, a social norm appeal, and a guilt appeal. Results revealed that message type influenced handwashing behavioral intentions and emotions. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that the simple exchange message produced significantly higher intentions than other messages and that only the simple exchange message significantly differed from the control message on emotions regarding handwashing. Mediational analyses showed handwashing emotions fully mediated the relationship between messaging and handwashing intentions. This mediation effect was moderated by age, such that it occurred for the younger and middle age participants, but not older participants. These results suggest that even simple, brief, and easily conveyable messages can positively impact behavioral intentions around handwashing during the early stages of a health crisis. Consistent with recent research comparing affective and cognitive pathways for health behavior, the mediational analysis suggests that effect of the simple exchange message on intentions was due to increased positive emotions around handwashing.","output":"Handwashing Message Type Predicts Behavioral Intentions in the United States at the Beginning of the Global COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: During COVID-19, due to the worldwide shortages of medical masks, homemade cloth masks became a mainstay of the pandemic. The CDC and WHO recommend the use of homemade cloth masks. However, there is insufficient evidence on the performance: respiratory droplet blocking ability, water-resistant capacity, breathability, and washability of commonly used fabrics to design high-performing cloth masks that can outperform medical masks. Material and Methods: We conducted a series of experiments on aerosol blocking (using healthy volunteers sneeze, image-based flow measurement technique), water-resistant, breathability, and washability to evaluate all dimensions of protection of 17 different commonly available fabrics and their layered combinations. Results: The research provides a blueprint for the optimal design of a high-performing cloth mask that can outperform a 3-layered surgical mask. A minimum of 3 layers is recommended to provide the performance of surgical masks. A combination of cotton/linen for the inner layer, blends for the middleClayer, and polyester/nylon for the outerClayer. The average thread count (threads contained in one square inch) should be greater than 200, and the porosity (percent of pores in a fabric) should be less than 2 %. Increasing the number of layers increases the droplet blocking efficiency by approximately 20 times per additional fabric layer. Machine washing at 60 C did not affect the performance of cloth masks. Conclusions: These results and visualizations can assist people in preparing effective homemade cloth masks during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics.","output":"A blueprint for well-designed, high-performing cloth masks that can outperform a 3-layered surgical mask"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have read with great interest the article by Polak et al. on the behalf of the European Liver and Intestine Transplant Association (ELITA) and the European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR) recently published in your Journal [1].

We report our challenges caring for CARDS patients on VV-ECMO and alterations to traditional management strategies. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of our institutional strategies for managing patients with COVID-19 who required VV-ECMO in a dedicated airlock biocontainment unit (BCU), from March to June 2020. The data collected included the time course of admission, VV-ECMO run, ventilator length, hospital length of stay, and major events related to bleeding, such as pneumothorax and tracheostomy. The dispensation of sedation agents and trial therapies were obtained from institutional pharmacy tracking. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. (3) Results: Forty COVID-19 patients on VV-ECMO were managed in the BCU during this period, from which 21 survived to discharge and 19 died. The criteria for ECMO initiation was altered for age, body mass index, and neurologic status/cardiac arrest. All cannulations were performed with a bedside ultrasound-guided percutaneous technique. Ventilator and ECMO management were routed in an ultra-lung protective approach, though varied based on clinical setting and provider experience. There was a high incidence of pneumothorax (n = 19). Thirty patients had bedside percutaneous tracheostomy, with more procedural-related bleeding complications than expected. A higher use of sedation was noted. The timing of decannulation was also altered, given the system constraints. A variety of trial therapies were utilized, and their effectiveness is yet to be determined. (4) Conclusions: Even in a high-volume ECMO center, there are challenges in caring for an expanded capacity of patients during a viral respiratory pandemic. Though institutional resources and expertise may vary, it is paramount to proceed with insightful planning, the recognition of challenges, and the dynamic application of lessons learned when facing a surge of critically ill patients.","output":"A Dedicated Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Unit during a Respiratory Pandemic: Lessons Learned from COVID-19 Part II: Clinical Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently wreaking havoc in human societies To understand how this virus causes disease, the molecular biology of the virus needs to be studied in more detail There is a large body of work on the molecular strategies of previous coronaviruses that infected humans, which can be directly applied to SARS-CoV-2 In the current review we highlight the novel aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus life cycle, and how this and other viruses interact with the biochemistry of the host organism We provide a discussion of different types of viruses as a background to understand coronaviruses Specifically, we compare the life cycles of coronaviruses with that of a model retrovirus, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) We describe the genomic, transcription and translation control features of coronaviruses with a focus on protein structures and activities that can be selected as molecular targets of therapy","output":"Molecular biology of sars-cov-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: About 5% of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients will need intensive care unit (ICU) admission for hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring oxygen support. The choice between early mechanical ventilation and noninvasive oxygen therapies, such as, high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and/or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has to balance the contradictory priorities of protecting healthcare workers by minimizing aerosol-generation and optimizing resource management. This survey over two timeframes aimed to explore the controversial issue of location and noninvasive oxygen therapy in non-intubated ICU patients using a clinical vignette. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was designed, piloted, and distributed electronically to Indian intensivists/anesthetists, from private hospitals, government hospitals, and medical college hospitals (the latter two referred to as first-responder hospitals), who are directly responsible for admitting/managing patients in ICU. RESULTS: Of the 204 responses (125/481 in phase 1 and 79/320 in phase 2), 183 responses were included. Respondents from first-responder hospitals were more willing to manage non-intubated hypoxemic patients in neutral pressure rooms, while respondents from private hospitals preferred negative-pressure rooms (p < 0.001). In both the phases, private hospital doctors were less comfortable to use any form of noninvasive oxygen therapies in neutral-pressure rooms compared to first-responder hospitals (low-flow oxygen therapy: 72 vs 50%, p < 0.01; HFNO: 47 vs 24%, p < 0.01 and NPPV: 38 vs 28%, p = 0.20). INTERPRETATION: Variations existed in practices among first-responder and private intensivists/anesthetists. The resource optimal private hospital intensivists/anesthetists were less comfortable using noninvasive oxygen therapies in managing COVID-19 patients.

This study aimed to explore the key pharmacological mechanisms of Tongfu decoction in treating postoperative ileus (POI). METHODS: The active ingredients of Tongfu decoction and their targets were screened using the TCMSP database and STITCH and SwissTargetPrediction databases, respectively. The GeneCards and DisGeNET databases were used to obtain POI dysfunction-related therapeutic targets. After screening, a drug-active-ingredient-therapeutic target network was constructed and the key target functional enrichment analysis was carried out. The SpragueCDawley rats with POI were used for in vivo experimental verification. The serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-, and MCP-1 were measured after surgery using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Western blot analysis was used to determine the expression of key proteins of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in colon tissues. RESULTS: An interaction network was constructed containing 7 Chinese medicine components, 36 compounds, and 85 target proteins. The functional enrichment analysis showed that the target proteins mainly acted on the POI through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In in vivo experiments, Tongfu decoction had a promoting effect on the serum level of IL-10, an inhibitory effect on the serum levels of IL-1 and CCL2, and an inhibitory effect on the local expression of PI3K, pAkt, and mTOR in colon tissue. In addition, the Tongfu decoction increased the intestinal ink advancing rate.

The objective of this study was to quantify and describe US adults who delayed dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional responses collected from a nationally representative and long-running panel survey of US adults conducted in late May and early June 2020 (response rate = 70%). The survey included questions about dental care delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, purpose of the delayed dental visits, timing of future dental visits, and demographic information. Pearson's chi-square tests were used to determine if rates of delayed dental care varied by subgroup. A multivariable regression model, adjusted for age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, census division, and rurality, was estimated to predict the odds of reporting delayed dental care. RESULTS: Nearly half of respondents (46.7%) reported delaying going to the dentist or receiving dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among adults who reported delaying dental care due to the pandemic, 74.7% reported delaying a checkup, 12.4% reported delaying care to address something that was bothering them, and 10.5% reported delaying care to get planned treatment. About 44.4% of adults reported that they planned to visit the dentist within the next 3 mo. In the multivariable regression model, only living in an urban (vs. rural) area was associated with significantly higher odds of delayed dental care due to the pandemic (odds ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 2.1).

Neglected hindfoot fractures have emerged as a consequence with increased frequency. Similarly, complex ankle and pilon fractures that require staged management, prolonged hospital stay, and soft-tissue care have emerged as a potential concern as prolonged exposure to healthcare setting adds to risk of acquiring as well as transmitting COVID-19 infection. The authors present their experience with expanding these indications for hindfoot arthrodesis as they encounter a greater number of neglected ankle and hindfoot trauma. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of collected data from the trauma unit of our hospital. Inclusion criteria included all trauma classified by the AO/OTA as occurring at locations 43, and who underwent subtalar and ankle arthrodesis. This included distal tibia, malleolar, talus, and calcaneus fractures. These patients were followed up to at least 6 months till complete fracture union. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients underwent arthrodesis of either the ankle or subtalar joint between March and October 2020. Mean age of patients undergoing arthrodesis of the hindfoot was 69.2 years (43C84 years). Indications for the procedure included Displaced and comminuted intra-articular distal tibia fractures in elderly (6 patients), Malunited ankle fractures (2 patients), Neglected Ankle fractures managed conservatively (3 patients), Calcaneus fractures (5 patients), and neglected Talus body fracture (2 patients). All patients were followed up to at least 6 months and everyone went onto successful painless union between 3 and 6 months of the arthrodesis procedure without any significant complications.

Claims from 288,515 patients, aged 45 years and older, without prior history of NDD or neurological surgery, were surveyed for a diagnosis of NDD starting 1 year following statin exposure. Patients were required to be enrolled with claims data for at least 6 months prior to first statin prescription and at least 3 years thereafter. Computational system biology analysis was conducted to determine unique target engagement for each statin. RESULTS: Of the 288,515 participants included in the study, 144,214 patients (mean [standard deviation (SD)] age, 67.22 [3.8] years) exposed to statin therapies, and 144,301 patients (65.97 [3.2] years) were not treated with statins. The mean (SD) follow\\\\up time was 5.1 (2.3) years.

To evaluate the efficacy of tumescent anesthesia in surgical excision of gynecomastia. Methods. A 4-year study with 100 patients of gynecomastia aged 14 to 47 years were enrolled with follow up for 3 months. All patients were given tumescence anesthesia in each breast comprising subcutaneous infiltration of 500 ml RL, 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine, 30 ml 2% lignocaine, 1 mg adrenaline & 1 gm tranexamic acid. Breast tissue was excised in each breast by a single infraareolar incision & patients were assessed for intra-op pain and post-op pain by using numeric rating scale (NRS). Results. Bilateral presentation was there in 69 patients and 31 unilateral with 4 recurrent cases. Size of gland excised were 12-14 cms in 53 cases, 15-18 cms in 38 & 19-20 cms in 9 patients.

At the same time, an understanding of CCH topics is crucial for physicians as they have clear implications for clinical practice and health care delivery. Although some medical schools have begun to incorporate CCH into curricula, the inclusion usually lacks a comprehensive framework for content and implementation. The authors propose a model for integrating CCH into medical school curricula using a practical, multi-stakeholder approach designed to mitigate competition for time with existing content by weaving meaningful CCH examples into current curricular activities. After the authors identified stakeholders to include in their curricular development working group, this working group determined the goals and desired outcomes of the curriculum; aligned those outcomes with the school's framework of educational objectives, competencies, and milestones; and strove to integrate CCH goals into as many existing curricular settings as possible.

BACKGROUND: Vitex negundo L. (VNL) is a medicinal plant with reported efficacy against respiratory diseases and some of the COVID-19 symptoms. Funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the University of the Philippines - Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) is currently conducting clinical trials of VNL and other medicinal plants as adjuvant therapeutic agents against mild cases of COVID-19. The basis for the clinical trials is primarily the pharmacological efficacy of the medicinal plants against respiratory disorders and associated COVID-19 symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the in silico potential of VNL components against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), an enzyme that plays an important role in COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2. METHOD: Phytochemical mining of VNL components from the literature was conducted. A database consisting of 250 known compounds from different parts of VNL was created and screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using the PyRx virtual screening tool. The most promising components were further subjected to in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) analyses using the SwissADME web server and Toxtree software. RESULTS: Virtual screening revealed that 102 VNL components in the database had comparable to or better binding affinities toward SARS-COV-2 Mpro than known chemical inhibitors (e.g. N3 and carmofur). It was determined that the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro receptor consists of multiple H-donor and acceptor sites; hence, the most stable receptor-ligand complexes are generally formed by VNL ligands that establish effective H-bonding with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The promising components, representing a \\"cocktail\\" of potential inhibitors also revealed interesting ADMET properties. CONCLUSION: This in silico study identified VNL as a potential single source of a cocktail of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors and a promising adjuvant therapeutic agent against COVID-19 or its symptoms. Furthermore, the study offers a rationale on phytochemical mining from medicinal plants as a means that can be implemented in the early stage of a drug discovery and development program.","output":"Discovery of a \\"Cocktail\\" of Potential SARS-COV-2 Main Protease Inhibitors through Virtual Screening of Known Chemical Components of Vitex negundo L.

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the practices of DI clinics, and investigate the reasons for the change in their operations during the initial period of the pandemic starting in mid-March 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was created and distributed to the managers of eighteen outpatient DI clinics in London, Hamilton, and Halton, Ontario, Canada. The managers indicated whether their clinics had closed or decreased operations, the reasons for closure, and the types of imaging examinations conducted in the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Fifty percent of the DI clinics surveyed (9/18) closed as a result of COVID-19, and those that remained open had decreased hours of operation. The clinics that closed indicated decreased referrals as the primary reason for closure, followed by staff shortage, concerns for safety, and suspension of elective imaging. Chest radiography and obstetric ultrasound were the most commonly conducted examinations. Clinics that were in close geographical proximity were able to redistribute imaging examinations amongst themselves. All DI clinics had suspended BMD examinations and elective breast screening, and some transitioned to booked appointments only. CONCLUSION: Many DI clinics needed to close or decrease operations as a result of COVID-19, a phenomenon that is unprecedented in radiological practice. The results of this study can assist outpatient DI clinics in preparing for subsequent waves of COVID-19, future pandemics, and other periods of crisis.","output":"Investigating the initial effect of COVID-19 on the functioning of outpatient diagnostic imaging facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3C-like protease (3CL(pro) or M(pro)) is an attractive target for the development of anti-SARS drugs because of its crucial role in the viral life cycle.

Psychological distress is a known risk factor for problem gambling as it can motivate excessive gambling as a coping response. The availability of gambling is considered a factor in maintaining problems. This paper aimed to investigate the impact of the shutdown of gambling venues on Australians, particularly among those vulnerable to mental health problems and gambling disorder. METHODS: Australian adults who had gambled at least once in the past 12 months (N = 764, 85.2% male) completed an online cross-sectional survey. Self-report measures retrospectively assessed typical monthly gambling frequency and expenditure before and after the COVID-19 venue shutdown, problem gambling, and psychological distress. RESULTS: Significant median decreases in gambling frequency were observed, both online and overall. No relationship was found between psychological distress and baseline or increases in gambling. Greater problem gambling severity was related to higher baseline gambling, but not to increases in gambling. Exploratory analysis showed that individuals engaged in moderate-risk gambling, but not problem gambling, were more likely to report increased gambling frequency compared to nonproblem and low-risk gamblers combined. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide important insights into how changes in availability influence gambling participation, and for understanding the effectiveness of forced restrictions and venue exclusion strategies. Most people moderated their gambling when venue-based gambling was unavailable and opportunities for sports betting were limited. However, harms experienced by individuals with some gambling problems may have been exacerbated during the period of limited access. Policies to enhance prevention and treatment of gambling problems are necessary even when availability is reduced.","output":"Impacts of the COVID-19 Shutdown on Gambling Patterns in Australia: Consideration of Problem Gambling and Psychological Distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regenerative medicine uses the biological and medical knowledge on how the cells and tissue regenerate and evolve in order to develop novel therapies.

After two vaccinations, the antibody response, T-cell responses, and number of follicular helper T-cells (Tfh) or germinal center (GC) B cells were assessed in mice; the protective efficacy was evaluated on a Syrian hamster infection model. The mouse studies demonstrated that adjuvating the S-Trimer with SWE induced a potent humoral immune response and Th1-biased cellular immune responses (in low dose) that were superior to those induced by Alum. In the Syrian hamster studies, when S-Trimer was adjuvanted with SWE, higher levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced against live SARS-CoV-2 from the original lineage and against the emergence of variants (Beta or Delta) with a slightly decreased potency. In addition, the SWE adjuvant demonstrated a dose-sparing effect; thus, a lower dose of S-Trimer as an antigen (0.5 g) can induce comparable antisera and provide complete protection from viral infection.

Continuous monitoring of the virus has become a cornerstone to make rational decisions on implementing societal and sanitary measures to curtail the virus spread. Additionally, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have increased the need for genomic surveillance to detect particular strains because of their potentially increased transmissibility, pathogenicity and immune escape. Targeted SARS-CoV-2 sequencing of wastewater has been explored as an epidemiological surveillance method for the competent authorities. Few quality criteria are however available when sequencing wastewater samples, and those available typically only pertain to constructing the consensus genome sequence. Multiple variants circulating in the population can however be simultaneously present in wastewater samples. The performance, including detection and quantification of low-abundant variants, of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples remains largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the detection and quantification of mutations present at low abundances using the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (alpha variant) defining mutations as a case study. Real sequencing data were in silico modified by introducing mutations of interest into raw wild-type sequencing data, or by mixing wild-type and mutant raw sequencing data, to mimic wastewater samples subjected to WGS using a tiling amplicon-based targeted metagenomics approach and Illumina sequencing. As anticipated, higher variation, lower sensitivity and more false negatives, were observed at lower coverages and allelic frequencies. We found that detection of all low-frequency variants at an abundance of 10%, 5%, 3% and 1%, requires at least a sequencing coverage of 250X, 500X, 1500X and 10,000X, respectively. Although increasing variability of estimated allelic frequencies at decreasing coverages and lower allelic frequencies was observed, its impact on reliable quantification was limited.

The room space is occupied by ten people, with eight people sitting around a conference table and two people standing. Four different scenarios are considered, with the air-conditioning turned on/off and people wearing/not-wearing masks, to understand the spread of respiratory droplets inside the room. The flow in the room is simulated using a multiphase mixture model with properties computed for the inhaled and exhaled air using fundamental gas relations. The transport of respiratory droplets is analyzed using the discrete phase model with a range of droplet sizes fitted to data from previous experimental studies.

The human inhalation and exhalation are modeled using analytical functions to mimic the biological flow patterns during breathing, coughing, and talking. Important observations about the air flow and dispersion of respiratory droplets in the conference room are presented based on the numerical analysis. Animations of all the results are included to provide insight into flow physics of the various dynamic conditions occurring in the room during an ongoing meeting.

Based on preferential attachment mechanism, we further introduce a model to mimic the growth of cascades. The proposed model enables the interpolation between broadcast and viral spreading during the growth of cascades. Through numerical simulations, we show the effectiveness of the proposed model in characterizing the virality of growing cascades.

OBJECTIVES: This pre-implementation study sought to assess the proportion of patients eligible for DSD and HIV services utilization, as well as risk factor analysis of virologic failure in Sierra Leone. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of adult HIV-infected patients aged 18 years and older receiving care at the largest HIV treatment center in Sierra Leone 2019C2020. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify predictors of virologic failure. RESULTS: Of 586 unique patients reviewed, 210 (35.8%) qualified as stable for antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery. There was high utilization of certain HIV service programs (e.g. HIV status disclosure to partners (83%) and treatment buddy program participation (62.8%)), while other service programs (e.g. partner testing and community HIV support group participation) had low utilization (<50%). Of 429 patients with available viral load, 277 (64.6%) were virologically suppressed. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors of virologic failure, CD4 < 350 cells/mm(3) (p = 0.009), atazanavir-based ART (p = 0.032), once monthly versus once two- or three-monthly ART dispensing (p = 0.028), history of ART switching (p = 0.02), poor adherence (p = 0.001) and not having received adherence support (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of virologic failure. CONCLUSION: Approximately one in three HIV-infected patients on ART were eligible for DSD. We identified gaps in HIV care (i.e. low partner testing, treatment buddy, program participation and a substantially high rate of virologic failure) that need to be addressed in preparation for full implementation of DSD in Sierra Leone.","output":"Assessing eligibility for differentiated service delivery, HIV services utilization and virologic outcomes of adult HIV-infected patients in Sierra Leone: a pre-implementation analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 70-year-old woman was diagnosed with cT2N2M0 left triple negative breast cancer.

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impact of IL-6 inhibition on mortality from COVID-19, utilising meta-regression to explore differences in study results. METHODS: : Systematic database searches were performed to identify RCTs comparing IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) to placebo or standard of care in adults with COVID-19. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality at 28 days between arms, expressed as a risk ratio. Within-study mortality rates were compared, and meta-regression was used to investigate treatment effect modification. RESULTS: : Data from nine RCTs were included. The combined mortality rate across studies was 19% (95% CI: 18, 20%), ranging from 2% to 31%. The overall risk ratio for 28-day mortality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), in favour of benefit for IL-6 inhibition over placebo or standard of care, with low treatment effect heterogeneity: I(2) 0% (95% CI: 0, 53%). Meta-regression showed no evidence of treatment effect modification by patient characteristics. Trial-specific mortality rates were explained by known patient-level predictors of COVID-19 outcome (male sex, CRP, hypertension), and country-level COVID-19 incidence.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper presents the results of a survey conducted during the pandemic among 123 employees working for organisations of various kinds. The questionnaire survey was carried out using the computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) methodology. The process was based on certain claims of grounded theory. Statistical analysis was carried out using basic methods of descriptive statistics, statistical tests and selected methods of multivariate statistics, including the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy, Bartlett's Test of Sphericity. Findings: The overall level of organisational engagement in organisations that operated during the pandemic was rated as moderate by the respondents, with the most favourably assessed issues including communication between employees and supervisors, sense of job stability, concern for the fate of the organisation, mutual inspiration to work, and employees' sense of satisfaction with being part of the organisation. The results also revealed statistically significant correlations between the different elements of organisational engagement. Practical Implications: The practical implications that arise from the results obtained in the study concern mainly the role of organisational engagement for effective operations of an organisation, including during a crisis situation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that taking action to improve communication and cooperation, promoting the policy of equal opportunities and capabilities, fair treatment and evaluation of employees and many other instruments can foster the development of employee engagement, which brings results in the form of higher level of job satisfaction, stability and efficiency, thus improving the operations of the organisation.

Most of these findings were reported during the 2009 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to detail the clinical characteristics of influenza virus-induced lower respiratory infection (LRI) during the A(H1N1)pdm09-predominant 2015C2016 season. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics of influenza-induced LRI cases in children admitted to a tertiary children's hospital. Molecular diagnostic evaluation was performed on samples obtained from the most severe cases. RESULTS: We identified 66 patients with influenza-associated hospitalization and included 21 patients with influenza virus-induced LRI for analyses. Twelve patients (57%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, seven (33%) required mechanical ventilation, and three (14%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plastic bronchitis (PB) was identified in six patients (29%), among whom a past medical history of asthma or food allergy were noted in all six patients. A past history of allergic disease was more common among patients with, than among those without, PB (p = 0.009). A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected from all the PB cases, and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes demonstrated that this virus belonged to subclades 6B.1 and 6B.2. In the six PB cases, we found one patient with H275Y mutation in neuraminidase.

The aim of this study was to assess the posttreatment risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in a population of patients operated on for colorectal cancer 3 months before the COVID-19 outbreak and who after hospitalization returned to an environment where the virus was circulating. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This French, multicenter cohort study included consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer between January 1 and March 31, 2020, at 19 GRECCAR hospitals. The outcome was the rate of COVID-19 infection in this group of patients who were followed until June 15, 2020. RESULTS: This study included 448 patients, 262 male (58.5%) and 186 female (41.5%), who underwent surgery for colon cancer (n = 290, 64.7%), rectal cancer (n = 155, 34.6%), or anal cancer (n = 3, 0.7%). The median age was 68 years (19-95). Comorbidities were present in nearly half of the patients, 52% were at least overweight, and the median BMI was 25 (12-42).

In the following months, the pressure on healthcare systems in Spain continued although it did not reach the extreme levels of the first weeks of the pandemic. In this study, we proposed to determine if the severity of Covid-19 outcomes in MM patients has changed over the first year of the pandemic. Patients and methods The Spanish MM Collaborative Group (Pethema-GEM) conducted a survey at national level on plasma cell disorder patients infected by SARS-Cov-2 between March 2020 and February 2021. Sixty-six (69%) out of 96 contacted healthcare centers, from all 17 regions in Spain, reported 502 patients. Data on Covid-19 acute and post-acute phase outcomes (hospitalization, oxygen requirements, severity of symptoms and mortality) were reported first in May 2020 (Martinez-Lopez et al, BCJ 2021) and updated in February 2021. In this study, we compared outcome occurrence between two study periods: P1, a period of extreme stress for the healthcare system in Spain, from March to mid-June 2020; and a second period, P2, up to mid-February 2021 with a sustained but lower burden on the national health care system. Results Among the 451 patients with plasma cell disorders and a Sars-Cov-2 infection documented with an rRT-PCR positive test, 377 (84%) were MM patients, 15 SMM (3%), 40 MGUS (9%) and 19 amyloidosis (4%). The number of MM weekly reported cases was 57% (95%CI, 48-65) lower in P2 (188 cases in 35 weeks) compared to P1 (189 cases in 15 weeks), p<0.001. The mean (SD) age and the proportion of men did not differ between P1 and P2, respectively 69.8 (10.9) vs 68.6 (11.0) years, p=0.6, and 53.3% vs 59.6%, p=0.2. MM patients with active or progressive disease at time of Covid-19 diagnosis were 24% in P1 and 34% in P2, p=0.05; patients on active treatment were more frequent in P1, 89%, than in P2, 79%, p=0.01. MM treatment was withheld in 78% and 82% of patients, p=0.4. Covid-19 treatment changed over time: MM inpatients received more remdesivir and corticoids in the second period (3% vs 31% p<0.001, and 49% vs 73%, p<0.001, respectively). In P1, 90% of the reported MM patients were hospitalized compared to 71% in P2, p<0.001. Thirty-one and 41% of patients did not require oxygen support during P1 and P2, respectively; non-invasive ventilation in 19% and 14%, and mechanical ventilation in 7% and 8%, p=0.12. Overall, acute clinical Covid-19 severity was reduced from P1 to P2: 75% to 51%, p<0.001: moderate/severe pneumonia was reduced from 68% to 36%, p<0.001 but severe distress syndrome increased from 7% to 15%, p=0.03. However, mortality in all reported patients was 30.7% in P1 vs 26.1% in P2, p=0.3; and no differences in mortality were observed in hospitalized patients, 32.2% in P1 and 35.3% in P2, p=0.6. We performed a multivariable adjustment with the predictors identified in our previous study (BCJ 2021) and confirmed that inpatient mortality was similar in both study periods, odds ratio (OR) 0.99 (95%CI 0.59-1.66). Independently of the study period, an increased mortality was observed in men (OR 1.81, 1.08-3.05), patients over 65 (OR 2.40, 1.33-4.36), and patients with active or progressive disease (OR 2.12, 1.24-3.62). The severity of Covid-19 clinical outcomes -besides mortality, was associated with increased age but not with active or progressive disease. Conclusions Although COVID-19 clinical severity has decreased over the first year of the pandemic in multiple myeloma patients, mortality remains high with no change between the initial weeks of the pandemic and the following months. Prevention and vaccination strategies should be strengthened in this vulnerable population, particularly in patients with active or progressive disease at time of Covid-19 diagnosis.

The research presented here provides analysis of the ethical challenges with regard to allocation of limited resources, particularly experimental therapeutics, using the 2013-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa as a case study. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior healthcare personnel (n = 16) from international humanitarian aid organizations intimately engaged in the 2013-2016 EVD outbreak response in West Africa. Interviews were recorded in private setting, transcribed, and iteratively coded using grounded theory methodology.

Respondents agreed that prioritization of frontline workers' access to experimental therapeutics was warranted based on a principle of reciprocity. There was widespread acceptance of adaptive trial designs and greater trial transparency in providing access to experimental therapeutics. Many respondents also emphasized the importance of community engagement in limited resource allocation scheme design and culturally appropriate informed consent procedures.

Morbidity and mortality of non-COVID-19 emergencies might also have changed because hospitals may not be able to provide optimal care due to restructured resources and uncertainties how to deal with potentially infected patients. It has been recommended to stratify treatment of cardiovascular emergencies according to cardiovascular risk. However, data on the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients presenting with cardiac emergencies remain scarce. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients' data from a tertiary cardiology department between April 15 and May 31, 2020.

This finding might be helpful to better determine timing of emergency procedures and reasonable usage of protective equipment during the COVID-19 crisis and the future.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Asymptomatic Patients Hospitalized for Cardiac Emergencies: Implications for Patient Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In freeze-etch replicas of epithelial cells of rat rectum, the fuzzy surface coat is composed of discrete filaments which are aligned in parallel with each other and with the long axes of the microvilli.","output":"Demonstration of the fuzzy surface coat of rat intestinal microvilli by freeze-etching."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 cases are pervasive. Some minority, immigrant, and marginalized groups, such as Arab Americans, have been excluded from the research. This population confronts barriers to health care, discrimination, and other factors that may affect understanding, testing, and treatment as it relates to COVID-19. Arab Americans are unique compared to Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and Asians because Arab Americans do not have a specific ethnic identifier and are classified as non-Hispanic white. Given these issues, this study will estimate COVID-19 cases and examine associations among Arab Americans compared to Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Asian adults. Data from the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (March 2020CJuly 2021), the American Community Survey (2015C2019), and an Arab/Chaldean surname algorithm were used. Chi-square tests were used to determine statistically significant differences between groups. Logistic regression was used to estimate age-adjusted and sex-stratified proportions among Arab Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites before and after adjusting for age and sex. Approximately 17% of Arab Americans tested positive for COVID-19 compared to 11.32% of Hispanics, 9.80% of non-Hispanic blacks, 7.50% of non-Hispanic whites, and 4.24% of Asians. Arab Americans had 2.63 (95% CI: 2.59, 2.66) times greater odds of testing positive for COVID-19 compared to non-Hispanic whites.

The study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of pediatric Hematology/Oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic as a reflection of the quality of health care services and to assess anxiety levels and its impact on HRQoL. Methods: : a cross-sectional study of 292 Egyptian children between 2.5 - 13 years with chronic hematological/oncological disorders categorized as bleeding/coagulation disorders, transfusion-dependent patients, and patients receiving chemotherapy. Validated Arabic versions of Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scale and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale were used for assessment of HRQoL and anxiety, respectively. Results: : the mean age was 8.72  3.66 years, 52.4% were males and 65.4% were transfusion-dependent patients. Almost 60% of children were aware of the pandemic and 60.3% had blood transfusion difficulties. Males had significantly lower anxiety levels than females ( p < 0.001), and transfusion-dependent patients also had significantly lower anxiety levels than patients receiving chemotherapy ( p < 0.001). Children who were aware of the COVID-19 pandemic had lower anxiety levels than those who were not ( p = 0.006), while those suffering from fewer clinic days had higher anxiety levels ( p = 0.02). Several factors have been shown to affect the HRQoL in the three patients categories and anxiety significantly reduced the three HRQoL domains ( p < 0.001). The overall emotional functioning score was better than the physical and social aspects.

Methods Between June and August 2020, an agent-based model was used to project rates of COVID-19 infection incidence and cases diagnosed as positive from 15 September to 31 October 2020 for 72 geographic settings. Five scenarios were modelled: a baseline scenario where no future changes were made to existing restrictions, and four scenarios representing small or moderate changes in restrictions at two intervals. Post hoc, upper and lower bounds for number of diagnosed Covid-19 cases were compared with actual data collected during the prediction window. A regression analysis with 17 covariates was performed to determine correlates of accurate projections. Results The actual data fell within the lower and upper bounds in 27 settings and out of bounds in 45 settings. The only statistically significant predictor of actual data within the predicted bounds was correct assumptions about future policy changes (OR = 15.04; 95%CI 2.20-208.70; p=0.016). Conclusions For this study, the accuracy of COVID-19 model projections was dependent on whether assumptions about future policies are correct. Frequent changes in restrictions implemented by governments, which the modelling team was not always able to predict, in part explains why the majority of model projections were inaccurate compared with actual outcomes and supports revision of projections when policies are changed as well as the importance of policy experts collaborating on modelling projects.","output":"Predicting the unpredictable: how dynamic COVID-19 policies and restrictions challenge model forecasts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I would like to welcome our readers to volume 11 of Pain Management.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic analysis of mortality and morbidity data for LRI and its specific etiologic factors, including pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. We used modeling methods to estimate incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We calculated burden attributable to known risk factors for LRI. RESULTS: In 2015, LRIs were the fourth-leading cause of DALYs, causing 11,098,243 (95% UI 9,857,095C12,396,566) DALYs and 191,114 (95% UI 170,934C210,705) deaths. The LRI DALY rates were higher than global estimates in 2015. The highest and lowest age-standardized rates of DALYs were observed in Somalia and Lebanon, respectively.

A new service model was temporarily agreed as a result of COVID-19, without routine use of POCT. OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of removing the requirement for GAS POCT from a community pharmacy STTT service on antibiotic supply. METHODS: Analysis of STTT consultation data, obtained for two periods: November 2018 (date the service went live) to September 2019 (pre-pandemic); and November 2020 (date the new service model was introduced) to May 2021. RESULTS: For consultations eligible for POCT, the antibiotic supply rate increased from 27% (922/3369) (95% CI: 26%C29%) with the pre-pandemic service model (FeverPAIN/Centor + POCT) to 63% (93/147) (95% CI: 55%C71%) with the new model (FeverPAIN/Centor only); the percentage of patients who were not issued an antibiotic, despite their high clinical score, decreased from 56% (646/1154) to 9.3% (8/86). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggest that for every 100 STTT consultations with patients with a Centor score of 3 or a FeverPAIN score of 2, the use of POCT may spare up to 36 courses of antibiotics, increasing to 47 for patients with higher clinical scores, suggesting that the pre-COVID delivery model (FeverPAIN/Centor + POCT) is the optimal pathway and POCT in addition to clinical scores may result in fewer antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat symptoms. These findings have implications for STTT service delivery during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"To swab or not to swab?

It is unclear whether this is driven by an increased risk of infection or complications. We therefore aimed to investigate the incidence of clinically diagnosed influenza/influenza-like illness (ILI) by ethnicity in England from 2008-2018. Methods: We used linked primary and secondary healthcare data (from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] GOLD and Aurum databases and Hospital Episodes Statistics Admitted Patient Care [HES APC]). We included patients with recorded ethnicity who were aged 40-64 years and did not have a chronic health condition that would render them eligible for influenza vaccination. ILI infection was identified from diagnostic codes in CPRD and HES APC. We calculated crude annual infection incidence rates by ethnic group. Multivariable Poisson regression models with random effects were used to estimate any ethnic disparities in infection risk. Our main analysis adjusted for age, sex, and influenza year. Results: A total of 3,735,308 adults aged 40-64 years were included in the study; 87.6% White, 5.2% South Asian, 4.2% Black, 1.9% Other, and 1.1% Mixed. We identified 102,316 ILI episodes recorded among 94,623 patients. The rate of ILI was highest in the South Asian (9.6 per 1,000 person-years), Black (8.4 per 1,000 person-years) and Mixed (6.9 per 1,000 person-years) ethnic groups. The ILI rate in the White ethnic group was 5.7 per 1,000 person-years. After adjustment for age sex and influenza year, higher incidence rate ratios (IRR) for ILI were seen for South Asian (1.70, 95% CI 1.66-1.75), Black (1.48, 1.44-1.53) and Mixed (1.22, 1.15-1.30) groups compared to White ethnicity.

INTERVENTIONS: A temporal coronavirus disease 2019 test positive cut point of June 1 was used to separate the development from validation cohorts. Fine and Gray competing risk regression modeling was performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The development set contained 4,520 patients who tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 between March 8, 2020, and May 31, 2020. The validation set contained 3,150 patients who tested positive between June 1 and July 13. Approximately 9% of patients were admitted to the ICU or died of coronavirus disease 2019 within 2 weeks of testing positive. A prediction cut point of 15% was proposed.

Two types of hemoperfusion cartridges used in this study were Jafron? (HA330) and CytoSorb? 300. RESULT: A total of 128 COVID-19-confirmed patients were enrolled in this study; 73 patients were allotted to the matched group and 55 patients received hemoperfusion. The median SPO2 at the admission day in the control and hemoperfusion groups was 80% and 75%, respectively (p value = 0.113). The mortality rate was significantly lower in the hemoperfusion group compared to the matched group (67.3% vs. 89%; p value = 0.002). The median length of ICU stay was statistically different in studied groups (median, 12 days for hemoperfusion group vs. 8 days for the matched group; p < 0.001). The median final SPO2 was statistically higher in the hemoperfusion group than in the matched group, and the median PaCO2 was lower. CONCLUSION: Among critically ill COVID-19 patients, based on our study, the use of hemoperfusion may reduce the mortality rate and improve SPO2 and PaCO2.","output":"Efficacy of Hemoperfusion in Severe and Critical Cases of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years. Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.","output":"Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People with bipolar disorder (BD) frequently struggle with the recurrence of affective symptoms. However, the interplay between coping mechanism and positive mood state remains under-researched. AIM: To explore the associations among behavioral approach system (BAS) sensitivity level, coping, and positive mood states among people with BD. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, 90 participants with BD were presented with four BAS-activating life event scenarios and assessed with regard to their BAS trait sensitivity, coping flexibility, and mood states. A hierarchical clustering method was used to identify different groups with different styles of coping. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the mediating and moderating roles of different components of coping on mood states. RESULTS: A three-cluster solution was found to best fit the present data set. The findings showed that a low mass of coping combined with low BAS sensitivity level protects people with BD from detrimentally accentuating mood states when they encounter BAS-activating life events. Moreover, coping flexibility is demonstrated to mediate and moderate the relationships between BAS sensitivity level and mood states. Specifically, subduing the perceived controllability and reducing the use of behavioral-activation/emotion-amplifying coping strategies could help buffer the effect of positive affect. CONCLUSION: The judicious use of coping in emotion regulation for people with BD when encountering BAS-activating life events was indicated. Practical applications and theoretical implications are highlighted.","output":"Evaluating the emotion regulation of positive mood states among people with bipolar disorder using hierarchical clustering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores Ohio Early Childhood and Care (ECEC) workers perspectives about different prioritization for COVID-19 vaccine distribution between Ohio educators employed in ECEC and prek-12 settings.

We document an overview of methodologies developed and deployed in the Myanmar Snakebite Project, a foreign aid project largely funded by the Australian Government, with the core aim to \\"improve outcomes for snakebite patients\\". A multidisciplinary team of experts was assembled that worked in a collaborative manner with colleagues in Myanmar, first to identify problems related to managing snakebite and then develop interventions aimed to improve selected problem areas. A broad approach was adopted, covering antivenom production, antivenom distribution and health system management of snakebite. Problems identified in antivenom production included poor snake husbandry resulting in poor survival of captive specimens, lack of geographical diversity; poor horse husbandry, resulting in high mortality, inadequate stock acquisition protocols and data collection, and inappropriate immunisation and bleeding techniques; and inadequate production capacity for freeze dried antivenoms and quality control systems. These problems were addressed in various ways, resulting in some substantial improvements. Antivenom distribution is being reorganised to achieve better availability and utilisation of stock. Health system management of snakebite was assessed across all levels within the area selected for the study, in Mandalay region. A comprehensive community survey indicated that hospital statistics substantially underestimated the snakebite burden, and that access to care by local villagers was delayed by transport and cost issues compounded by lack of antivenom at the most peripheral level of the health service. A health system survey confirmed under-resourcing at the local village level. Prospective case data collection initiated at tertiary hospitals indicated the extent of the snakebite burden on health resources. Interventions initiated or planned include training of health staff, development of a core of senior trainers who can \\"train the trainers\\" nationwide in a sustainable way, development and deployment of management guidelines and algorithms for snakebite and a distribution of solar powered fridges to remote health facilities to allow storage of antivenom and prompt treatment of snakebite cases before transfer to major hospitals, thereby reducing the \\"bite to needle\\" time.","output":"A comprehensive approach to managing a neglected, neglected tropical disease; The Myanmar Snakebite Project (MSP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, we reported a low seroprevalence of N-specific antibodies in 4147 health care workers (HCWs) at a frontline hospital in Tokyo, Japan.

In 2021, N-specific seroprevalence remains as low as 1.59%. The seroprevalences were comparable among all HCWs regardless of exposure levels. Almost all of the HCWs elicited S-specific antibodies after vaccination. However, the HCWs who had COVID-19 elicited higher S-specific antibody titers than those who did not have COVID-19. In the HCWs without a history of COVID-19, 1.1% (23 out of 2185) were seropositive with N-specific antibodies, indicating the existence of asymptomatic infections. Also, S-specific antibody titers were higher in females and younger HCWs, and in those who had severe side effects.

Early identification of developmental delay using validated screening instruments provides a pathway to prevention and intervention in pediatric health care settings. However, the validity of Spanish-language screening instruments, used in clinical settings in the United States, has not been systematically examined. OBJECTIVE This study aims to review the literature of clinically administered developmental and behavioral instruments with Hispanic caregivers to investigate implementation variation due to language and cultural factors. METHODS A systematic literature review using PubMed and PsycINFO was conducted of articles published from January 1, 2006 to December 12, 2017. Abstract, full-text, and critical appraisal resulted in 11 studies that met criteria for inclusion. RESULTS Five different instruments were used to screen Hispanic or Spanish-speaking caregivers of children younger than 6 years. None of the instruments established validity and reliability apart from Spanish translation. Two studies identified differences in screening results with Spanish-speaking caregivers due to language and 6 described cultural differences that impacted screening implementation. Two studies reported differential item functioning in Spanish-translated instruments. CONCLUSIONS Language and cultural considerations are critical to the administration of valid and reliable screening in pediatric health care settings. Available developmental and behavioral Spanish-language-screening instruments function differently because of both language and culture, suggesting the tools are not as psychometrically valid when administered to Spanish-speaking families. Validation of translated screening instruments is essential to eliminate the possibility of detection bias or misidentification of developmental risk, improving early access to clinical services for Hispanic and Spanish-speaking families.","output":"Screening Instruments for Developmental and Behavioral Concerns in Pediatric Hispanic Populations in the United States: A Systematic Literature Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies of mergers and acquisitions have struggled to identify characteristics of M&A transactions that are consistently associated with positive returns for buyers The authors report the findings of their study of buyers' gain in fire sales by examining the stock price reaction to corporate announcements of acquisitions of distressed companies or their assets During the period from 1982 to 2012, buyer returns were approximately two percentage points higher in fire sales than in regular M&A transactions The explanation of this result is shown to be the reduction in the sellers' bargaining power Consistent with that explanation, the authors found no difference in either the operating profitability of the buyers after acquisitions, or in the combined announcement returns of buyers and sellers between fire sales and regular acquisitions, suggesting that the quality of the match is similar in both types of transactions For corporate practitioners, one implication of these findings is that corporate acquirersand not just the private equity firms that focus on distressed companiesshould consider the purchase of distressed assets as a value\\\\adding way of deploying capital From a public policy perspective, the spillover costs associated with fire sales for the distressed seller's suppliers and customers are roughly comparable to those in regular M&A deals Moreover, fire sales do not depress the asset values of other companies in the seller's industry In sum, the welfare losses associated with fire sales are smaller than previously thought, which in turn casts doubt on the $1 8 trillion of federal bailout funds appropriated in response to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic as the best use of taxpayer money","output":"The Benefits of Buying Distressed Assets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is the name of the coronavirus that initially appeared in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019.

STUDY DESIGN In vivo experimental study. STUDY POPULATION Nine horses donated for medical conditions unrelated to respiratory system. METHODS The triangle-tip knife was applied in contact fashion. Left VC was performed under standing sedation. Endoscopic images of the upper airway were graded for inflammation by 2 masked surgeons preoperatively and immediately, 24 hours and, in 2 cases, 7 and 14 days postoperatively. Four larynxes were examined for histological evidence of inflammation and collagen deposition at 24 hours (n = 2) and at 14 days (n = 2) after surgery. RESULTS Ventriculocordectomy was successfully performed in all horses. Endoscopic evidence of inflammation was scored as normal (preoperatively), mild (immediately postoperatively), mild (24 hours postoperatively), mild (7 days postoperatively), and normal (14 days postoperatively). According to histopathology, inflammation of the surgical site and ventricularis muscle was generally increased (variable is common and is present in most high-power fields) 24 hours and 14 days postoperatively.

However, these traditional chalcogen doping can only take the place of a sulfur element and not essentially change the inherent electrical nature of MoS2. Herein, novel Te-MoS2 materials have been synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process under Te doping. A half-metallic Te occupies the position of an Mo atom to form Te-S bonds, which is different from the same group Se element. After theoretical modeling and electrochemical measurements, it was observed that the formation of Te-S bonds can increase the electrical conductivity (about 530 times increment) and mitigate the mechanical stress to ensure the whole structural stability during the repeated insertion/extraction of K-ions. Moreover, the insertion of Te into the lattice of MoS2 generated the fractional phase transformation from 2H to the 1T phase of MoS2 and 1T&2H in-plane hetero-junction. Benefiting from these advantages, the 1T&2H Te-MoS2 anode delivered high capacities of 718 and 342 mA h g-1 at 50 and 5000 mA g-1, respectively, and an ultra-stable cycling performance (88.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1).

We used random-effects models to calculate the 95% confidence intervals of pooled estimated prevalence and the odds ratio between the severe and nonsevere cases. RESULTS Ninety studies involving 16,526 COVID-19 patients were included. Hypertension (19.1%) and diabetes (9.5%) were the most common comorbidities. The most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever (78.4%), cough (58.5%), and fatigue (26.4%). Increased serum ferritin (74.2%), high C-reactive protein (73.3%), and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (72.2%) were the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities. Most patients had bilateral lung involvement (82.2%) and showed peripheral (66.9%) and subpleural (62.1%) distribution, with multifocal involvement (73.1%). And the most common CT features were vascular enlargement (64.3%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (60.7%), and thickened interlobular septa (55.1%). Respiratory failure was the most common complication (30.7%) and the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 4.2%. Moreover, male, history of smoking, and comorbidities might influence the prognosis. Most clinical symptoms such as fever, high fever, cough, sputum production, fatigue, shortness of breath, dyspnoea, and abdominal pain were linked to the severity of disease.

There is a need for alternative disinfection strategies and techniques that are adapted to the actual behavior of humans living in densely populated mega-cities. Here, high public circulation in shared passenger vehicles such as taxis, buses and personal cars represents a major risk of viral transmission due to confined space and commonly touched surfaces. Actual regulatory guidelines are not fully successful because they rely both on passengers' willingness to wear face masks and on drivers' willingness to disinfect cars after each shift or each ride with symptomatic individuals. Here we propose that passive solar heating, a sustainable technique that has been used in agronomy to kill weeds and soil pathogens, could inactivate the virus in vehicles during warm-to-hot weather within few minutes to half an hour at 50-60 C. We measured temperatures in a white compact-size sedan left in a parking lot under direct sunlight.

Temperatures were about 3 C higher in front versus back of the car and about 5 C higher at face height compared to knee height. Since COVID-19 is inactivated in 30 min at 56 C, our findings confirm that hot air generated passively by solar heating in enclosed spaces is a promising strategy of disinfection with benefits of no added costs, chemicals or worktime.

RESULTS: We found that zebrafish tp53 mutant larvae exhibited elevated intestinal inflammation, by monitoring the NFB activity in the mid-distal intestines of zebrafish larvae using an NFB:EGFP transgenic reporter line in vivo as well as neutrophil infiltration into the intestine. This inflammation was due to dysbiotic gut microbiota with reduced diversity, revealed using both 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and a germfree larva model. In this dysbiosis, Aeromonas spp. were aberrantly enriched as major pathobionts and exhibited the capacity for aggressive colonization in tp53 mutants. Importantly, the ex-germfree experiments supported the causality of the host tp53 mutation for inducing the inflammation. Transcriptome and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses of the host gastrointestinal tracts identified dysregulated sialic acid (SA) metabolism concomitant with increased host Neu5Gc levels as the key determinant of aberrant inflammation, which was reversed by the sialidase inhibitors oseltamivir and Philippin A. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a crucial role for host tp53 in maintaining symbiosis and immune homeostasis via SA metabolism. Disturbed SA metabolism via a tp53 mutation may be exploited by specific elements of the gut microbiome, eliciting both dysbiosis and inflammation. Manipulating sialometabolism may therefore provide an efficacious therapeutic strategy for tp53 mutation-induced dysbiosis, inflammation, and ultimately, related cancers.

In our view, understanding these ethical issues demands a perspective that looks beyond the technology itself to include the sociotechnical system in which it is situated. In this sense, a sociotechnical system refers to the broader collection of material devices, interpersonal relationships, organizational policies, corporate contracts, and government regulations that shape the ways in which digital health technologies are adopted and used. Bioethical approaches to the assessment of digital health technologies are typically confined to ethical issues raised by features of the technology itself. We suggest that an ethical perspective confined to functions of the technology is insufficient to assess the broader impact of the adoption of technologies on the care environment and the broader health-related ecosystem of which it is a part. In this paper we review existing approaches to the bioethics of digital health, and draw on concepts from design ethics and science & technology studies (STS) to critique a narrow view of the bioethics of digital health. We then describe the sociotechnical system produced by digital health technologies when adopted in health care environments, and outline the various considerations that demand attention for a comprehensive ethical analysis of digital health technologies in this broad perspective.

Engl J Med 2020a;382:1199C207, Nature 2020;579:270C3). SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is essential to controlling widespread transmission. However, there are several challenges associated with the diagnostic of the COVID-19 during the current outbreak (Liu and Li (2019), Nature 2020;579:265C9, N. Engl J Med 2020;382:727C33). Firstly, the high number of cases overwhelms diagnostic test capacity and proposes the need for a rapid solution for sample processing (Science 2018;360:444C8). Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other important coronavirus species and subspecies, so detection assays can give false-positive results if they are not efficiently specific to SARS-CoV-2. Thirdly, patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection sometimes have a different respiratory viral infection or co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (MedRxiv 2020a;1C18). Confirmation of the COVID-19 is performed mainly by virus isolation followed by RT-PCR and sequencing (N. Engl J Med 2020;382:727C33, MedRxiv 2020a, Turkish J Biol 2020;44:192C202).

PARTICIPANTS: 570 participants (mean age: 53.07; 56.3% female, 87.0% white) who were eligible for the free seasonal influenza vaccination in the UK. RESULTS: 59.7% of our sample indicated they were likely to have the seasonal influenza vaccination, 22.1% reported being unlikely to have the vaccination and 18.2% were unsure. We used logistic regression to investigate variables associated with intention to receive a seasonal influenza vaccine in the 2020C2021 season.

Today more than ever, urban and transport policies, constrained by social distancing measures and travel restrictions, must be conceptualized and implemented with a particular emphasis on sustainable walkability. Most of the walkability models apply observation and subjective methods to measure walkability, whereas few studies address walkability based on sense perception. To fill this gap, we aim at investigating the perceived neighbourhood walkability (PNW) based on sense perception in a neighbourhood of Brussels. We designed a survey that integrates 22 items grouped into 5 dimensions (cleanness, visual aesthetics, landscape and nature, feeling of pressure, feeling of safety), as well as the socio-demographic attributes of the participants. Using various statistical methods, we show that socio-demographics have almost no effects on perceived neighbourhood walkability. Nonetheless, we found significant differences between groups of different educational backgrounds. Furthermore, using a binomial regression model, we found strong associations between PNW and at least one item from each grouping dimension. Finally, we show that based on a deep neural network for classification, the items have good predictive capabilities (78% of classification accuracy). These findings can help integrate sense perception into objective measurement methods of walkable environments.

Here, we optimized our CLL-1 CAR for anti-leukemic activity in mouse xenograft models of aggressive AML. METHODS: First, we optimized the CLL-1 CAR using different spacer, transmembrane and costimulatory sequences. We used a second retroviral vector to coexpress transgenic IL15. We measured the effects of each construct on T cell phenotype and sequential (recursive) co culture assays with tumor cell targets to determine the durability of the anti tumor activity by flow cytometry. We administered CAR T cells to mice engrafted with patient derived xenografts (PDX) and AML cell line and determined anti tumor activity by bioluminescence imaging and weekly bleeding, measured serum cytokines by multiplex analysis. After euthanasia, we examined formalin-fixed/paraffin embedded sections. Unpaired two-tailed Students t-tests were used and values of p<0.05 were considered significant. Survival was calculated using Mantel-Cox log-rank test. RESULTS: In vitro, CLL-1 CAR T cells with interleukin-15 (IL15) were less terminally differentiated (p<0.0001) and had superior expansion compared with CD28z-CD8 CAR T cells without IL15 (p<0.001). In both AML PDX and AML cell line animal models, CLL-1 CAR T coexpressing transgenic IL15 initially expanded better than CD28z-CD8 CAR T without IL15 (p<0.0001), but produced severe acute toxicity associated with high level production of human tumor necrosis factor  (TNF), IL15 and IL2. Histopathology showed marked inflammatory changes with tissue damage in lung and liver. This acute toxicity could be managed by two strategies, individually or in combination. The excessive TNF alpha secretion could be blocked with anti-TNF alpha antibody, while excessive T cell expansion could be arrested by activation of an inducible caspase nine safety switch by administration of dimerizing drug. Both strategies successfully prolonged tumor-free survival. CONCLUSION: Combinatorial treatment with a TNF blocking antibody and subsequent activation of the caspase-9 control switch increased the expansion, survival and antileukemic potency of CLL-1 CAR T-cells expressing transgenic IL15 while avoiding the toxicities associated with excessive cytokine production and long-term accumulation of activated T-cells.","output":"Modulating TNF activity allows transgenic IL15-Expressing CLL-1 CAR T cells to safely eliminate acute myeloid leukemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Country reports to WHO show low TB preventive treatment (TPT) coverage in contacts of people with TB, below global targets.

In our study, we collected five datasets of miRNAs that were predicted to interact with the genome of SARS-CoV-2. The targets of these miRNAs in the five groups were consistently enriched immune-related pathways and virus-infectious diseases. Interestingly, the five datasets shared no one miRNA but their targets shared 168 genes. The signaling pathway enrichment of 168 shared targets implied an unbalanced immune response that the most of interleukin signaling pathways and none of the interferon signaling pathways were significantly different. ProteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network using the shared targets showed that PPI pairs, including IL6-IL6R, were related to the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis. In addition, we found that SARS-CoV-2 absorption to host miRNA could benefit two popular mutant strains for more infectivity and pathogenicity.

Using an fMRI cohort established before the pandemic in Wuhan, Hubei, we found that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the right amygdala with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was negatively correlated with the stress-induced behavior of these volunteers during the COVID-2019 outbreak in Hubei. Furthermore, the self-connection of the right amygdala, inferred using dynamic causal modeling, was negatively correlated with stress-induced behavior in this cohort. A significant correlation between the right amygdala-dmPFC rsFC and self-connection of the right amygdala was found. Additionally, after three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei when the stressor weakened - and in another cohort collected in regions outside Hubei where the individuals experienced a lower level of stress - the relationship between the amygdala-dmPFC rsFC and the stress-induced behavior disappeared. Our findings support that amygdala connectivity is a predisposing neural feature of stress-induced behavior in the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei, suggesting the amygdala connectivity before stress predicts subsequent behavior while facing an emergent and unexpected event.

RACF COVID-19 outbreaks have been characterised by the rapid spread of infection and high rates of severe disease and associated mortality. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, current infection control measures in RACF including hand hygiene, social distancing, and sterilisation of surfaces, focus on contact and droplet transmission. Germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) light has been used widely to prevent airborne pathogen transmission. Our aim is to investigate the efficacy of GUV technology in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in RACF. METHODS: A multicentre, two-arm double-crossover, randomised controlled trial will be conducted to determine the efficacy of GUV devices to reduce respiratory viral transmission in RACF, as an adjunct to existing infection control measures. The study will be conducted in partnership with three aged care providers in metropolitan and regional South Australia. RACF will be separated into paired within-site zones, then randomised to intervention order (GUV or control). The initial 6-week period will be followed by a 2-week washout before crossover to the second 6-week period. After accounting for estimated within-zone and within-facility correlations of infection, and baseline infection rates (10 per 100 person-days), a sample size of n = 8 zones (n = 40 residents/zone) will provide 89% power to detect a 50% reduction in symptomatic infection rate. The primary outcome will be the incidence rate ratio of combined symptomatic respiratory infections for intervention versus control. Secondary outcomes include incidence rates of hospitalisation for complications associated with respiratory infection; respiratory virus detection in facility air and fomite samples; rates of laboratory confirmed respiratory illnesses and genomic characteristics. DISCUSSION: Measures that can be deployed rapidly into RACF, that avoid the requirement for changes in resident and staff behaviour, and that are effective in reducing the risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission, would provide considerable benefit in safeguarding a highly vulnerable population. In addition, such measures might substantially reduce rates of other respiratory viruses, which contribute considerably to resident morbidity and mortality.

However, primary health-care systems are weak in many low- and middle-income countries and often fail to provide comprehensive, people-centred, integrated care. We analysed the primary health-care systems in 20 low- and middle-income countries using a semi-grounded approach. Options for strengthening primary health-care systems were identified by thematic content analysis. We found that: (i) despite the growing burden of noncommunicable disease, many low- and middle-income countries lacked funds for preventive services; (ii) community health workers were often under-resourced, poorly supported and lacked training; (iii) out-of-pocket expenditure exceeded 40% of total health expenditure in half the countries studied, which affected equity; and (iv) health insurance schemes were hampered by the fragmentation of public and private systems, underfunding, corruption and poor engagement of informal workers. In 14 countries, the private sector was largely unregulated. Moreover, community engagement in primary health care was weak in countries where services were largely privatized. In some countries, decentralization led to the fragmentation of primary health care. Performance improved when financial incentives were linked to regulation and quality improvement, and community involvement was strong. Policy-making should be supported by adequate resources for primary health-care implementation and government spending on primary health care should be increased by at least 1% of gross domestic product. Devising equity-enhancing financing schemes and improving the accountability of primary health-care management is also needed. Support from primary health-care systems is critical for progress towards UHC in the decade to 2030.","output":"Measures to strengthen primary health-care systems in low- and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 was reported in hospitalized patients previously. But the information about cardiac consequences of COVID-19 after recovery is limited. The aim of the study was comprehensive echocardiography assessment of right ventricular (RV) in patients recovered from COVID-19. This is a prospective, single-center study. After recovery from COVID-19, echocardiography was performed in consecutive 79 patients that attended follow-up visits from July 15 to November 30, 2020. According to the recovery at home vs hospital, patients were divided into two groups: home recovery (n = 43) and hospital recovery (n = 36). Comparisons were made with age, sex and risk factor-matched control group (n = 41). In addition to conventional echocardiography parameters, RV global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) and RV free wall strain (RV-FWS) were determined using 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D STE). Of the 79 patients recovered from COVID-19, 43 (55%) recovered at home, while 36 (45%) required hospitalization. The median follow-up duration was 133  35 (87-184) days. In patients recovered from hospital, RV-GLS and RV-FWS were impaired compared to control group (RV-GLS: -17.3  6.8 vs. -20.4  4.9, respectively [p = 0.042]; RV-FWS: -19.0  8.2 vs. -23.4  6.2, respectively [p = 0.022]).

Nsp1 is a 180 amino acid long protein with a primarily flexible structure that allows nsp1 to interact with various cellular factors during host shutoff to inhibit translation and promote mRNA decay. HYPOTHESIS/GOAL OF STUDY: Mutations of the surface residues of nsp1 either attenuate or augment its host shutoff function prompting the hypothesis that these residues bind cellular proteins that facilitate nsp1 during the host shutoff. To identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1 and assist its function, we isolated host proteins proximal to nsp1 in human epithelial kidney cells by using a fusion protein, nsp1\\\\BioID2. These isolated proteins are identified using mass spectroscopy and verified by western blot. Also, we are using computer\\\\based modeling to predict the binding sites of these nsp1\\\\interacting proteins. METHODS AND RESULTS: By comparing protein complexes, we identified a large group of proteins including ribosomal proteins that are likely involved in host shutoff. In addition to the ribosomal proteins, factors implicated in the stress granule formation and RNA processing are identified and verified. We have tested these interactions in multiple mutants that are known to affect the host shutoff activity of nsp1. Surprisingly, none of the mutations in the structured region of nsp1 disrupts any of these mutations.

This is the first trans-national study exploring the qualitative experiences and challenges of using social media while in lockdown or shelter-in-place during the current pandemic. Methods: This study was part of a wider cross-sectional online survey conducted in Norway, the UK, USA and Australia during April/May 2020. The manuscript reports on the qualitative free-text component of the study asking about the challenges of social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, USA and Australia. A total of 1991 responses were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted independently by two researchers. Results: Three overarching themes identified were: Emotional/Mental Health, Information and Being Connected. Participants experienced that using social media during the pandemic amplified anxiety, depression, fear, panic, anger, frustration and loneliness. They felt that there was information overload and social media was full of misleading or polarized opinions which were difficult to switch off. Nonetheless, participants also thought that there was an urge for connection and learning, which was positive and stressful at the same time. Conclusion: Using social media while in a shelter-in-place or lockdown could have a negative impact on the emotional and mental health of some of the population. To support policy and practice in strengthening mental health care in the community, social media could be used to deliver practical advice on coping and stress management.

Frequent ED users were patients with four or more ED visits per year. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of frequent ED use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequent ED users had shorter hospital stays in the ED during the pandemic. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and other covariates, patients with a triage status of level 4-5, pneumonia diagnosis, giddiness, or dyspnea were more likely frequent ED visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aims to determine factors associated with colorectal cancer screening using iFOBT among the average-risk Malaysian population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at five government-run health clinics in the state of Selangor. Adults with an average risk of colorectal cancer (age > 50 years, asymptomatic, and no family history of colorectal cancer) were recruited using systematic random sampling. An interviewer-administered questionnaire adapted from the Cancer Awareness Measure and Health Belief Model was used. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 61 years (interquartile range, 56 to 66). Almost 60% of participants indicated their willingness to be screened. However, only 7.5% had undergone iFOBT. Good knowledge of risk factors of colorectal cancer, perceived susceptibility to the disease, and the doctor's recommendation were associated with increased willingness to be screened: adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.66 (95% CI, 1.12 to 2.46); aOR, 1.70 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.70); and aOR, 5.76 (95% CI, 2.13 to 15.57), respectively.

Multivariable analysis within the average-risk individuals who were willing to be screened for colorectal cancer showed that the doctors recommendations remained as an important cue for positive action, whereas negative perception toward the test was a significant barrier to the actual uptake of iFOBT.

Neither vaccines nor therapeutic drugs are currently available for this novel coronavirus. All measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are thus based on reducing contact between infected and susceptible individuals. Most of these measures such as quarantine and self-isolation require voluntary compliance by the population. However, humans may act in their (perceived) self-interest only. We construct a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission with quarantine and hospitalization coupled with a dynamic game model of adaptive human behavior. Susceptible and infected individuals adopt various behavioral strategies based on perceived prevalence and burden of the disease and sensitivity to isolation measures, and they evolve their strategies using a social learning algorithm (imitation dynamics). This results in complex interplay between the epidemiological model, which affects success of different strategies, and the game-theoretic behavioral model, which in turn affects the spread of the disease. We found that the second wave of the pandemic, which has been observed in the US, can be attributed to rational behavior of susceptible individuals, and that multiple waves of the pandemic are possible if the rate of social learning of infected individuals is sufficiently high. To reduce the burden of the disease on the society, it is necessary to incentivize such altruistic behavior by infected individuals as voluntary self-isolation.","output":"To isolate or not to isolate: The impact of changing behavior on COVID-19 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In June 2019, a migrant camsituated on the Greek island of Samos, originally designed for 650 people, was home to over 5000 people, many of whom w","output":"Conditions in Samos Refugee Camin Greece Severely Below Internationally-Recognised Minimum Humanitarian Standards and Those Outlined by the European Union: A Cross Sectional Health Needs Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Fibrocollagen-covered polyester meshes can be used as possible substitutions for tracheal segments if they become integrated into the tissue without complications.

Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein, Creatine PhosphoKinase (CPK), muscle density, and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) were measured. RESULTS: Participants in the highest tertile of IMAT/muscle had the shorter 28-day survival from ICU admission as compared to subjects in the first tertile. Estimates derived from the Cox proportional hazard models, after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, confirmed the results of the survival analysis (HR 3.94, 95% CI: 1.03C15.09). Participants in the lowest tertile of muscle density had the shorter survival at 28 days from ICU admission as compared to subjects in the highest tertile (HR 3.27, 95% CI: 1.18C4.61), but the relationship was no longer significant when age was included in the model.

PEDV replication is completed and results in a large amount of RNA in the cytoplasm. Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic cytosolic RNA granules formed under various stress conditions including viral infections. Several previous studies suggested that SGs were involved in the antiviral activity of host cells to limit viral propagation. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating the SG response to PEDV infection. SG formation is induced early during PEDV infection, but as infection proceeds, this ability is lost and SGs disappear at late stages of infection (>18 hours post-infection). PEDV infection resulted in the cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) mediated by caspase-8. Using mutational analysis, the PEDV-induced cleavage site within G3BP1 was identified, which differed from the 3C protease cleavage site previously identified. Furthermore, G3BP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D168 and D169 was confirmed in vitro as well as in vivo The overexpression of cleavage-resistant G3BP1 conferred persistent SG formation and suppression of viral replication. Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous G3BP1 abolished SG formation and potentiated viral replication. Taken together, these data provide new insights into novel strategies in which PEDV limits the host stress response and antiviral responses, and indicate that caspase-8-mediated G3BP1 cleavage is important in the failure of host defense against PEDV infection.Importance: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are drawing extensive attention again since the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019.

Overall, the study provides new insight into how Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) impaired SG assembly by targeting G3BP1 via the host proteinase caspase-8. These findings enhanced the understanding of PEDV infection and might help identify new antiviral targets that could inhibit viral replication and limit the pathogenesis of PEDV.","output":"Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection Induces Caspase-8 mediated G3BP1 Cleavage and Subverts Stress Granules to Promote Viral Replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wound healing occurred with serial coordinated processes via coagulation-fibrinolysis, inflammation following to immune-activation, angiogenesis, granulation, and the final re-epithelization. Since the dermis forms critical physical and biological barriers, the repair system should be rapidly and accurately functioned to keep homeostasis in our body. The wound healing is impaired or dysregulated via an inappropriate microenvironment, which is easy to lead to several diseases, including fibrosis in multiple organs and psoriasis. Such a disease led to the dysregulation of several types of cells: immune cells, fibroblasts, mural cells, and endothelial cells. Moreover, recent progress in medical studies uncovers the significant concept. The calcium signaling, typically the following calcineurin-NFAT signaling, essentially regulates not only immune cell activations, but also various healing steps via coagulation, inflammation, and angiogenesis. In this review, we summarize the role of the NFAT activation pathway in wound healing and discuss its overall impact on future therapeutic ways.","output":"Calcineurin-nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT) signaling in pathophysiology of wound healing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Some maternal characteristics indicate worse prognosis in pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

Two mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) activities involved in the formation of the cap, the (guanine-N7)- and the (nucleoside-2'O)-MTases (2'O-MTase), reside in a single domain of non-structural protein NS5 (NS5MTase). This study reports on the biochemical characterization of the 2'O-MTase activity of NS5MTase of dengue virus (NS5MTase(DV)) using purified, short, capped RNA substrates ((7Me)GpppAC(n) or GpppAC(n)). NS5MTase(DV) methylated both types of substrate exclusively at the 2'O position. The efficiency of 2'O-methylation did not depend on the methylation of the N7 position. Using (7Me)GpppAC(n) and GpppAC(n) substrates of increasing chain lengths, it was found that both NS5MTase(DV) 2'O activity and substrate binding increased before reaching a plateau at n=5. Thus, the cap and 6 nt might define the interface providing efficient binding of enzyme and substrate. K(m) values for (7Me)GpppAC(5) and the co-substrate S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) were determined (0.39 and 3.26 microM, respectively). As reported for other AdoMet-dependent RNA and DNA MTases, the 2'O-MTase activity of NS5MTase(DV) showed a low turnover of 3.25x10(-4) s(-1).

Methods- We used data from PROSCIS-B (Prospective Cohort With Incident Stroke Berlin). Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental-State-Examination at baseline, and Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified after 1 to 3 years of follow-up. Patients were categorized according to hs-cTnT quartiles. We performed generalized linear regression to calculate risk ratios of cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental-State-Examination<27; Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified <32). Association of hs-cTnT with cognitive function over time was estimated using a linear mixed model. Results- We included 555 patients (mean age, 67 years, 62% male, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 2 [interquartile range, 1-5], hs-cTnT above upper reference limit 40%, baseline cognitive impairment 28%). Baseline Mini-Mental-State-Examination score and rate of cognitive impairment were lower in patients in the highest versus lowest hs-cTnT quartile (median Mini-Mental-State-Examination 27 versus 29, and 15.3% versus 43.0%, adjusted risk ratio, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.07-2.90], respectively). If anything, cognition seemed to improve in all groups, yet Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified scores were consistently lower in patients within the highest versus lowest hs-cTnT quartile (adjusted , -1.33 [95% CI, -2.65 to -0.02]), without difference in the rate of change over time.

In the absence of reliable vital events registration, we tried to reconstruct the evolution of Yemen's population between June 2014 and September 2021, at subdistrict (administrative level 3) resolution, while accounting for growth and internal migration. Methods We reconstructed subdistrict-month populations starting from June 2014 WorldPop gridded estimates, as a function of assumed birth and death rates, estimated changes in population density, net internal displacement to and from the subdistrict and assumed overlap between internal displacement and WorldPop trends. Available displacement data from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) project were subjected to extensive cleaning and imputation to resolve missingness, including through machine learning models informed by predictors such as insecurity. We also modelled the evolution of displaced groups before and after assessment points. To represent parameter uncertainty, we complemented the main analysis with sensitivity scenarios. Results We estimated that Yemen's population rose from about 26.3M to 31.1M during the seven-year analysis period, with considerable pattern differences at sub-national level. We found that some 10 to 14M Yemenis may have been internally displaced during 2015-2016, about five times United Nations estimates. By contrast, we estimated that the internally displaced population had declined to 1-2M by September 2021. Conclusions This analysis illustrates approaches to analysing the dynamics of displacement, and the application of different models and data streams to supplement incomplete ground observations. Our findings are subject to limitations related to data quality, model inaccuracy and omission of migration outside Yemen. We recommend adaptations to the DTM project to enable more robust estimation.","output":"Reconstructing subdistrict-level population denominators in Yemen after six years of armed conflict and forced displacement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Pioneering empirical studies show that people bereaved due to COVID-19 experience elevated acute grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptom levels, which relate to functional impairment. However, studies focused on Western samples and multivariate analyses of relations between potential risk factors and mental health in this population are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To assess the mental health of Chinese adults bereaved due to COVID-19. To elucidate the associations of demographic and loss-related characteristics with mental health after COVID-19 bereavement. METHODS: Four hundred twenty-two Chinese adults (56% male; Mean age: 32.73 years) recently bereaved due to COVID-19 completed an online survey. Demographic and loss-related characteristics and prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were assessed. RESULTS: Clinically relevant prolonged grief (49%, na?=a?207), posttraumatic stress (22%, na?=a?92), depressive (70%; na?=a?294), and anxiety symptoms (65%; na?=a?272) were reported by a substantial group of participants. In four multiple regressions predicting each mental health indicator, Fs(15,406)a?=a?5.08-7.74, Ps < 0.001, loss-characteristics (i.e., a shorter time since loss, ?sa?=a? -.12-.11, loss of a first-degree relative, ?sa?=a? .18-.37) and subjective loss experiences (i.e., feeling traumatized by the loss, ?sa?=a? .13-.18, or a close and/or conflictual relation with the deceased, ?sa?=a? .12-.23) related most consistently to mental health problems. CONCLUSION: Many Chinese adults bereaved due to COVID-19 experience severe mental health problems. The recent loss of first-degree relatives, feeling traumatized by the loss, and having a close and/or conflictual relationship with the deceased may elevate risk for these mental health problems, which could require indicated psychological treatment.","output":"Correlates of Mental Health After COVID-19 Bereavement in Mainland China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IgA is the second most abundant antibody present in circulation and is enriched at mucosal surfaces.

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the risk of new-onset diabetes after COVID-19 through a population follow-up study. METHODS: All COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea from January 20 to June 4, 2020, were matched with national health insurance data and their health screening data, both provided by the National Health Insurance Service of Korea. Controls were selected as the people who received the PCR test for COVID-19 and showed negative results in the same period and followed up until July 19, 2020. We selected the outcome as the diagnosis of diabetes according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10, E10 C E14). People who were diagnosed with diabetes in the past five years were excluded from both groups. After performing a log-rank test between groups, adjusted incidence rate and hazard ratio were estimated using Cox proportional hazard modeling. Demographic characteristics (age, sex, region, family histories of hypertension/diabetes, and income) and underlying health conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and BMI were adjusted. Proportional assumptions were tested by the zph test and the sensitivity analysis by excluding each factor in turn and comparing results. RESULTS: A total of 6,247 COVID-19 patients and 143,594 controls without diabetes in the past were included for the analysis. The number of new-onset diabetes were 759 (12.15%) in COVID-19 patients and 3,465 (2.41%) in controls (P < 0.01). The adjusted incidence of diabetes was 15.34 (95% confidence interval, CI: 14.10 C 16.66) and 11.18 (95% CI: 10.67 C 11.72) per 100 person-year, respectively, with the mean follow-up time as 46.31 (standard deviation: 16.37) days. The adjusted hazard ratio of diabetes in COVID-19 cases was 2.97 (95% CI: 2.44 C 3.63). CONCLUSION: Since COVID-19 patients showed a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes in a short-time follow-up, we should consider diabetes as one of the possible complications of COVID-19.

With the growth of infection rate, many countries adopted different policies to control the spread of the disease. The UK implemented strict rules instructing individuals to stay at home except in some special circumstances starting from 23 March 2020. Accordingly, this study focuses on sensitivity analysis of transmissibility of the infection as the effects of removing restrictions, for example by returning different occupational groups to their normal working environment and its effect on the reproduction number in the UK. For this reason, available social contact matrices are adopted for the population of UK to account for the average number of contacts. Different scenarios are then considered to analyse the variability of total contacts on the reproduction number in the UK as a whole and each of its four nations. Our data-driven retrospective analysis shows that if more than 38.5% of UK working-age population return to their normal working environment, the reproduction number in the UK is expected to be higher than 1. However, analysis of each nation, separately, shows that local reproduction number in each nation may be different and requires more adequate analysis. Accordingly, we believe that using statistical methods and historical data can provide good estimation of local transmissibility and reproduction number in any region. As a consequence of this analysis, efforts to reduce the restrictions should be implemented locally via different control policies. It is important that these policies consider the social contacts, population density, and the occupational groups that are specific to each region.","output":"Sensitivity analysis of the infection transmissibility in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Few phytoremediation studies have been conducted under semi-arid conditions where plants are subjected to drought and/or salinity stress.

Root, leaf and stem productivity was significantly reduced in the Adom ecotype, suggesting that Darom and Mea Shearim are the more salt-tolerant of the three ecotypes. Net assimilation and stomatal conductance rates in salt-treated Adom were significantly reduced by the last week of the trial, coinciding with reduced intrinsic water use efficiency and chlorophyll a content and greater stomatal aperture. In contrast, early reductions in stomatal conductance and stomatal aperture in Darom and Mea Shearim stabilized, together with pigment concentrations, especially carotenoids.

Most of coronavirus types which attract human (possible for SARS-CoV-2) are often inactivated rapidly in water (i.e., the survival of human coronavirus 229E in water being seven days at 23 C). However, the survival period of coronavirus in water and wastewater strongly depends on temperature, kinds of wastewater, concentration of suspended solids and organic matter, solution pH, and the dose of disinfectant used. The World Health Organization has claimed that the current disinfection process of drinking water could effectively inactivate most of the bacterial and viral communities present in water, especially SARS-CoV-2 (more sensitive to disinfectant like free chlorine). A recent study confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in inflow wastewater (but not detected in outflow one). Although the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in the water influent has been confirmed, an important question is whether it can survive or infect after the disinfection process of drinking water.

To develop precise anticoronavirus drugs and prophylactics, tissue engineering and biomaterial research strategies can serve as a suitable alternative to the conventional treatment options. Therefore, in this Review, we have highlighted various tissue engineering-based diagnostic systems for SARS-CoV-2 and suggested how these strategies involving organ-on-a-chip, organoids, 3D bioprinting, and advanced bioreactor models can be employed to develop in vitro human tissue models, for more efficient diagnosis, drug/vaccine development, and focusing on the need for patient-specific therapy. We believe that combining the basics of virology with tissue engineering techniques can help the researchers to understand the molecular mechanism underlying viral infection, which is critical for effective drug design. In addition, it can also serve to be a suitable platform for drug testing and delivery of small molecules that can lead to therapeutic tools in this dreaded pandemic situation. Additionally, we have also discussed the essential biomaterial properties which polarize the immune system, including dendritic cells and macrophages, toward their inflammatory phenotype, which can thus serve as a reference for exhibiting the role of biomaterial in influencing the adaptive immune response involving B and T lymphocytes to foster a regenerative tissue microenvironment.

DesignCase-crossover study comparing recent (1-14 days after vaccination) with less recent exposure to vaccination among cases of CVT. SettingNational data for Scotland from 1 December 2020, with diagnosed CVT case ascertainment through neuroimaging studies up to 17 May 2021 and diagnostic coding of hospital discharges up to 28 April 2021 and with linkage to vaccination records. Main outcome measurePrimary acute cerebral venous thrombosis ResultsOf 50 primary acute CVT cases, 29 were ascertained only from neuroimaging studies, 2 were ascertained only from hospital discharges, and 19 were ascertained from both sources. Of these 50 cases, 14 had received the Astra-Zeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine and 3 the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. The incidence of CVT per million doses in the first 14 days after vaccination was 2.2 (95% credible interval 0.9 to 4.1) for ChAdOx1 and 1 (95% credible interval 0.1 to 2.9) for BNT162b2. The rate ratio for CVT associated with exposure to ChAdOx1 in the first 14 days compared with exposure 15-84 days after vaccination was 3.2 (95% credible interval 1.1 to 9.5). The 95% credible interval for the rate ratio associated with recent versus less recent exposure to BNT162b2 (0.6 to 95.8) was too wide for useful inference. ConclusionsThese findings support a causal association between CVT and the AstraZeneca vaccine. The absolute risk of post-vaccination CVT in this population-wide study in Scotland was lower than has been reported for populations in Scandinavia and Germany; the explanation for this is not clear. What is already known on this topicThe risk of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) within 28 days of receiving the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine has been estimated as 18 to 25 per million doses in Germany and Scandinavia, but only 5 per million doses in the UK based on the Yellow Card reporting scheme. Risk estimates based on adverse event reporting systems are subject to under-ascertainment and other biases. What this study addsAll diagnosed cases of CVT in Scotland were ascertained by searching neuroimaging studies from December 2020 to May 2021 and linked to national vaccination records. The risk of CVT within 28 days of vaccination with ChAdOx1 was estimated as 3.5 per million doses with an upper bound of 6 per million doses, against a background incidence of about 12 per million adults per year. This indicates that the Yellow Card system has not seriously underestimated the risk in the UK; the explanation for higher risk in other European countries is not clear.","output":"Association of cerebral venous thrombosis with recent COVID-19 vaccination: case-crossover study using ascertainment through neuroimaging in Scotland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Vaccines generally have reduced effectiveness in hemodialysis patients and a similar condition may also apply for the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccines.

In this study, we explored the role of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-related proteins in four types of breast cancer tissues. METHODS Mitochondrial fractions were taken from four breast cancer tissues (luminal A, luminal B, Her2 -overexpression, and TNBC) and the expression of mitochondrial polyubiquitinated proteins was observed by western blot and ELISA. In addition, the expression of hsp10, hsp60, and clpp in mitochondria was observed by western blot in breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues, and confirmed by ELISA. The expression levels of hsp10 and hsp60 were correlated with clinicopathological parameters in 114 breast cancer patients. RESULTS We found an increase in the performance of mitochondrial polyubiquitinated proteins in breast cancer tissues of luminal A, luminal B, Her2-overexpression, and TNBC. The mitochondrial hsp10, hsp60, and clpp are abundantly expressed in breast cancer tissues rather than adjacent noncancerous tissues. The expression levels of mitochondrial hsp10 and hsp60 were highest in histological grade 3 breast cancer tissues. Additionally, mitochondria with high hsp60 expression were more present in Her2-positive tumors. CONCLUSIONS We observed that mtUPR was specifically activated in breast cancer tissues but inactivated in normal mammary tissue.

Contact tracing is a vital strategy in epidemic emergency management; however, traditional contact tracing faces many limitations in practice. The application of digital technology provides an opportunity for local governments to trace the contacts of individuals with COVID-19 more comprehensively, efficiently, and precisely. OBJECTIVE: Our research aimed to provide new solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional contact tracing by introducing the organizational process, technical process, and main achievements of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province. METHODS: A graph database algorithm, which can efficiently process complex relational networks, was applied in Hainan Province; this algorithm relies on a governmental big data platform to analyze multisource COVID-19 epidemic data and build networks of relationships among high-risk infected individuals, the general population, vehicles, and public places to identify and trace contacts. We summarized the organizational and technical process of digital contact tracing in Hainan Province based on interviews and data analyses. RESULTS: An integrated emergency management command system and a multi-agency coordination mechanism were formed during the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hainan Province. The collection, storage, analysis, and application of multisource epidemic data were realized based on the government's big data platform using a centralized model. The graph database algorithm is compatible with this platform and can analyze multisource and heterogeneous big data related to the epidemic. These practices were used to quickly and accurately identify and trace 10,871 contacts among hundreds of thousands of epidemic data records; 378 closest contacts and a number of public places with high risk of infection were identified. A confirmed patient was found after quarantine measures were implemented by all contacts. CONCLUSIONS: During the emergency management of the COVID-19 epidemic, Hainan Province used a graph database algorithm to trace contacts in a centralized model, which can identify infected individuals and high-risk public places more quickly and accurately. This practice can provide support to government agencies to implement precise, agile, and evidence-based emergency management measures and improve the responsiveness of the public health emergency response system. Strengthening data security, improving tracing accuracy, enabling intelligent data collection, and improving data-sharing mechanisms and technologies are directions for optimizing digital contact tracing.","output":"Digital Contact Tracing Based on a Graph Database Algorithm for Emergency Management During the COVID-19 Epidemic: Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Review the present use of 18F-FDG-PET in lung inflammation/interstitial lung diseases. Review thepotential value of 18F-FDG-PET in the global measurement and monitoring of lung inflammation/interstitial lungdiseases. Assess the added prospective value of 18F-FDG-PET imaging in inflammatory diseases involving thelung. Methods: In light of the ongoing SARS-COV-2 pandemic, more attention has been drawn to lung disorders. Medicalimaging can play a major role in disease assessment here, given that early diagnosis of various lung disorders iscrucial. Regarding such diseases, increased glucose uptake in lung parenchyma is a hallmark of severalpathophysiological processes, including inflammation and development of benign/malignant tumors. Major riskfactors for such increased glucose uptake include smoking, environmental irritants, viral infections etc. Numerousstudies have directly shown that global 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) isone of the most sensitive modalities to measure glucose uptake, albeit in other areas of the body like the heart and liver. 18F-FDG-PET is especially effective in early stage measurement, given its inherent property as a method toassess increased metabolic activity in inflammation occurring long before structural changes. As of yet though, littleoriginal research exists in the current literature specifically regarding the utility of 18F-FDG-PET for the assessmentof inflammation in the human lung. We believe that this is an area of high interest, given the reasons listed aboveand the increased emphasis on earlier diagnosis of common lung disorders (thus necessitating the prioritization ofmolecular as compared to structural imaging). Results: Numerous research by our own lab and fellow colleagues has found that 18F-FDG-PET can successfullyquantify tumor growth for various forms of lung cancer, in both human and animal models. Despite this, asmentioned above, no such definitive conclusion can be made about human lung inflammation. The current state ofthe field centers mainly around studying in vivo application of 18F-FDG-PET to animal models, which has beensuccessfully done in both sheep and rat lungs. We believed that this application could extend to the human body,and thus hypothesized that quantifying human lung inflammation through 18F-FDG-PET would show similarpromise. And indeed, our retrospective research (currently in submission) has found that inflammation of the lung,as globally assessed by 18F-FDG-PET, is significantly higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers, while also beingpositively correlated with age. Global assessment of the lung here was key, in order to represent the true extent ofinflammation across the entire lung rather than cherry-picking isolated focal nodules. Conclusions: 18F-FDG-PET can likely play a valuable role in management of lung disorders, especially in novelareas such as lung inflammation. However, the lack of original, prospective data on human models necessitatesfurther research. Specifically, well-powered studies should be conducted to explore in vivo 18F-FDG-PET uptake inlung parenchyma and to compare 18F-FDG-PET sensitivity/specificity with other imaging modalities in the lung.","output":"Potential of 18F-FDG-PET in the global assessment oflung inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modularity - the partitioning of software into units of functionality that interact with each other via interfaces - has been the mainstay of software development for half a century.

Study design WGS was performed with nucleic acids from sputum and nasopharyngeal aspirates from four pediatric patients with known respiratory tract infections (two patients with human rhinovirus, one patient with human metapneumovirus and one patient with respiratory syncytial virus), and from four pediatric patients with PCR-negative RTI, and two control samples. Results Viral infections detected by routine molecular diagnostic methods were confirmed by WGS; in addition, typing information of the different viruses was generated. In three out of four samples from pediatric patients with PCR-negative respiratory tract infections and the two control samples, no causative viral pathogens could be detected. In one sample from a patient with PCR-negative RTI, rhinovirus type-C was detected. Almost complete viral genomes could be assembled and in all cases virus species could be determined.

The primary objective of this study was to clarify temporal changes in Delta-variant SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and detection rates in EBC collected from patients, and to validate the feasibility of Delta-variant SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from EBC for diagnosing COVID-19. The secondary objective was to compare SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads in EBC between Delta-variant and wild-type. Subjects were 41 COVID-19 patients infected with the Delta-variant. EBC samples were collected from subjects on the day of or the day after admission using R-tube? (Respiratory Research, Austin, Texas, USA), as in our previous study.

Based on a review of the totality of available evidence, we recommend that most patients with cancer should receive the recommended dose and schedule of one of the COVID-19 vaccines when available. We encourage industry, regulators and professional research organizations to carefully track the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer in the real world setting and routinely report unanticipated adverse events and signs of loss of efficacy. Particular attention is needed for patients on active cancer therapy to carefully evaluate efficacy and safety in relationship to the timing of vaccination relative to that of active cancer treatment and immunosuppression.","output":"Challenges and Opportunities for COVID-19 Vaccines in Patients with Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scholars in different scientific fields and practitioners are analyzing the rise of production and diffusion of fake news and problematic information that is rapidly contaminating the digital world Although problematic information might seriously affect brands, marketing and consumer behavior research is surprisingly limited This article aims to provide a research agenda for marketing by analyzing the previous literature and identifying relevant insights suggested by different disciplines Based on the review of 86 interdisciplinary scientific papers and 5 managerial reports, we speculate on future avenues for consumer behavior, marketing strategy, and marketing ethics research about fake news and problematic information","output":"Fake news or true lies?

In the setting of the STROKOVID network, a collaborative project between the ten centers designed as hubs for the treatment of acute stroke during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy, we retrospectively compared clinical features and process measures of patients with confirmed infection (COVID-19) and non-infected patients (non-COVID-19) who underwent reperfusion therapies for acute ischemic stroke. Between March 8 and April 30, 2020, 296 consecutive patients [median age, 74 years (interquartile range (IQR), 62C80.75); males, 154 (52.0%); 34 (11.5%) COVID-19] qualified for the analysis. Time from symptoms onset to treatment was longer in the COVID-19 group [230 (IQR 200.5C270) minutes vs. 190 (IQR 150C245) minutes; p = 0.007], especially in the first half of the study period. Patients with COVID-19 who underwent endovascular thrombectomy had more frequently absent collaterals or collaterals filling  50% of the occluded territory (50.0% vs. 16.6%; OR 5.05; 95% CI 1.82C13.80) and a lower rate of good/complete recanalization of the primary arterial occlusive lesion (55.6% vs. 81.0%; OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.10C0.80). Post-procedural intracranial hemorrhages were more frequent (35.3% vs. 19.5%; OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.04C4.83) and outcome was worse among COVID-19 patients (in-hospital death, 38.2% vs. 8.8%; OR 6.43; 95% CI 2.85C14.50). Our findings showed longer delays in the intra-hospital management of acute ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients, especially in the early phase of the outbreak, that likely impacted patients outcome and should be the target of future interventions.

In addition, due to different backgrounds, inadequate caregivers may cause older people to suffer from spiritual alienation under the current system. Most of the existing studies present a centralized architecture, but even if technology elements are incorporated, such as cloud center services or expert systems, it is still impossible to solve the above-mentioned challenges. This study moves past the centralized architecture and attempts to use the decentralized architecture with Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technology to refine the model of providing comprehensive care for older people. Using the proposed mapping mutual clustering algorithm in this study, the positions of caregivers and older people can be changed at any time based on the four main background elements: risk level, physiology, medical record, and demography. In addition, this study uses the proposed long-term care decentralized architecture algorithm to solve the stability of care records with transparency to achieve the effect of continuous tracking. Based on previous records, it can also dynamically change the new matching mode. The main contribution of this research is the proposal of an innovative solution to the problem of mental alienation, insufficient manpower, and the privacy issue. In addition, this study evaluates the proposed method through practical experiments. The corporation features have been offered and evaluated with user perceptions by a one-sample t-test;the proposed algorithm to the research model also has been compared with not putting it into the model through ANOVA analysis to get that all hypotheses are supported. The results reveal a high level of accuracy of the proposed mutual algorithm forecasting and positive user perceptions from the post-study questionnaire.

METHODS: We retrospectively studied all critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia meeting ICU admission criteria who were admitted to Dubai hospital between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. All the patients who transferred to wards other than designated ICU constitute category as cases. All patients who directly admitted to the designated ICU ward from emergency department constitute controls. The demographics, clinical parameters, and treatment profile of these patients were recorded and compared. Prevalence of secondary bacterial infection was calculated. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 had high prevalence of secondary bacterial infection. Patients who stayed at undesignated ICU wards had higher occurrence of inpatient fever, hypoxemia, and they were more likely to be sedated and paralyzed than patients who stayed in designated ICU wards. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed care outside designated ICU ward does not predict increase in secondary nonviral microbial infections.

This study, therefore, sought to describe the experiences and perceptions of diploma nursing students and post-registration nurses regarding the teaching and learning of clinical competence in Ghana.

Fifty-five (55) participants, comprising 40 students and 15 post-registration diploma nurses, from six research sites were recruited into focus group discussions (FGDs) using a maximum variation purposive sampling technique. A thematic framework method was used to analyze the data with the aid of ATLAS.ti software. Three themes emerged from the focus group discussions: nursing education institutional factors; clinical placement design, implementation, and system challenges; challenges of clinical teaching and learning. We conclude that the current approach to clinical nursing education, such as the overreliance on clinical placement and the use of more teacher-centered teaching approaches, are ineffective in facilitating the development of clinical competence.

The main application of these peptidyl -fluorinated ketones in medicinal chemistry relies in their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit serine and cysteine proteases. These compounds can be used as probes to study the proteolytic activity of the aforementioned proteases and to elucidate their role in the insurgence and progress on several diseases. Likewise, if the fluorinated methyl ketone moiety is suitably connected to a peptidic backbone, it may confer to the resulting structure an excellent substrate peculiarity and the possibility of being recognized by a specific subclass of human or pathogenic proteases.

Materials and methods. The work was carried out according to the program for assessing population immunity to SARS -CoV-2 of the population of the Russian Federation according to the methodology developed by the Rospotrebnadzor with the participation of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute. The selection of participants was carried out by a questionnaire method using cloud technologies. The volunteers were randomized by age by stratification into 7 age groups: 1C17, 18C29, 30C39, 40C49, 50C59, 60C69, 70+ years old. Territorial randomization consisted in limiting the engaging of volunteers C no more than 30 people from one enterprise. After the initialcross-sectionalstudy, a 3-stage seromonitoring was carried out, in which the same volunteers participated. Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid were determined in peripheral blood serum by the enzyme immunoassay using an appropriate set of reagents produced by the State Scientific Center for Medical and Biological Sciences of the Rospotrebnadzor (Obolensk). Statistical analysis was performed using the Excel package. The confidence interval for the proportion was calculated using the A. Wald, J. Wolfowitz method with A. Agresti, B.A. Coulls correction. The statistical significance of the differences was calculated online using a specialized calculator. The statistical significance of the differences was assessed with a probability of p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. In a comparative analysis, the highest morbidity was observed in the Khabarovsk Territory, the lowest C in the Primorsky Territory. The level of seroprevalence among the population of the region was 19.6 % (95 % CI: 18.2C21.1) in the Khabarovsk Territory, 19.6 % (95 % CI: 18.1C21.2) in the Primorsky Territory19,6 % and 45,5 % (95 % CI: 43.7C47.3) in the Amur region. The highest seroprevalence was noted among 1C17 years old children, mainly due to the subgroup of 14C17-years-olds. The smallest proportion of seropositive was found among 40C49-year-olds in the Khabarovsk Territory (14.7 %, 95 % CI: 11.2C18.6), 18C28-year-olds in the Primorsky Territory (13.3 %, 95 % CI: 10.0C17.1) and 30C39-year-olds in the Amur Region (36.3 %, 95% CI: 31.7C41.6). No statistically significant dependence of seroprevalence on territorial and occupational factors has been established, with the exception of an increase in the proportion of seropositive medical workers in Primorsky Territory. In the process of 3-stage seromonitoring, a regular increase in the proportion of seropositive people was revealed in all SRFE. The resulting tendency is correctly describedby a second-order polynomial. Arelationship was revealed between the number of convalescents and persons in contact with them, which made it possible to calculate the base reproductive number (R0) in the range from 1.4 (Primorsky Territory) to 2.4 (Amur Region). Analysis of seroprevalent volunteers showed that the number of asymptomatic individuals varied from 94.1 % (95 % CI: 92.8C95.3) to 98.3 % (95 % CI: 98.8C99.2). This indicates that most of the volunteers had COVID-19 asymptomatically. Conclusions. A comparative study showed the prevalence of seroprevalence in the Amur Region compared with the Khabarovsk and Primorsky Territories. The relationship between the number of convalescents and persons in contact with them was noted. The value of the base R0 is calculated. It has been shown that more than 90 % of seropositive individuals in the COVID-10 SRFE were asymptomatic. ? 2021 Scientific Centre for Family Health and Human Reproduction Problems.

Disease transmission patterns are dynamic, non-linear, and spatially complex. This anisotropic characteristic of disease spread necessitates the ideal solution to be sensitive to the geographic context. A Spatial Diffusion Model (SDM) to predict interaction potential and COVID-19 risk probability is developed by adapting the Newtonian gravity model. This novel approach overcomes the limitations of existing epidemiological studies by characterizing the behavioral patterns of the infected population to model the spatiotemporal transmission of disease across the geographic space. The proposed model is robust as it couples a multicriteria behavioral pattern to enhance predictive capability. The model shows an 83.74% correlation with the observational COVID-19 case data. The highest risk patterns for COVID-19 are predicted in the neighborhoods of New York City (NYC), exhibiting clustered socioeconomic disparities along with racial and ethnic heterogeneity. Policymakers can use these results to identify neighborhoods at high risk for becoming hot spots;efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions.

In this study, we identified peptide epitopes associated with SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity. Using immunoinformatic methods, T-cell epitopes from spike, membrane, and envelope were selected for maximal HLA-binding potential, coverage of HLA diversity, coverage of circulating virus, and minimal potential cross-reactivity with self. Direct restimulation of PBMCs collected from SARS-CoV-2 convalescents confirmed 66% of predicted epitopes, whereas only 9% were confirmed in naive individuals. However, following a brief period of epitope-specific T-cell expansion, both cohorts demonstrated robust T-cell responses to 97% of epitopes. HLA-DR3 transgenic mouse immunization with peptides co-formulated with poly-ICLC generated a potent Th1-skewed, epitope-specific memory response, alleviating safety concerns of enhanced respiratory disease associated with Th2 induction.

Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods: In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings: We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation: COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low. The COVID-19 epidemic should be controllable with appropriate interventions (suspension of public transportation, cancellation of mass gatherings, implementation of surveillance and testing, and promotion of personal hygiene and face mask use).","output":"Strongly Heterogeneous Transmission of COVID-19 in Mainland China: Local and Regional Variation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to quantify the financial impact of COVID-19 on radiology departments, and to describe the structure of both volume and revenue recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiology studies from a large academic health system were retrospectively studied from the first 33 weeks of 2020. Volume and work relative value unit (wRVU) data were aggregated on a weekly basis for three periods: Presurge (weeks 1-9), surge (10-19), and recovery (20-33), and analyzed compared to the pre-COVID baseline stratified by modality, specialty, patient service location, and facility type. Mean and median wRVU per study were used as a surrogate for case complexity. RESULTS: During the pandemic surge, case volumes fell 57%, while wRVUs fell by 69% relative to the pre-COVID-19 baseline. Mean wRVU per study was 1.13 in the presurge period, 1.03 during the surge, and 1.19 in the recovery. Categories with the greatest mean complexity declines were radiography (-14.7%), cardiothoracic imaging (-16.2%), and community hospitals overall (-15.9%). Breast imaging (+6.5%), interventional (+5.5%), and outpatient (+12.1%) complexity increased. During the recovery, significant increases in complexity were seen in cardiothoracic (0.46 to 0.49), abdominal (1.80 to 1.91), and neuroradiology (2.46 to 2.56) at stand-alone outpatient centers with similar changes at community hospitals. At academic hospitals, only breast imaging complexity remained elevated (1.32 from 1.17) during the recovery. CONCLUSION: Reliance on volume alone underestimates the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as there was a disproportionate loss in high-RVU studies. However, increased complexity of outpatient cases has stabilized overall losses during the recovery.","output":"Sources of Revenue Loss and Recovery in Radiology Practices During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have used glucose oxidate-avidin-biotin (GAB) immunohistochemistry to detect herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 & 2 virion antigen in fixed tissue.

All patients had their first chest computed tomography scan within five days of symptom onset. The dandelion sign was defined by a focal ground glass opacity (GGO) with a central thickening of the airway wall, and the focal crazy paving sign was defined by a focal GGO with thickening of the interlobular septa. RESULTS: Consolidation presented in only 4.9% (5/103) of the mild pneumonia cases, which was significantly lower than that in severe pneumonia cases (70.1% 54/77), p < .001). Multifocal distribution and pure GGOs were observed more frequently in severe cases of pneumonia (p < .05). The dandelion sign was present in 86.4% (89/103) of the mild pneumonia cases, significantly more frequent than those with severe pneumonia (13.0% [10/77], p < .001).

A positive school culture has been associated with positive child and youth development, effective risk prevention and health promotion efforts, with extensive evidence for the impact on student mental health. Interventions which focus on socio-cultural elements of school life, and which involve students actively in the process, are increasingly understood to be important for student mental health promotion. This qualitative study was undertaken in three UK secondary schools prior to the implementation of a participative action research study bringing students and staff together to identify changes to school culture that might impact student mental health. The aim was to identify how school culture is conceptualised by students, parents and staff in three UK secondary schools. A secondary aim was to explore which components of school culture were perceived to be most important for student mental health. METHODS: Across three schools, 27 staff and seven parents participated in in-depth interviews, and 28 students participated in four focus groups. The Framework Method of thematic analysis was applied. RESULTS: Respondents identified elements of school culture that aligned into four dimensions; structure and context, organisational and academic, community, and safety and support. There was strong evidence of the interdependence of the four dimensions in shaping the culture of a school. CONCLUSIONS: School staff who seek to shape and improve school culture as a means of promoting student mental health may have better results if this interdependence is acknowledged, and improvements are addressed across all four dimensions.

At the host level, COVID-19, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), affects the respiratory system, with the clinical symptoms ranging from mild to severe or critical illness that often requires hospitalization and oxygen support. There is no specific therapy for COVID-19, as is the case for any common viral disease except drugs to reduce the viral load and alleviate the inflammatory symptoms. Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), also primarily affects the lungs and has clinical signs similar to pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Active TB is a leading killer among infectious diseases and adds to the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In immunocompetent individuals, primary Mtb infection can also lead to a non-progressive, asymptomatic latency. However, latent Mtb infection (LTBI) can reactivate symptomatic TB disease upon host immune-suppressing conditions. Importantly, the diagnosis and treatment of TB are hampered and admixed with COVID-19 control measures. The US-Center for Disease Control (US-CDC) recommends using antiviral drugs, Remdesivir or corticosteroid (CST), such as dexamethasone either alone or in-combination with specific recommendations for COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization or oxygen support. However, CSTs can cause immunosuppression, besides their anti-inflammatory properties. The altered host immunity during COVID-19, combined with CST therapy, poses a significant risk for new secondary infections and/or reactivation of existing quiescent infections, such as LTBI. This review highlights CST therapy recommendations for COVID-19, various types and mechanisms of action of CSTs, the deadly combination of two respiratory infectious diseases COVID-19 and TB. It also discusses the importance of screening for LTBI to prevent TB reactivation during corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19.","output":"Corticosteroids for COVID-19 Therapy: Potential Implications on Tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper aims to critically review past and emerging literature to help professionals and researchers alike to better understand, manage and valorize both the tourism impacts and transformational affordance of COVID-19.

Here we describe the method and results of our technique of IOES in the supine position during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) using a guide wire cannulation (intraoperative supine endoscopic sphincterotomy by endoscopist-controlled guide wire cannulation) [ISEEG] technique). PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of the outcome for 36 patients undergoing LC with IOES (ISEEG technique) for acute biliary colic and jaundice with suspicion of choledocholithiasis. RESULTS On confirmation of CBD stones by intraoperative cholangiogram, CBD catheterization was successful in 34/36 (94.44%) patients with successful stone clearance in all of them by the ISEEG technique demonstrating 100% efficacy for stone clearance; the remaining 2 patients needed conversion to open surgery. The median time for the ISEEG technique during intraoperative sphincterotomy was 9 minutes (range, 7-23 minutes). Average hospital stay was 4.8 days (range, 2-15 days). At the 1-month follow-up, all patients were biliary symptom-free. Three of 36 patients (8.33%) had mild postoperative pancreatitis. There was no procedure-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS LC coupled with the ISEEG technique performed by an expert endoscopist is an effective single-stage minimally invasive treatment for CBD stones with good efficacy, good stone clearance rates, and low morbidity.","output":"Intraoperative endoscopist-controlled guide wire cannulation technique sphincterotomy during laparoscopic cholecystectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, most attention has focused on containing transmission and addressing the surge of critically ill patients in acute care settings As we enter the second phase of the pandemic, emphasis must evolve to post-acute care of COVID-19 survivors Persisting cardiorespiratory symptoms have been reported at several months after the onset of the infection Information is lacking on the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance after COVID-19 Previous outbreaks of coronaviruses have been associated with persistent dyspnea, muscle weakness, fatigue and reduced quality of life The extent of Covid-19 sequelae remains to be evaluated, but persisting cardiorespiratory symptoms in COVID-19 survivors can be described as two distinct entities The first type of post-Covid symptoms are directly related to organ injury in the acute phase, or the complications of treatment The second type of persisting symptoms can affect patients even with mild initial disease presentation without evidence of organ damage The mechanisms are still poorly qualified to date There is a lack of correlation between initial symptom severity and residual symptoms at exertion We report exercise hyperventilation as a major limiting factor in COVID-19 survivors The origin of this hyperventilation may be related to an abnormality of ventilatory control, by either hyperactivity of activator systems (automatic and cortical ventilatory control, peripheral afferents, and sensory cortex) or failure of inhibitory systems (endorphins) in the aftermath of pulmonary infection Hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia can cause a multitude of extremely disabling symptoms such as dyspnea, tachycardia, chest pain, fatigue, dizziness and syncope at exertion","output":"Hyperventilation: A Possible Explanation for Long-Lasting Exercise Intolerance in Mild COVID-19 Survivors?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: During this ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), procalcitonin (PCT) assay has proven to be a useful tool in assisting clinicians to diagnose bacterial superinfection. However, in the absence of signs of infection or at resolution thereof, inappropriately and persistently high PCT may suggest and reveal the presence of other pathologies. We report a patient with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia in whom persistence of initially elevated PCT during recovery prompted the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Case report: A 43- year-old man presented with a two-day history of fever, sneezing, sore throat and dry cough. Physical exam revealed decreased sounds and coarse crackles in both lung bases at auscultation. Medical history was positive for cognitive impairment since birth, arterial hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis. Initial studies included mild lymphocytopenia 650/l (760 - 5000), D-Dimer 0.73 g/ml (< 0.5), C reactive protein (CRP) of 62 mg/l (< 5) and PCT of 94 ng/ml (0.00 - 0.10). Positivity for SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected and chest computerized tomography showed bilateral ground-glass opacities in the basilar lung zones and hyperdense and irregular foci in the thoracic vertebral bodies. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started and was maintained for seven days but, despite clinical improvement and the normalization of CRP, serum PCT was persistently high (84 ng/ml). Serum calcitonin (CTN) was 2120 pg/ml (normal up to 12 pg/ml). Neck ultrasound revealed inhomogeneously echogenic lymph nodes with small punctate calcifications and a non-homogeneous thyroid with multiple nodules. Cytological examination by fine needle aspiration and CTN measurement on washing liquid confirmed the suspicion of MTC. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral cervical lymph node dissection. Histological analysis confirmed MTC of right thyroid lobe and metastasis at lymph nodes of the central right midneck area. Blood tests performed 48 hours after surgery showed a lowering of CTN (986 pg/mL) and PCT (16 ng/mL). A 6-months follow up showed persistent increased CTN and PCT levels (921 pg/ml and 16 ng/ml, respectively) while a (18)F-fluorodihydro-xyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET did not reveal any suspicious fixations at thyroid lodge and cervical lymph node stations while multiple osteoblastic foci in the skeletal area were described. A close follow-up was planned with establishment of the results of RET gene analysis. Discussion: Although CTN is the gold standard biochemical parameter for the diagnosis and follow-up of MTC, PCT can be useful as a biochemical marker of MTC suspicion in patients with inflammatory conditions and persistently elevated PCT even after resolution. In the present CASE, high levels of PCT in a patient with Covid-19 pneumonia without signs of bacterial infection, allowed to diagnose MCT. Conclusion: In the absence of any other signs of infection, a complete clinical assessment, including neck palpation, CTN measurement and thyroid ultrasound should be performed in the presence of persistently elevated PCT.","output":"Persistence of Elevated Procalcitonin in a Patient with Covid-19 Uncovering a Diagnosis of Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been sequenced and a possible animal reservoir identified, seroprevalence studies and mass screening for detection of subclinical and non-pneumonic infections are still lacking. METHODS: We cloned and purified the nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV and examined their immunogenicity with serum from patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia. An ELISA based on recombinant nucleocapsid protein for IgG detection was tested with serum from 149 healthy blood donors who donated 3 years previously and with serum positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV (by indirect immunofluorescence assay) from 106 patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV was studied with the ELISA in healthy blood donors who donated during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, non-pneumonic hospital inpatients, and symptom-free health-care workers. All positive samples were confirmed by two separate western-blot assays (with recombinant nucleocapsid protein and recombinant spike polypeptide). FINDINGS: Western-blot analysis showed that the nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV are highly immunogenic. The specificity of the IgG antibody test (ELISA with positive samples confirmed by the two western-blot assays) was 100%, and the sensitivity was 943%.

However, the role of laparoscopy has not been clearly defined specifically in cases after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. This study aimed to assess the impact of preoperative radiotherapy on the feasibility of laparoscopic rectal excision with sphincter preservation for rectal cancer. METHODS From 1999 to 2010, the authors considered all patients treated by laparoscopic rectal excision with sphincter preservation for rectal cancer. Patients treated by long-course preoperative radiochemotherapy (45 Gy during 5 weeks) were compared with those treated by surgery alone. The end points of the study were mortality, conversion, and overall and surgical morbidity. RESULTS Among 422 patients treated by laparoscopic conservative rectal excision, 292 received preoperative radiotherapy, and 130 had surgery alone. The two groups were similar in sex, age, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. The mortality rate was 0.3% in the radiotherapy group and 0.8% in the surgical group (P = 0.52). The two groups did not differ in terms of conversion (19 vs. 15%; P = 0.39), overall morbidity (37 vs. 29%; P = 0.14), surgical morbidity (20 vs. 18%; P = 0.60), or anastomotic leakage (13 vs. 11%; P = 0.54). Multivariate analysis showed male gender and synchronous metastasis as independent factors of surgical morbidity. The independent factors of conversion were male gender, obesity, tumor stage, and type of anastomosis. Preoperative radiotherapy influenced neither conversion nor surgical morbidity.

Currently, there are vaccine candidates in clinical trials and development, so it is only a matter of time before one is authorised for human use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected public opinion survey results about attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination conducted in 2020 in 26 European countries. RESULTS: The pooled surveys were conducted on a total of 24 970 participants; on average only 58% (n=14 365/24 970) of responders across Europe were willing to get a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available, 16% (n=3998/24 970) were neutral, and 26% (n=6607/24 970) were not planning to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. Such a low vaccination response could make it exceedingly difficult to reach the herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. CONCLUSION: It is very important to start conducting educational public health activities on the topic of vaccination as soon as possible, before a vaccine becomes available, in order to improve attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

In addition, a review of the literature was performed to identify the published rates of complications for these procedures. RESULTS During this time period, we have performed 85 LGT using this modified technique. In that same period, there have been 34 PEGs placed. The modification in our technique was instituted after a patient required reoperation for dislodgement in a laparoscopic U-stitch gastrostomy. To date, in the modified LGT group, there have been no disruptions of the gastrostomy tract in either the early or late periods, <90 days or >90 days, respectively. There have been 5 (5.9%) early dislodgements of the gastrostomy tube. All of these were before postoperative day 14 (at postoperative days 1, 2, 6, and 12), and all were replaced with placement verified by contrast study. None required reoperation. In the PEG group, there was 1 (2.9%) early and 1 (2.9%) late dislodgements and tract disruption that required reoperation.

In two studies conducted among individuals in Belgium and the U.S., we therefore examined the relationship between superstitious beliefs, locus of control, and feeling at risk of Covid-19. Across both countries, we found that superstition is positively, and internal locus of control negatively, related with feeling at risk of Covid-19. Moreover, in Belgium, the effect of superstition was less pronounced for individuals with a higher level of internal locus of control. The absence of an interaction effect between superstition and locus of control in the U.S. could be explained by this country's higher level of superstitious beliefs and lower level of internal locus of control combined with a stronger feeling of being at risk of Covid-19 or cultural differences such as Belgium's higher uncertainty avoidance compared to the U.S.","output":"Superstitious beliefs, locus of control, and feeling at risk in the face of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To examine the impact of fascia iliaca blocks performed in the emergency department on hip fracture patients on opioid consumption, length of stay, and readmission rate.

Methods: A prospective study was performed on 300 nasopharyngeal swabs randomly collected from 31 May to 6 July 2021. Nasopharyngeal samples were assayed with DiaSorins LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag and TaqPath? COVID-19 multiplex RT-qPCR. Results: Of 300 participants, 150 had a RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection of whom 113 (75.33%) were also detected by the DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag. Taking RT-qPCR as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of the DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag assay were evaluated as 75.33% (95% CI = 67.64C82) and 100% (95% CI = 97.57C100), respectively. When a viral load cut-off was applied for high viral load (median cycle threshold (Ct) < 18.57), the overall sensitivity was increased to 96.55% (95% CI = 88.09C99.58). Interestingly, median RT-qPCR Ct and SARS-CoV-2 Ag values were similar between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. Conclusions: Automated, quantitative LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag assay shows good performance to identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with moderate to high viral loads. LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag testing could be used as frontline testing for COVID-19 diagnosis and be more suitable for large utilization.","output":"Diagnostic Performance of Automated SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay in Nasal Swab during COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Provision of online and remote specialist education and general continued professional education in medicine is a growing field. For radiology specifically, the ability to access web-based platforms that house high resolution medical images, and the high fidelity of simulated activities is increasingly growing due to positive changes in technology. This study investigates the differences in providing a self-directed specialist radiology education system in two modes: at clinics and in-person workshops. 335 Australian radiologists completed 562 readings of mammogram test sets through the web-based interactive BREAST platform with 325 at conference workshops and 237 at their workplaces. They engaged with test sets with each comprising of 60 mammogram cases (20 cancer and 40 normal). Radiologists marked the location of any cancers and had their performance measured via 5 metrics of diagnostic accuracy. Results show that the location of engagement with BREAST did not yield any significant difference in the performances of all radiologists and the same radiologists between two reading modes (P > 0.05). Radiologists who read screening mammograms for BreastScreen Australia performed better when they completed the test sets at designated workshops (P < 0.05), as was also the case for radiologists who read > 100 cases per week (P < 0.05). In contrast, radiologists who read less mammograms frequently recorded better performances in specificity and JAFROC at clinics (P < 0.05). Findings show that remotely accessed online education for specialised training and core skills building in radiology can provide a similar learning opportunity for breast radiologists when compared to on-site dedicated workshops at scientific meetings. For readers with high volumes of mammograms, a workshop setting may provide a superior experience while clinic setting is more helpful to less experienced readers.","output":"Radiologist Self-training: a Study of Cancer Detection when Reading Mammograms at Work Clinics or Workshops"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (2019 coronavirus disease, COVID-19) since December 2019, from Wuhan, China, has been posing a significant threat to global human health.

The PSIDS have a high ranking in the Climate Risk Index and the World Risk Index. Financial losses due to climate-induced disasters, in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), are also high in the Pacific region. While climate risk insurance solutions could play a key role in the efficient distribution of recovery resources, there are many challenges to their successful implementation. Effective climate risk insurance products for the vulnerable sections of these societies are almost non-existent in this part of the world. Among the worst climate-induced disasters to affect the PSIDS are those related to cyclones and floods. These not only adversely impact the welfare of the households affected by these disasters, but they lower the long-term development potential of the countries involved. There is also evidence to suggest that climate-induced disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity over time due to climate change. It is against this background that an inquiry into the necessity for climate risk insurance products in the context of PSIDS should take place. This paper gives a comprehensive review of the literature addressing climate risk insurance as a risk mitigation or climate adaptation tool for managing the climate-induced financial vulnerabilities in the PSIDS. The paper explores the affordability of climate risk insurance, particularly among the vulnerable sections of society, and discusses the challenges of implementing an appropriate climate risk insurance model in the region. Finally, it examines recent climate risk insurance initiatives that have been attempted by multilateral agencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Pacific Financial Inclusion Practice (UNCDF), Pacific Insurance and Climate Adaptation Programme (PICAP), and respective local governments.","output":"Climate risk insurance in Pacific Small Island Developing States: possibilities, challenges and vulnerabilitiesa comprehensive review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the influence of disease-modifying therapies (DMT) for MS on COVID-19 are unknown. To date, patients with MS have not been shown to present greater risk of COVID-19 or more severe progression of the disease. Methods: We performed a descriptive study of patients with MS presenting SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed with PCR. We analysed demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment variables in our sample. Presence of antibodies against the virus was also determined. Results: Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) was the most frequent form of MS in our sample. Prognosis was unfavourable in 10.2% of patients, and was associated with older age and higher scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 83.3% in our sample. Development of antibodies was not associated with DMT, lymphocytopaenia, or any of the other variables analysed. Conclusions: The incidence of COVID-19 was slightly higher in our sample than in the general population in our province. Unfavourable prognosis was associated with older age and higher EDSS scores. DMT and lymphocytopaenia did not influence the clinical course of COVID-19. Seroprevalence of antibodies against the virus in our sample was similar to that reported for the general population with positive PCR results for the virus; the influence of specific DMTs could not be determined.","output":"Infeccin por SARS-CoV-2 y seroprevalencia en pacientes con esclerosis mltiple"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiple manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described in the literature.

Among all, the recent discoveries relating to RNA-G4s, including their potential involvement as antiviral targets against COVID-19, have triggered the ever-increasing need to develop selective molecules able to interact with parallel G4s. Naphthalene diimides (NDIs) are widely exploited as G4 ligands, being able to induce and strongly stabilize these structures. Sometimes, a reversible NDI-G4 interaction is also associated with an irreversible one, due to the cleavage and/or modification of G4s by functional-NDIs. This is the case of NDI-Cu-DETA, a copper(II) complex able to cleave G4s in the closest proximity to the target binding site. Herein, we present two original Cu(II)-NDI complexes, inspired by NDI-Cu-DETA, differently functionalized with 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol side-chains, to selectively drive redox-catalyzed activity towards parallel G4s. The selective interaction toward parallel G4 topology, controlled by the presence of 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol side chains, was already firmly demonstrated by us using core-extended NDIs. In the present study, the presence of protonable moieties and the copper(II) cavity, increases the binding affinity and specificity of these two NDIs for a telomeric RNA-G4. Once defined the copper coordination relationship and binding constants by competition titrations, ability in G4 stabilization, and ROS-induced cleavage were analyzed. The propensity in the stabilization of parallel topology was highlighted for both of the new compounds HP2Cu and PE2Cu.

METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from 501 participants who were &#8805;18 years. Exposure to COVID-19 news was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for depression (outcome variable) with the Patient Health Questionnaire and examined the roles of risk perceptions.

The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 16 patients with advanced HFrEF who developed COVID-19 between 1 March and 29 May 2020. Follow-up lasted until 30 September. Ten patients previously hospitalized with decompensated HFrEF were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during hospitalization. Six patients undergoing ambulatory care at initiation of COVID-19 symptoms were hospitalized because of advanced HFrEF. All patients who experienced worsening of HFrEF due to COVID-19 required higher doses or introduction of additional inotropic drugs or intra-aortic balloon pump in the intensive care unit. The mean intravenous dobutamine dose before SARS-CoV-2 infection in previously hospitalized patients (n = 10) and the median (inter-quartile range) peak intravenous dobutamine dose during SARS-CoV-2 infection in all patients (n = 16) were 2 (0-7) g/kg/min and 20 (14-20) (P < 0.001), respectively. During follow-up, 56% underwent heart transplantation (n = 2) or died (n = 7). Four patients died during hospitalization from mixed shock consequent to severe acute respiratory syndrome with inflammatory storm syndrome associated with septic and cardiogenic shock during COVID-19. After COVID-19 recovery, two patients died from mixed septic and cardiogenic shock and one from sustained ventricular tachycardia and cardiogenic shock. Five patients were discharged from hospital to ambulatory care. Four were awaiting heart transplantation. CONCLUSION: Worsening of advanced HF by COVID-19 is associated with high mortality.

The compound is formed during fermentation and the following mash storage by enzymatic hydrolysis of naturally present pectins. Methanol is toxic above certain threshold levels and legal limits have been set in most jurisdictions. Therefore, the methanol content needs to be mitigated and its level must be controlled. This article will review the several factors that influence the methanol content including the pH value of the mash, the addition of various yeast and enzyme preparations, fermentation temperature, mash storage, and most importantly the raw material quality and hygiene. From all these mitigation possibilities, lowering the pH value and the use of cultured yeasts when mashing fruit substances is already common as best practice today. Also a controlled yeast fermentation at acidic pH facilitates not only reduced methanol formation, but ultimately also leads to quality benefits of the distillate. Special care has to be observed in the case of spirits made from coffee by-products which are prone to spoilage with very high methanol contents reported in past studies.","output":"Methanol Mitigation during Manufacturing of Fruit Spirits with Special Consideration of Novel Coffee Cherry Spirits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, the practice of global emergency medicine (GEM) has involved being on the ground supporting in-country training of local learners, conducting research, and providing clinical care This face-to-face interaction has been understood as critically important for developing partnerships and building trust The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant uncertainty worldwide, including international travel restrictions of indeterminate permanence Following the 2020 Society for Academic Emergency Medicine meeting, the Global Emergency Medicine Academy (GEMA) sought to enhance collective understanding of best practices in GEM training with a focus on multidirectional education and remote collaboration in the setting of COVID-19 GEMA members led an initiative to outline thematic areas deemed most pertinent to the continued implementation of impactful GEM programming within the physical and technologic confines of a pandemic Eighteen GEM practitioners were divided into four workgroups to focus on the following themes: advances in technology, valuation, climate impacts, skill translation, research/scholastic projects, and future challenges Several opportunities were identified: broadened availability of technology such as video conferencing, Internet, and smartphones;online learning;reduced costs of cloud storage and printing;reduced carbon footprint;and strengthened local leadership Skills and knowledge bases of GEM practitioners, including practicing in resource-poor settings and allocation of scarce resources, are translatable domestically The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a paradigm shift in the practice of GEM, identifying a previously underrecognized potential to both strengthen partnerships and increase accessibility This time of change has provided an opportunity to enhance multidirectional education and remote collaboration to improve global health equity ? 2020 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Prompts a Paradigm Shift in Global Emergency Medicine: Multidirectional Education and Remote Collaboration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces the model of Utilitarian Principlism as a framework for crisis healthcare ethics. In modern Western medicine, during non-crisis times, principlism provides the four guiding principles in biomedical ethics-autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice; autonomy typically emerges as the decisive principle. The physician-patient relationship is a deontological construct in which the physician's primary duty is to the individual patient and the individual patient is paramount. For this reason, we term the non-crisis ethical framework that guides modern medicine Deontological Principlism. During times of crisis, resources become scarce, standards of care become dynamic, and public health ethics move to the forefront. Healthcare providers are forced to work in non-ideal conditions, and interactions with individual patients must be considered in the context of the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare to shift to a more utilitarian framework with a greater focus on promoting the health of communities and populations. This paper puts forth the notion of Utilitarian Principlism as a framework for crisis healthcare ethics. We discuss each of the four principles from a utilitarian perspective and use clinical vignettes, based on real cases from the COVID-19 pandemic, for illustrative purposes. We explore how Deontological Principlism and Utilitarian Principlism are two ends of a spectrum, and the implications to healthcare as we emerge from the pandemic.","output":"Utilitarian Principlism as a Framework for Crisis Healthcare Ethics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow-diverting stents, such as the PED, have emerged as a novel means of treating complex intracranial aneurysms. This retrospective analysis of the initial Canadian experience provides insight into technical challenges, clinical and radiographic outcomes, and complication rates after the use of flow-diverting stents for unruptured aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cases were compiled from 7 Canadian centers between July 2008 and December 2010. Each center prospectively tracked their initial experience; these data were retrospectively updated and pooled for analysis. RESULTS During the defined study period, 97 cases of unruptured aneurysm were treated with the PED, with successful stent deployment in 94 cases. The overall complete or near-complete occlusion rate was 83%, with a median follow-up at 1.25 years (range 0.25-2.5 years). Progressive occlusion was witnessed over time, with complete or near-complete occlusion in 65% of aneurysms followed through 6 months, and 90% of aneurysms followed through 1 year. Multivariate analysis found previous aneurysm treatment and female sex predictive of persistent aneurysm filling. Most patients were stable or improved (88%), with the most favorable outcomes observed in patients with cavernous carotid aneurysms. The overall mortality rate was 6%. Postprocedural aneurysm hemorrhage occurred in 3 patients (3%), while ipsilateral distal territory hemorrhage was observed in 4 patients (3.4%).

A specifically designed questionnaire was delivered to community residents in Changsha (the capital city of Hunan province) with a total of 1,249 completed forms returned and statistically analyzed. The majority of the participants considered that brain donation would help medical research and education, and 32.0% of respondents agreed that the brain donation would help change the traditional Chinese funeral belief in keeping the body intact after death. However, participants aged over 60 years old were less supportive of this concept. Among all participants, 63.7% stated that they were not knowledgeable about brain donation, while 26.4% explicitly expressed a willingness to participate in brain donation. Age, gender, monthly household income, and knowledge about brain donation significantly affected the willingness. Compared with other age groups, a higher proportion of participants aged over 60 years old preferred to be informed by a medical college. To promote brain donation in China, especially among the elderly, better communication of its medical benefits and a reinterpretation of the Confucius view of the human body should be provided.

Although not yet approved for pediatric use by Health Canada, it has been occasionally offered by asthma specialists as a therapeutic trial in children with troublesome asthma or treatment for adverse effects. The objective of this study was to describe the indications and real-life clinical experience in initiating tiotropium in children with asthma. METHODS: We designed a retrospective mixed-method case series study of children aged 1C17 years who initiated tiotropium in our tertiary-care centre between 2013 and 2020. Clinical information was extracted from electronic medical records and tiotropium dispensing, from drug claims. Parents/children and physicians independently completed a questionnaire about treatment goals, perceived efficacy, safety, satisfaction, and lessons learned. RESULTS: The 34 (11 females; 23 males) children had a median (range) age of 9.1 (1.4C17.8) years. Children were primarily on Step 4 (85%) or 5 (6%) prior to tiotropium initiation, yet most (84%) did not increase their treatment step after tiotropium initiation. The physicians treatment goals were to improve asthma control, alleviate adverse effects of current therapy, and/or improve lung function. The most improved symptoms were coughing/moist cough, difficulty breathing, whistling breath, and bronchial secretions/mucus. Although most parents and physicians reported a significant benefit with tiotropium bromide, physicians particularly remarked, as their lesson learned, on the improvement in chronic symptoms in asthmatic children, particularly those with prominent moist cough and in lung function, in those with seemingly none (or incompletely) reversible obstruction as well as the ability to decrease the ICS and/or LABA dose to lessen adverse effects. A few physicians raised caution on the risk of lower adherence with an additional inhaler. CONCLUSION: In children with severe asthma on Step 4 or 5, tiotropium bromide was primarily used as substitute, rather than additional, adjunct therapy to improve asthma control, alleviate adverse effects, and/or to improve lung function. The latter two indications, combined with its perceived effectiveness in children with prominent moist cough, also suggest additional indications of tiotropium to be formally explored.","output":"Tiotropium bromide as adjunct therapy in children with asthma: a clinical experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sodium restriction is often recommended in heart failure (HF) to block symptomatic edema, despite limited evidence for benefit. However, a low-sodium diet (LSD) activates the classical renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which may adversely affect HF progression and mortality in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We performed a randomized, blinded pre-clinical trial to compare the effects of a normal (human-equivalent) sodium diet and a LSD on HF progression in a normotensive model of DCM in mice that has translational relevance to human HF. The LSD reduced HF progression by suppressing the development of pleural effusions (p < 0.01), blocking pathological increases in systemic extracellular water (p < 0.001) and prolonging median survival (15%, p < 0.01). The LSD activated the classical RAAS by increasing plasma renin activity, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels. However, the LSD also significantly up-elevated the counter-regulatory RAAS by boosting plasma angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and angiotensin (1C7) levels, promoting nitric oxide bioavailability and stimulating 3-5-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. Plasma HF biomarkers associated with poor outcomes, such as B-type natriuretic peptide and neprilysin were decreased by a LSD. Cardiac systolic function, blood pressure and renal function were not affected. Although a LSD activates the classical RAAS system, we conclude that the LSD delayed HF progression and mortality in experimental DCM, in part through protective stimulation of the counter-regulatory RAAS to increase plasma ACE2 and angiotensin (1C7) levels, nitric oxide bioavailability and cGMP production.","output":"A Low-Sodium Diet Boosts Ang (1C7) Production and NO-cGMP Bioavailability to Reduce Edema and Enhance Survival in Experimental Heart Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Editorial sets the stage for 18 papers on the theme, Contemplative inquiry, wellbeing and science education. The special issue consists of a diverse set of papers that complement one another while each contributes in unique ways that will stimulate reflexive practices among the science education community as they ponder how they can contribute to the resolution of global challenges that define our lifetimes. In this Editorial we address priorities for improved science literacy for a worldwide community so that moment-to-moment practices can reduce the world's carbon footprint and reverse global warming and related challenges such as species extinction. We posit that to meet particulars of global challenges facing humanity, science educators need to expand their roles and definitions of science education. Accordingly, in an era of COVID-19, there is an imperative to expand and deepen functional literacy in science and in particular wellness for everyone as part of a necessary education on the birth through death continuum. Our advocacy for the use of authentic inquiry affords learning from research and ensuring that all research participants have opportunities to learn from ongoing research and one another. We expect that all participants will benefit equitably from being involved in research. Participants are educated about what is learned from research in which they are involved, and how that improves their practices. We anticipate that much of what is learned from such research will be enacted in everyday life, thereby affording those with whom they interact to learn by being-with them. Because of the complex, chaotic and dynamic nature of today's world and its associated lifestyles, we address contemplative activities we regard as highly appropriate for doing science in a manner that is restorative and nurturing for ourselves and for the world. Specifically, we examine breathing meditation, meditating to increase blood oxygenation, walking meditation, loving kindness meditation, soft touch energy work and mindfulness. Each of these contemplative activities relates to knowing thyself better and promoting and sustaining wellness and wellbeing. We address self-help in relation to wellness because so many people follow one or two pathways when they become sick, i.e., they rest until their health improves and/or they go to the doctor who may diagnose/prescribe pharmaceuticals or changes in aspects of lifestyle (e.g., diet, more sleep). We provide examples of self-help practices that allow individuals to be autonomous and proactive in avoiding sickness, and directly addressing symptoms if and when necessary. Finally, we examine the potential of using a dialectical approach to teaching, learning and future rethinking of science education and science educators. Grand challenges of the moment demand no less than ongoing research with transformations that catalyze improvements now. We do not have a luxury of waiting for the right time, and the right time to enact sustainable lifestyles is now.","output":"Global challenges need attention now: educating humanity for wellness and sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tubulin polymerization promoting protein family member 3 (TPPP3) is a kind of protein that can mediate the dynamics and stability of microtubules.

The related pathways involved in TPPP3 were analyzed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and the correlation between TPPP3 and immune infiltration was studied by Tumor Immune Estimation Resource2.0 (TIMER 2.0). The TPPP3 expression was significantly reduced in head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) compared to adjacent tissues. In addition, the low expression of TPPP3 in HNSC was significantly associated with prognosis. The pathways closely related to the low expression of TPPP3 are \\"Antigen Processing and Presentation,\\" \\"Primary Immunodeficiency,\\" and so on. The TPPP3 expression was negatively correlated with the level of CD8+ T cell, B cell, and myeloid dendritic cell infiltration in HNSC. The TPPP3 expression is closely related to multiple immunomarkers in CD8+ T cell and Myeloid dendritic cells. These data indicate that TPPP3 is associated with multiple cancers and involves multiple immune-related pathways, and TPPP3 is associated with immune infiltration levels. Besides, the TPPP3 expression may help regulate tumor-associated CD8 + T cells, DC cells in HNSC.

PURPOSE A case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) occurring as a reaction to ustekinumab therapy is reported. SUMMARY After starting ustekinumab for treatment of psoriatric arthritis, a 46-year-old female presented with flu-like symptoms and cough with blood-tinged sputum that had begun 1 week previously. Her initial computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities. On bronchoscopy, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) return became bloodier from sample 1 to samples 2 and 3. Her BAL fluid was more than 90% hemosiderin-laden macrophages, a finding consistent with DAH. We ruled out infectious etiologies and other common vasculitis conditions that can cause DAH. A diagnosis of ustekinumab-induced DAH was made due to a temporal relationship between initiation of the drug and the patient's presentation and the absence of infection and other alternate diagnosis. Prior case reports including ustekinumab-induced pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease with a granulomatous component, and lupus syndrome have been reported, with this being the first case of DAH in a patient undergoing treatment of psoriatic arthritis. CONCLUSION A 46-year-old woman developed DAH during ustekinumab treatment. Symptoms abated after drug discontinuation and supportive treament.

Here, we show results from the first in-human trials using non-invasive ultrasound stimulation of the spleen to reduce cytokine release in the context of both an acute response in healthy subjects and a chronic inflammatory condition in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Splenic ultrasound results in a reduction in TNF serum levels, as well as IL-1B; and IL-8 transcript levels in monocytes. There is also a down regulation of pathways involved in TNF and IL-6 production, and IFNgamma- and NFKB-regulated genes. Many of these cytokines or pathways are upregulated in COVID-19 patients. There is also a reduction in chemokine transcript levels and other components of the chemotactic response, suggesting that reduction of cellular migration may contribute to the therapeutic effects of ultrasound. There is no inhibition of the adaptive immune response with ultrasound treatment relating to antibody production. This is consistent with a pre-clinical animal model where enhanced antibody production was achieved with splenic ultrasound. Therefore, this new splenic ultrasound approach has the potential to treat acute and chronic hyper-inflammatory diseases, as it lowers cytokine levels without disrupting the normal adaptive immune response. Portable ultrasound technologies are currently being developed and translated to the clinic to treat various inflammatory disorders, with more recent efforts directed towards combatting the hyperinflammation or cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Calming the Cytokine Storm - Splenic Ultrasound for Treating Inflammatory Disorders and Potentially COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pivotal role played by ion-channel dysregulations in the pathogenesis of epilepsy has always garnered much attention. Since mutation of ion-channel proteins CACNA1A and GABRD have been associated with epilepsy, it is important to determine the post-traumatic epilepsy-associated changes in expression levels of these ion channel proteins. Additionally, curcumin is already known for its antiepileptic and neuroprotective potential in FeCl3-induced model of post-traumatic epilepsy. Thus, we investigated FeCl3-induced epilepsy mediated differential expression of CACNA1A and GABRD in the cortical region of the rat brain. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of curcumin on the expression of both proteins. For this, epilepsy was induced by intracortical FeCl3 injection (5 l of 100 mM). Additionally, curcumin (conc. 1000 ppm; 75 mg/kg of b.wt.; for 14 and 28 days) was administered, mixed with normal food pellets. Results obtained from EEG-MUA and Morris water maze assay demonstrate the progression of epilepsy after FeCl3 injection. Additionally, western blotting and histological studies show the downregulation of CACNA1A and GABRD during epileptogenesis. It was observed that epilepsy-associated decline in learning and memory of animals might be linked with the dysregulation of both proteins. Results also demonstrated that curcumin administration ameliorated epilepsy-associated change in expression of both CACNA1A and GABRD proteins.

Methods We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science for published articles, from their inception to 9 July 2019, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Studies reporting the correlation between CSF and blood NfL in humans were included. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the overall pooled correlation coefficient estimate, accounting for correlation technique and assay used. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic test. In sensitivity analyses, we calculated the pooled correlation coefficient estimate according to blood NfL assay: single-molecule array digital immunoassay (Simoa), electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay or ELISA. Results Data were extracted from 36 articles, including 3961 paired CSF and blood NfL samples. Overall, 26/36 studies measured blood NfL using Simoa, 8/36 ECL, 1/36 ELISA and 1 study reported all three assay results. The overall meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled correlation coefficient estimate for CSF and blood NfL was r=0.72. Heterogeneity was significant: I2=83%, p<0.01. In sensitivity analyses, the pooled correlation coefficient was similar for studies measuring blood NfL using Simoa and ECL (r=0.69 and r=0.68, respectively) but weaker for ELISA (r=0.35). Conclusion Moderate correlations are demonstrated between CSF and blood NfL, especially when blood NfL was measured using Simoa and ECL. Given its high analytical sensitivity, Simoa is the preferred assay for measuring NfL, especially at low or physiological concentrations, and this meta-analysis supports its use as the current most advanced surrogate measure of CSF NfL.

The urinary phthalate metabolite mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono-2-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) were negatively associated with breast cancer (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60C0.90; OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58C0.98, respectively). However, the overall ORs for BPA, mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), and mono-butyl phthalate (MBP) were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.69C1.05), 0.96 (95% CI: 0.62C1.48), 1.12 (95% CI: 0.88C1.42), 1.13 (95% CI: 0.74C1.73), 1.01 (95% CI: 0.74C1.40), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.48C1.14), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55C1.15), respectively, suggesting no significant association. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were relatively stable. Conclusion: Phthalate metabolites MBzP and MiBP were passively associated with breast cancer, whereas no associations were found between BPA, MEP, MEHHP, MEHP, MEOHP, MCPP, and MBP and breast cancer. More high-quality case-control studies or persuasive cohort studies are urgently needed to draw the best conclusions.","output":"The Association of Bisphenol A and Phthalates with Risk of Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Role of microaspiration of mucus mixed with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2) causing pneumonia is lacking in searched literature. Recently some authors have emphasized on microaspiration. SARS-CoV-2 primarily replicates in nasal mucosa and sheds in nasal mucus which travels down as microaspiration and causes pneumonia. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of normal saline nasal spray and gargle (NSNSG) to wash off SARS-CoV-2 from nasal and pharyngeal mucosa to prevent microaspiration and pneumonia. Methods: : From RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) report, we selected 62 patients for study group and 63 patients for control, having higher virion load i.e. cycle threshold (Ct) value 25 or less. Patients in study group were trained with NSNSG. We reviewed HRCT (high resolution computed tomogram) of lung in 56 patients of both groups for severity score (SS) in lung and was compared with initial HRCT Results: : Thirty out of 62 (48%) of study group significantly ( p =001) became RT-PCR negative following NSNSG compared to 16 out of 63 patients (25%) of control. Thirty one out of 34 patients (91%) of study group either improved or inhibited progression of SS in lung HRCT. In control group, 14 out of 22 patients (63%) also showed favourable findings. Nevertheless, study group significantly improved ( p =0028) in SS. Conclusions: : NSNSG is significantly efficacious to wash off SARS-CoV-2 from nasal cavity and pharynx, and to break supply chain of SARS-CoV-2 from source to prevent microaspiration in lung alveoli and pneumonia. From that phenomenon we infer that SARS-CoV-2 as a surface virus and it seems that vaccine resistant SARS-CoV-2 and different strains of SARS-CoV-2 would be washed off with NSNSG.","output":"Efficacy of normal saline nasal spray and gargle on SARS-CoV-2 for prevention of COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, continues to impact all facets of daily life.

However, these conservation zones are frequently established without adequate knowledge of the movement patterns of the species they are designed to protect. Understanding movement and foraging patterns of species in dynamic and diverse habitats can allow managers to develop more effective conservation plans. Threatened lemurs in Madagascar are an example where management plans and protected areas are typically created to encompass large, extant forests rather than consider the overall resource needs of the target species. METHODS: To gain an understanding of golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) movement patterns, including space use and habitat selection across their range of inhabited forest types, we combined behavior data with Dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models and Resource Selection Functions. We also examined the influence of abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic factors on home range size, movement rates, and foraging patterns. RESULTS: We found that home range size and movement rates differed between seasons, with increased core area size and movement in the rainy season. Forest type also played a role in foraging behavior with sifaka groups in the humid forest avoiding roads in both seasons, groups in the dry deciduous forest avoiding road networks in the rainy season, and groups in the moderate evergreen forest displaying no selection or avoidance of road networks while foraging. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates the importance of studying primate groups across seasons and forest types, as developing conservation plans from a single snapshot can give an inaccurate assessment of their natural behavior and resources needs of the species. More specifically, by understanding how forest type influences golden-crowned sifaka movement and foraging behavior, conservation management plans can be made to the individual forest types inhabited (dry deciduous, moderate evergreen, humid, littoral, etc.), rather than the region as a whole.","output":"Environmental and anthropogenic influences on movement and foraging in a critically endangered lemur species, Propithecus tattersalli: implications for habitat conservation planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While drug resistant mutations in HIV-1 are largely credited to its error prone HIV-1 RT, the time point in the infection cycle that these mutations can arise and if they appear spontaneously without selection pressures both remained enigmatic. Many HIV-1 RT mutational in vitro studies utilized reporter genes (LacZ) as a template to investigate these questions, thereby not accounting for the possible contribution of viral codon usage. To address this gap, we investigated HIV-1 RT mutation rates and biases on its own Gag, protease, and RT p66 genes in an in vitro selection pressure free system. We found rare clinical mutations with a general avoidance of crucial functional sites in the background mutations rates for Gag, protease, and RT p66 at 4.71  10-5, 6.03  10-5, and 7.09  10-5 mutations/bp, respectively. Gag and p66 genes showed a large number of 'A to G' mutations. Comparisons with silently mutated p66 sequences showed an increase in mutation rates (1.88  10-4 mutations/bp) and that 'A to G' mutations occurred in regions reminiscent of ADAR neighbor sequence preferences. Mutational free energies of the 'A to G' mutations revealed an avoidance of destabilizing effects, with the natural p66 gene codon usage providing barriers to disruptive amino acid changes. Our study demonstrates the importance of studying mutation emergence in HIV genes in a RT-PCR in vitro selection pressure free system to understand how fast drug resistance can emerge, providing transferable applications to how new viral diseases and drug resistances can emerge.","output":"Spontaneous Mutations in HIV-1 Gag, Protease, RT p66 in the First Replication Cycle and How They Appear: Insights from an In Vitro Assay on Mutation Rates and Types."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To track the European spread of SARS-CoV-2, decentralized testing became necessary and test capacity needed to be expanded outside reference laboratories rapidly.

To improve age-depth model resolution for the recent period, sediment dating with lead-210 ($^{210}$Pb) is widely used as it provides absolute and continuous dates for the last $\\\\sim$ 100 - 150 years. The $^{210}$Pb dating method has traditionally relied on the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS, also known as Constant Flux - CF) model which uses the radioactive decay equation as an age-depth relationship resulting in a restrictive model to approximate dates. In this work, we compare the classical approach to $^{210}$Pb dating (CRS) and its Bayesian alternative (\\\\textit{Plum}). To do so, we created simulated $^{210}$Pb profiles following three different sedimentation processes, complying with the assumptions imposed by the CRS model, and analysed them using both approaches. Results indicate that the CRS model does not capture the true values even with a high dating resolution for the sediment, nor improves does its accuracy improve as more information is available.

After hospitalization for COVID-19, a number of patients are referred to medical rehabilitation centers or skilled nursing facilities for further treatment, while others go home with or without aftercare. The aftercare paths include 1] community-based rehabilitation; 2] in- and outpatient medical rehabilitation; 3] inpatient rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities; and 4] sheltered care (inpatient). These aftercare paths and the trajectories of recovery after COVID-19 urgently need long-term in-depth evaluation to optimize and personalize treatment. CO-FLOW aims, by following the outcomes and aftercare paths of all COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge, to systematically study over a 2-year period: 1] trajectories of physical, cognitive, and psychological recovery; 2] patient flows, healthcare utilization, patient satisfaction with aftercare, and barriers/facilitators regarding aftercare as experienced by healthcare professionals; 3] effects of physical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes on participation and HRQoL; and 4] predictors for long-term recovery, health care utilization, and patient satisfaction with aftercare. METHODS: CO-FLOW is a multicenter prospective cohort study in the mid-west of the Netherlands with a 2-year follow-up period. Measurements comprise non-invasive clinical tests and patient reported outcome measures from a combined rehabilitation, pulmonary, and intensive care perspective.

India also strictly implemented a countrywide lockdown, starting from 24 March to 12 May 2020. This measure resulted in the reduction of the sources of air pollution in general: industrial, commercial, and vehicular pollution in particular, with visible improvement in ambient air quality. In this study, the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the ambient concentration of air pollutants over the city of Bangalore (India) is assessed using Continuous Ambient Air Quality Measurement (CAAQM) data from 10 monitoring stations spread across the city. The data was obtained from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). The analysis of the relative changes in the ambient concentration of six major air pollutants (NO, NO(2), NO(X), PM(2.5), O(3), and SO(2)) has been carried out for two periods: MarchCMay 2020 (COVID-19 lockdown) and the corresponding period of 2019 during when there was no lockdown. The analysis revealed significant reduction in the concentration of ambient air pollutants at both daily and monthly intervals. This can be attributed to the reduction in sources of emission; vehicular traffic, industrial, and other activities. The average reduction in the concentration of NO, NO(2), NO(X), PM(2.5), and O(3) between 01 March and 12 May 2020 was found to be 63%, 48%, 48%, 18%, and 23% respectively when compared to the same period in 2019. Similarly, the comparative analysis of pollutant concentrations between pre-lockdown (01C23 March 2020) and lockdown (24 MarchC12 May 2020) periods has shown a huge reduction in the ambient concentration of air pollutants, 47.3% (NO), 49% (NO(2)), 49% (NO(X)), 10% (SO(2)), 37.7% (PM(2.5)), and 15.6% (O(3)), resulting in improved air quality over Bangalore during the COVID-19 lockdown period. It is shown that the strict lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in the pollution levels.

METHOD From December 2007 to November 2011, all female patients with ODS were prospectively evaluated with full interview, clinical examination and anorectal physiology testing. The characteristics of patients with and without rectoceles were compared, and logistic regression was utilized to identify factors predictive of patients having a rectocele beyond the introitus. RESULTS Of 239 patients with ODS, 90 (mean age: 52.3  1.7 years) had a rectocele. Patients with rectoceles (R+) had a similar prevalence of incomplete emptying compared with patients with no rectocele (R-) (P  0.21), but only R+ patients reported splinting with defaecation (36.7% vs 0%; P < 0.0001). Anorectal manometry measurements, including mean resting pressure, maximum resting pressure and maximum squeeze pressure, were similar between groups (P  0.12). There were also no significant differences in rectal compliance (maximum tolerated volume) or rectal sensitivity (volume of first sensation) (P  0.65). R+ patients had greater difficulty expelling a 60 cm(3) balloon (70.1% R+ patients vs 57.5% R- patients; P = 0.05), but the prevalence of pelvic floor dyssynergia, as quantified by nonrelaxation on electromyography (EMG) testing, was similar to that of R- patients (P = 0.49). Logistic regression suggested that only difficulty with balloon expulsion was associated with higher odds of having a rectocele (OR = 3.00; P = 0.002), whereas mean resting pressure, EMG nonrelaxation and symptoms of incomplete emptying were not (P  0.12). CONCLUSION Rectoceles are not associated with an increased severity of ODS-type symptoms, anorectal abnormalities or pelvic floor dyssynergia in patients with ODS.

Institutions consider how much weight to give activities in each of these areas and determine a threshold for advancement. With the emergence of social media, scholars can engage wider audiences in creative ways and have a broader impact. Conventional metrics like the h-index do not account for social media impact. Social media engagement is poorly represented in most curricula vitae (CV) and therefore is undervalued in promotion and tenure reviews. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop crowdsourced guidelines for documenting social media scholarship. These guidelines aimed to provide a structure for documenting a scholar's general impact on social media, as well as methods of documenting individual social media contributions exemplifying innovation, education, mentorship, advocacy, and dissemination. METHODS: To create unifying guidelines, we created a crowdsourced process that capitalized on the strengths of social media and generated a case example of successful use of the medium for academic collaboration. The primary author created a draft of the guidelines and then sought input from users on Twitter via a publicly accessible Google Document. There was no limitation on who could provide input and the work was done in a democratic, collaborative fashion. Contributors edited the draft over a period of 1 week (September 12-18, 2020). The primary and secondary authors then revised the draft to make it more concise. The guidelines and manuscript were then distributed to the contributors for edits and adopted by the group. All contributors were given the opportunity to serve as coauthors on the publication and were told upfront that authorship would depend on whether they were able to document the ways in which they met the 4 International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship criteria. RESULTS: We developed 2 sets of guidelines: Guidelines for Listing All Social Media Scholarship Under Public Scholarship (in Research/Scholarship Section of CV) and Guidelines for Listing Social Media Scholarship Under Research, Teaching, and Service Sections of CV. Institutions can choose which set fits their existing CV format. CONCLUSIONS: With more uniformity, scholars can better represent the full scope and impact of their work. These guidelines are not intended to dictate how individual institutions should weigh social media contributions within promotion and tenure cases.

As a first step towards examining the dynamics of the protein in solution with and without ligand, we have assigned the backbone 13C, 15N, and 1HN resonances of NfsB and examined the effect of the binding of nicotinate on the amide 15N, and 1HN shifts.","output":"Backbone assignment of E. coli NfsB and the effects of addition of the cofactor analogue nicotinic acid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the enormous increase in data size, the complexity of finding duplicate data is recognized as one of the significant challenges. Elimination of duplicate data is an essential step in data cleaning as redundant data can affect a system's performance in the data processing. In order to do this deduplication technique is used to eliminate the duplicated data at the file or content level which helps to only store one copy of the file in the database. In this paper a technique is proposed to solve the storage issues and deduplication where the Hadoop Distributed File System is used to solve the vast amount of data storage issues and to identify the duplicate data a cryptography algorithm SHA 256 is used. Finally, HBase a non-relational distributed database including Hive Integration is used for data retrieval.

When stressors are repeated, the organism adapts, although these adaptive responses can become dysregulated and result in disease, causing gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Radiographic methods allow the non-invasive study of how a given factor affects GI transit in the same animal at different time points. These methods have never been applied to study the consequences of stress on GI motor function and their dependency on time and stimulus. Therefore, our aim was to characterize, using radiographic techniques, the effect on GI transit of cold-restraint (CR) and forced swim (FS) stress applied acutely and subchronically in the rat. METHODS Male Wistar rats (260-330 g) were submitted to FS or CR stress, during 1 (acute) or 4 (subchronic) consecutive days. To study GI transit, radiographic methods were used. Radiographs were taken 0-24 h after barium intragastric administration on the 1st or 4th day of stress, which was applied 1 h after contrast. RESULTS Acute FS or CR slowed down gastric and small intestinal emptying but had opposite effects in the caecum: CR tended to accelerate barium transit and feces formation while FS tended to slow these parameters down. When the stimuli were applied subchronically, GI transit was not completely normalized in most of the studied parameters. CONCLUSION AND INFERENCES Mild stress alters GI transit differently depending on the nature of the stressor and its duration. Exposure to mild stressors should be considered as contributing factors to different functional GI disorders.","output":"Effects of two different acute and subchronic stressors on gastrointestinal transit in the rat: A radiographic analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, strict measures took place in Finland to limit the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an unprecedented \\"infodemic\\"; the velocity and volume of data production have overwhelmed many key stakeholders such as clinicians and policy makers, as they have been unable to process structured and unstructured data for evidence-based decision making. Solutions that aim to alleviate this data synthesis-related challenge are unable to capture heterogeneous web data in real time for the production of concomitant answers and are not based on the high-quality information in responses to a free-text query. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this project is to build a generic, real-time, continuously updating curation platform that can support the data synthesis and analysis of a scientific literature framework. Our secondary objective is to validate this platform and the curation methodology for COVID-19-related medical literature by expanding the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset via the addition of new, unstructured data. METHODS: To create an infrastructure that addresses our objectives, the PanSurg Collaborative at Imperial College London has developed a unique data pipeline based on a web crawler extraction methodology. This data pipeline uses a novel curation methodology that adopts a human-in-the-loop approach for the characterization of quality, relevance, and key evidence across a range of scientific literature sources. RESULTS: REDASA (Realtime Data Synthesis and Analysis) is now one of the world's largest and most up-to-date sources of COVID-19-related evidence; it consists of 104,000 documents. By capturing curators' critical appraisal methodologies through the discrete labeling and rating of information, REDASA rapidly developed a foundational, pooled, data science data set of over 1400 articles in under 2 weeks. These articles provide COVID-19-related information and represent around 10% of all papers about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This data set can act as ground truth for the future implementation of a live, automated systematic review. The three benefits of REDASA's design are as follows: (1) it adopts a user-friendly, human-in-the-loop methodology by embedding an efficient, user-friendly curation platform into a natural language processing search engine; (2) it provides a curated data set in the JavaScript Object Notation format for experienced academic reviewers' critical appraisal choices and decision-making methodologies; and (3) due to the wide scope and depth of its web crawling method, REDASA has already captured one of the world's largest COVID-19-related data corpora for searches and curation.","output":"Using a Secure, Continually Updating, Web Source Processing Pipeline to Support the Real-Time Data Synthesis and Analysis of Scientific Literature: Development and Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All sports were discontinued in 2020 with the arrival of COVID-19.

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infection periods and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infected human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 19, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.38 at day 22 and 0.64 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 14000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic. We plan to perform again these calculations and publish a short note when the epidemic is over and the complete and precise data is available. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the isolation.","output":"A simulation of a COVID-19 epidemic based on a deterministic SEIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus COVID-19 shocking the whole world due to its highly contagious characteristics implicating not only public health, but also economy and social life.

Although soft tissue filler procedures are relatively quick and safe, adverse events such as late inflammatory reactions have been reported with every filler product. Infections and vaccinations have been proposed as potential triggers for late inflammatory reactions (LIRs), and it is therefore not surprising that these adverse events have been reported after SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and vaccination. Therefore, this review aims to give a detailed overview of these cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was undertaken on LIRs in patients with a history of soft tissue filler use after SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection or vaccination. This systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. We searched the electronic database PubMed from January 2020 to August 2021. Data on patient characteristics, filler characteristics, clinical findings, and treatment options were included. RESULTS: This review included 7 articles with a total of 19 patients with LIRs after SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection or vaccination. Three patients with postinfection LIRs and 16 patients with postvaccination LIRs were reported. These LIRS mainly occurred in females who had HA injections for cosmetic purposes. Three patients with postinfection LIRs had symptoms of facial swelling and/or lip angioedema in a matter of weeks.

These patients presented with similar clinical symptoms as patients with postinfection LIRs. All patients were treated in a conservative manner. DISCUSSION: This review shows a relationship between LIRs and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and vaccination. In the case of vaccination, these adverse events have been reported only after Moderna and Pfizer vaccinations. The reported adverse events are generally minor and self\\\\limiting, and we encourage patients with soft tissue fillers to participate in vaccination programs.","output":"Late inflammatory reactions in patients with soft tissue fillers after SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and vaccination: A systematic review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycotoxins are toxic metabolites produced by fungal species that commonly present in the global environment, especially in cereals and animal forages. The changing global environment may further increase the exposure to these toxins, posing a serious threat to humans and animals. Recently, coronavirus has become one of the most important pathogens threatening human and animal health. It is not clear whether environmental toxins, such as mycotoxins, will affect coronavirus infection. Given that pigs are among the animals most affected by coronavirus and highly homologous to humans, weaned piglets and IPEC-J2 cells were respectively chosen as in vivo and in vitro model to explore the impacts of deoxynivalenol (DON), the most abundant trichothecene mycotoxin in feed, on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection and the mechanisms involved. In vivo, twenty-seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were randomly divided into three groups, receiving the basal diet containing 0, 750 and 1500 g/kg DON, respectively. Significant increases in the diarrhea rates, gut barrier injury and PEDV proliferation of piglets small intestine were observed in experimental groups compared with the control. Additionally, the autophagosome-like vesicles and the autophagy-related proteins expression were also increased in experimental groups. In vitro, we observed that 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 M DON significantly promoted the entry and replication of PEDV in IPEC-J2 cells, along with the induction of a complete autophagy. CRISPR\\\\Cas9\\\\mediated knockout of LC3B indicated a vital role of autophagy in the promotion. Pretreatment with p38 signaling inhibitor could significantly block the induction of autophagy, indicating that DON could promote the PEDV infection by triggering p38-mediated autophagy.

However, virtually no quantitative studies have examined whether the determinants of research use vary according to the type of research use or phase of policy process. Understanding such variation is important for selecting the targets of implementation strategies that aim to increase the frequency of research use in policymaking. METHODS: A web-based survey of US state agency officials involved with childrens mental health policymaking was conducted between December 2019 and February 2020 (n = 224, response rate = 33.7%, 49 states responding (98%), median respondents per state = 4). The dependent variables were composite scores of the frequency of using childrens mental health research in general, specific types of research use (i.e., conceptual, instrumental, tactical, imposed), and during different phases of the policy process (i.e., agenda setting, policy development, policy implementation). The independent variables were four composite scores of determinants of research use: agency leadership for research use, agency barriers to research use, research use skills, and dissemination barriers (e.g., lack of actionable messages/recommendations in research summaries, lack of interaction/collaboration with researchers). Separate multiple linear regression models estimated associations between determinant and frequency of research use scores. RESULTS: Determinants of research use varied significantly by type of research use and phase of policy process. For example, agency leadership for research use was the only determinant significantly associated with imposed research use ( = 0.31, p < 0.001). Skills for research use were the only determinant associated with tactical research use ( = 0.17, p = 0.03) and were only associated with research use in the agenda-setting phase ( = 0.16, p = 0.04). Dissemination barriers were the most universal determinants of research use, as they were significantly and inversely associated with frequency of conceptual ( = ?0.21, p = 0.01) and instrumental ( = ?0.22, p = 0.01) research use and during all three phases of policy process.

Out of the fungal mycelium from infected leaves, collected from sunflower fields in the four Egyptian Governorates (Kafr El-Sheikh, Gharbia, Giza and El-Beheira), five isolates of powdery mildew pathogen were obtained and identified using morphological and molecular identification methods. Results: In 2019 and 2020 seasons, five biocontrol agents (Bacillus subtilis, B. pumilus, Trichoderma harzianum, T. viride and T. koningii) were used to control powdery mildew disease on sunflower plants under field conditions compared with the fungicide (Vectra 10% SC). Treatments were significantly effective for controlling the powdery mildew disease relative to the control. The best treatment for reducing disease parameters (final disease severity (FDS%), area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and efficacy) than the control was T. koningii. Foliar application of all the tested treatments improved plant height, head and stem diameters and seed yield in relation to untreated plants (control). The components (FDS%, AUDPC and efficacy) were extracted and described approximately 95.251% of the pooled data of seasons 2019 and 2020. In such pooled data, the principal components (PC1, PC2 and PC3) of all disease parameters, plant development parameters and yield components were recorded 76.305, 86.635 and 96.265% of the total variance, respectively.

Since the monitoring, characterization, and cataloging of viral variants are important and the existing information on this was scant for Sicily, this pilot study explored viral variants circulation on this island before and in the growth phase of the second wave of COVID-19 (September and October 2020), and in the downslope of that wave (early December 2020) through sequence analysis of 54 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. The samples were nasopharyngeal swabs collected from Sicilian residents by a state-run one-health surveillance laboratory in Palermo. Variant characterization was based on RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of four regions of the viral genome. The B.1.177 variant was the most prevalent one, strongly predominating before the second wave and also as the wave downsized, although its relative prevalence decreased as other viral variants, particularly B.1.160, contributed to virus circulation.

Several factors influencing risk perception have been identified, including knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states. Prior studies on COVID-19-related risk perception primarily focused on the general public, with little data available on COVID-19 patients. PURPOSE: To investigate COVID-19 patients' risk perception, knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states in the epicenter, Wuhan, during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Data were collected online using self-administered electronic questionnaire developed with reference to previous relevant studies and publications by the World Health Organization. FINDINGS: A higher level of perceived risk was found in relation to COVID-19 as compared to other potential health threats. Knowledge gaps existed regarding transmission and prevention of COVID-19. Additionally, risk perception was negatively related to knowledge and positively related to depressive states. Moreover, social media was a primary source for COVID-19 information, whereas the most trusted sources were health professionals. DISCUSSION: Realistic perception of risk should be encouraged considering both physical and mental health while developing relevant strategies. Furthermore, risk communication needs to be specifically tailored for various target groups, such as the elderly and mentally vulnerable individuals, with the adoption of popular media platforms.","output":"Risk perception, knowledge, information sources and emotional states among COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission in higher education settings is important to limit spread between students, and into at-risk populations.

The needs for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for hospital staff and doctors have been overwhelming, even just to rule out patients not infected. High demand for traditionally manufactured devices, challenged by global demand and limited production, has resulted in a call for additive manufactured (3D printed) equipment to fill the gap between traditional manufacturing cycles. This method has the unique ability to pivot in real time, while traditional manufacturing may take months to change production runs. 3D printing has been used to produce a variety of equipment for hospitals including face shields, masks, and even ventilator components to handle the surge. This type of rapid, crowd sourced, design and production resulted in new challenges for regulation, liability, and distribution. This manuscript reviews these challenges and successes of additive manufacturing and provides a forward plan for hospitals to consider for future surge events. Recommendations: To accommodate future surges, hospitals and municipalities should develop capacity for short-run custom production, enabling them to validate new designs. This will rapidly increase access to vetted equipment and critical network sharing with community distributed manufacturers and partners. Clear guidance and reviewed design repositories by regulatory authorities will streamline efforts to combat future pandemic waives or other surge events.","output":"Leveraging 3D Printing Capacity in Times of Crisis: Recommendations for COVID-19 Distributed Manufacturing for Medical Equipment Rapid Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Governments have begun mass vaccination programmes for COVID-19, but available vaccines do not confer immediate immunity and vaccinated individuals may still be at risk of transmitting the virus. The UK Government has not exempted vaccinated individuals from behavioural measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as practicing social distancing. However, vaccinated individuals may have reduced compliance with these measures, given lower perceived risks. Methods: We used fives waves of monthly panel data from the UK COVID-19 Social Study to assess compliance following vaccination. Compliance was measured with two items on compliance with guidelines in general and compliance with social distancing. We used matching to create comparable groups of individuals by vaccination status and month of vaccination (January vaccination and February vaccination) and used fixed effects models to estimate changes in compliance between October 2020 - February 2021, a period which overlapped with the second wave of COVID-19 in the UK. Results: Vaccinated individuals were broadly keyworkers or older aged individuals. Compliance increased between October 2020 - February 2021, regardless of vaccination status or month of vaccination. There was some evidence that individuals vaccinated in January complied less with social distancing in January and February than matched non-vaccinated individuals, though associations were small and there were no similar clear differences in any month comparing January vaccinated with February vaccinated individuals and February vaccinated with non-vaccinated individuals. Conclusion: There was limited evidence that vaccinated individuals reduced compliance after receiving vaccination. Vaccinated individuals in the sample were older on average and the follow-up period post-vaccination was relatively short (1-2 months).

Integrated pulmonary index (IPI) is a comprehensive respiratory parameter evaluating ventilation and oxygenation. It is calculated from four parameters: end-tidal carbon dioxide, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2), and pulse rate. We hypothesized that IPI monitoring can help predict the occurrence of RC in patients at high-risk of hypoventilation in post-anesthesia care units (PACUs). METHODS This prospective observational study was conducted in two centers and included older adults ( 75-year-old) or obese (body mass index  28) patients who were at high-risk of hypoventilation. Monitoring was started on admission to the PACU after elective surgery under general anesthesia. We investigated the onset of RC defined as respiratory events with prolonged stay in the PACU or transfer to the intensive care units; airway narrowing, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, wheezing, apnea, and any other events that were judged to require interventions. We evaluated the relationship between several initial parameters in the PACU and the occurrence of RC. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between IPI fluctuation during PACU stay and the occurrences of RC using individual standard deviations of the IPI every five minutes (IPI-SDs). RESULTS In total, 288 patients were included (199 elderly, 66 obese, and 23 elderly and obese). Among them, 18 patients (6.3 %) developed RC. The initial IPI and SpO2 values in the PACU in the RC group were significantly lower than those in the non-RC group (6.7  2.5 vs. 9.0  1.3, p < 0.001 and 95.9  4.2 % vs. 98.3  1.9 %, p = 0.040, respectively). We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) to evaluate their ability to predict RC. The AUCs of the IPI and SpO2 were 0.80 (0.69-0.91) and 0.64 (0.48-0.80), respectively. The IPI-SD, evaluating fluctuation, was significantly greater in the RC group than in the non-RC group (1.47  0.74 vs. 0.93  0.74, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that low value of the initial IPI and the fluctuating IPI after admission to the PACU predict the occurrence of RC. The IPI might be useful for respiratory monitoring in PACUs and ICUs after general anesthesia.","output":"Integrated pulmonary index can predict respiratory compromise in high-risk patients in the post-anesthesia care unit: a prospective, observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The quantity, identity, and distribution of biomass in indoor and outdoor aerosols are poorly described.

However, there is little information on the prevalence of loneliness among people with disability or the association between disability, loneliness and wellbeing. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: For a nationally representative sample of adults (age 16-64) with/without disability, to examine exposure to three indicators of low social connectedness (loneliness, low perceived social support, social isolation), and to evaluate the association between low social connectedness and wellbeing. To test whether disability status moderated the relationship between low social connectedness and wellbeing. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from three annual rounds of the cross-sectional English Community Life Survey (CLS) 2016-19. RESULTS: People with disability experienced loneliness, low perceived social support and social isolation at significantly higher rates than people without disability. Effect sizes were significantly greater for loneliness. Disability was associated with lower wellbeing. With one exception, low social connectedness was associated with lower wellbeing. Again, effect sizes were significantly greater for loneliness. The prevalence of loneliness was highest among adults with disability who were younger, economically inactive, living in rented or other accommodation, living alone and with low levels of access to environmental assets. There was no evidence that disability status moderated the association between exposure to low social connectedness and low wellbeing.

The psychological distress can linger after the initial recovery from the infection. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of provisional post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with cured COVID-2019. Methods: The baseline survey was conducted from 10 to 25 February 2020 in patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital. Demographic and clinical characteristics were acquired, and depression and anxiety levels were assessed, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, respectively. A follow-up survey was conducted 1 month post-discharge. PTSD symptoms were measured by the Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6) and patients perception of supportive care during hospitalization was investigated using a self-developed questionnaire. Results: In total, 114 patients completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys. Of these, 41 (36.0%) met the cut-off score for provisional PTSD diagnosis according to the IES-6. Female gender [odds ratio (OR) = 4.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54C14.37], educational level of high school or below (OR = 15.49, 95% CI 1.13C212.71), higher anxiety levels (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.12C1.61) and lower perceptions of emotional support during hospitalization (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.17C0.96) predicted a higher risk for provisional PTSD. Conclusions: PTSD is commonly seen in patients with COVID-19 1 month post-discharge. Female patients, and patients with lower educational levels, higher anxiety levels and lower perceptions of emotional support during hospitalization may be more likely to develop PTSD in the near future.

A specific type of interaction is that of location-based alerts, where mobile users subscribe to a service provider (SP) in order to be notified when a certain event occurs nearby. Consider, for instance, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where contact tracing has been singled out as an effective means to control the virus spread. Users wish to be notified if they came in proximity to an infected individual. However, serious privacy concerns arise if the users share their location history with the SP in plaintext. To address privacy, recent work proposed several protocols that can securely implement location-based alerts. The users upload their encrypted locations to the SP, and the evaluation of location predicates is done directly on ciphertexts. When a certain individual is reported as infected, all matching ciphertexts are found (e.g., according to a predicate such as \\"10 feet proximity to any of the locations visited by the infected patient in the last week\\"), and the corresponding users notified. However, there are significant performance issues associated with existing protocols. The underlying searchable encryption primitives required to perform the matching on ciphertexts are expensive, and without a proper encoding of locations and search predicates, the performance can degrade a lot. In this paper, we propose a novel method for variable-length location encoding based on Huffman codes. By controlling the length required to represent encrypted locations and the corresponding matching predicates, we are able to significantly speed up performance. We provide a theoretical analysis of the gain achieved by using Huffman codes, and we show through extensive experiments that the improvement compared with fixed-length encoding methods is substantial.","output":"An Efficient and Secure Location-based Alert Protocol using Searchable Encryption and Huffman Codes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Ageing affects homeostasis and immunosenescence, resulting in aberrant fever and immune responses to infection in older adults This study assesses heritability of basal temperature and explores effects of ageing on basal temperature and temperature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection Methods Observational study using multiple cohorts Participants: (a) Twin volunteers: 1089 healthy adults enrolled in Twins-UK, mean age 59 (17);tympanic temperature measurements;(b) Community-based: 3972 adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application, age 43 (13);self-reported test-positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection;self-reported temperature measurements;(c) Hospitalised: cohorts of 520 and 757 adult patients with emergency admission to two teaching hospitals between 01/03/2020C04/05/2020, age 62 (17) and 68 (17) respectively;RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection Analysis (a) heritability analysed using saturated and ACE univariate models;linear mixed-effect model for associations between basal temperature and age, sex and BMI (b&c) multivariable linear regression for associations between temperature and age, sex and BMI;multivariable logistic regression for associations between fever(&gt;/= 37 8C) and age, sex and BMI Results Basal temperature in twins demonstrated 50% heritability (95%CI[42C57%]) In healthy twin, community-based and hospitalised cohorts, increasing age is associated with lower temperatures, and increasing BMI with higher temperatures: (a) Twins (age:p &lt; 0 001;BMI:p = 0 002);(b) Community-based (age: p &lt; 0 001;BMI: p &lt; 0 001);(c) Hospitalised (1st hospital: age: p = 0 106;BMI: p = 0 033;2nd hospital: age: p &lt; 0 001;BMI: p = 0 010) Increasing age was negatively and BMI positively associated with fever (1st hospital: Age: OR = 0 99, p = 0 033;BMI: OR = 1 00, p = 0 045;2nd hospital: Age: OR = 0 99, p = 0 010;BMI: OR 1 02, p = 0 038) Conclusions Heritability of basal temperature suggests a genetic component to thermoregulation Associations observed between increasing age and lower temperatures and higher BMI and higher temperatures are important in understanding effects of ageing and obesity on basal temperature and the fever response In older adults, findings have important implications for defining fever thresholds and diagnosing infections, including SARS-CoV-2","output":"99 Heritability of Temperature and the Effects of Ageing on Temperature Regulation: An Observational Multi-Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated autophagy was involved in the process of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

In addition, significantly different ARGs were verified in EAC specimens and normal esophageal mucosal tissues. RESULTS: Thirty significantly different ARGs were selected from EAC and normal tissues. Functional enrichments showed these ARGs were mainly related apoptosis. Multivariate cox regression analyses demonstrated eight ARGs were significantly associated with OS. Among these eight genes, BECN1 (HR = 0.321, P = 0.046), DAPK1 (HR = 0.636, P = 0.025) and CAPN1 (HR = 0.395, P = 0.004) played protective roles in survival. Gender (HR = 0.225, P = 0.032), stage (HR = 5.841, P = 0.008) and risk score (HR = 1.131, P < 0.001) were independent prognostic risk factors. ROC curves showed better efficacy to predict survival using the risk score. Additionally, we found BECN1, DAPK1, VAMP7 and SIRT1 genes were correlated significantly with survival status, gender, primary tumor and tumor stage (all P < 0.05). The experimental results confirmed the BIRC5 was overexpressed and the ITPR1, PRKN were downregulated in the EAC tissues compared with the normal esophageal mucosal tissues (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that autophagy was involved in the process of EAC. Several ARGs probably could serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and may help facilitate therapeutic targets in EAC patients.","output":"Profiles of autophagy-related genes in esophageal adenocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate globally resulting in emergence of several variants of concern (VOC), including B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 that show increased transmissibility and enhanced resistance to antibody neutralization.

Here, we report quantitative reporters for Mpro function in living cells in which protease inhibition by genetic or chemical methods results in robust signal readouts by fluorescence (enhanced green fluorescent protein [eGFP]) or bioluminescence (firefly luciferase). These gain-of-signal systems are scalable to high-throughput platforms for quantitative discrimination between Mpro mutants and/or inhibitor potencies as evidenced by validation of several reported inhibitors. Additional utility is shown by single Mpro amino acid variants and structural information combining to demonstrate that both inhibitor conformational dynamics and amino acid differences are able to influence inhibitor potency. We further show that a recent variant of concern (Omicron) has an unchanged response to a clinically approved drug, nirmatrelvir, whereas proteases from divergent coronavirus species show differential susceptibility. Together, we demonstrate that these gain-of-signal systems serve as robust, facile, and scalable assays for live cell quantification of Mpro inhibition, which will help expedite the development of next-generation antivirals and enable the rapid testing of emerging variants. IMPORTANCE The main protease, Mpro, of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential viral protein required for the earliest steps of infection. It is therefore an attractive target for antiviral drug development. Here, we report the development and implementation of two complementary cell-based systems for quantification of Mpro inhibition by genetic or chemical approaches. The first is fluorescence based (eGFP), and the second is luminescence based (firefly luciferase). Importantly, both systems rely upon gain-of-signal readouts such that stronger inhibitors yield higher fluorescent or luminescent signal. The high versatility and utility of these systems are demonstrated by characterizing Mpro mutants and natural variants, including Omicron, as well as a panel of existing inhibitors. These systems rapidly, safely, and sensitively identify Mpro variants with altered susceptibilities to inhibition, triage-nonspecific, or off-target molecules and validate bona fide inhibitors, with the most potent thus far being the first-in-class drug nirmatrelvir.","output":"Gain-of-Signal Assays for Probing Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro/3CLpro in Living Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, with the rapid advancement and consumerization of virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and extended reality (XR) technology, the use of XR technology in spine medicine has also become increasingly popular.

Limited data exist regarding its effectiveness when used in real-world clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: This study examined ATII as a third-line vasopressor based on institutional approval. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medical ICU at an academic tertiary care medical center. Adult patients requiring 3 or more vasopressor agents for septic shock or other forms of distributed shock from September 1, 2018, to January 31, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effect of ATII after norepinephrine and vasopressin on mortality and mean arterial blood pressure response after 3 hours of administration. RESULTS: One-hundred forty-seven patients, 56 receiving ATII and 91 receiving another vasopressor (non-ATII), were enrolled. Patients in the ATII group had higher mortality compared to the non-ATII group, and more required 5 or greater vasopressor agents (p < 0.01). After propensity score weighting, there remains a trend in higher mortality in the ATII compared to non-ATII group, but not statistically significant (86.0% vs 71.0%, p = 0.16). More patients in the ATII group continued to require 5 or greater vasopressor agents compared to the non-ATII group after propensity score weighting (45.9% vs 12.5%, p < 0.01). SOFA score was the only variable associated with mortality (OR = 1.25, 95% CI, 1.05C1.49; p = 0.01).

In addition, the mortality rate is exceedingly high among COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. The purpose of this study is to examine the differences between survivors and non-survivors of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Method This multicenter retrospective observational study was conducted at two hospitals in Southern California, USA. First, we compared the characteristics of the ICU patients that died and those that survived using the chi-square test for categorical variables and t-test for the continuous variables, with a p-value of 0.05 considered significant. Finally, we did a backward selection Cox multivariate regression analysis using mortality as a dependent variable. Result There were 1,116 patients admitted with COVID-19 during our study period. Of this number, 238 (21.3%) were admitted to the ICU. Among patients admitted to the ICU, 195 (81.9%) died and 43 (18.1%) survived. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, C-reactive protein (CRP) (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.003-1.059), tachycardia (HR 3.51, 95% CI 1.83-6.72), and age (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04) were independently associated with mortality. Patients BMI and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease did not predict mortality. Conclusion Age, elevated CRP, and tachycardia were independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. It appears that several factors that predict severe diseases in COVID-19 patients, such as BMI and comorbidities, become less important once patients are admitted to the ICU.","output":"Predictors of COVID-19 Mortality in Critically Ill ICU Patients: A Multicenter Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in the elderly throughout the industrialized world.

We sampled and tested wildlife in the central African country Cameroon to determine which CoVs are circulating and how they relate to previously detected human and animal CoVs. We collected animal and ecological data at sampling locations and used family-level consensus PCR combined with amplicon sequencing for virus detection. Between 2003 and 2018, samples were collected from 6,580 animals of several different orders. CoV RNA was detected in 175 bats, a civet, and a shrew. The CoV RNAs detected in the bats represented 17 different genetic clusters, coinciding with alpha (n=8) and beta (n=9) CoVs. Sequences resembling human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) were found in 40 Hipposideridae bats. Phylogenetic analyses place the human derived HCoV-229E isolates closest to those from camels in terms of the S and N genes, but closest to isolates from bats for the E, M, and RdRp genes. The CoV RNA positivity rate in bats varied significantly (p<0.001) between the wet (8.2%) and dry season (4.5%). Most sampled species accordingly had a wet season high and dry season low, while for some the opposite was found. Eight of the suspected CoV species of which we detected RNA appear to be entirely novel CoV species, which suggests that CoV diversity in African wildlife is still rather poorly understood. The detection of multiple different variants of HCoV-229E-like viruses supports the bat reservoir hypothesis for this virus, with the phylogenetic results casting some doubt on camels as an intermediate host. The findings also support the previously proposed influence of ecological factors on CoV circulation, indicating a high level of underlying complexity to the viral ecology. These results indicate the importance of investing in surveillance activities among wild animals to detect all potential threats as well as sentinel surveillance among exposed humans to determine emerging threats.","output":"Wildlife in Cameroon harbor diverse coronaviruses including many isolates closely related to human coronavirus 229E"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the registration characteristics of registered clinical research, and find the potential scientific and feasibility problems of clinical research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), providing reference for the good management of follow-up research registration.

Covariates included demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race-ethnicity, political ideology), general beliefs (e.g., benefits of vaccines, altruistic attitudes), and COVID-19 health beliefs and experiences (COVID-19 worry and severity, perception of COVID-19 as a community threat, knowing someone with COVID-19). For each group, hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was conducted with intent to vaccinate as the outcome. Results Among participants (n=3,502), 47% did not receive influenza vaccine in the prior 12 months and 53% had; 25.5% of non-vaccinators and 91.9% of vaccinators intended future vaccination. For non-vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with race/ethnicity (Hispanics were more likely to intend than white-NH; AOR=1.74; 95%CI=1.23-2.4), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR=2.19;95%CI=1.88-2.54), and perception of COVID-19 as a community threat (AOR=1.91;95%CI=1.49-2.45). For vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with age (AOR=1.04;95%CI=1.03-1.05), race/ethnicity (Black-NH and Other-NH were less likely to intend than white-NH, AOR=.60;95%CI=.36-.999; and AOR=.45;95%CI=.24-.84, respectively), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR=1.88;95%CI=1.45-2.45) and greater perception of collective benefits of vaccines (AOR=1.48;95%CI=1.15-1.90). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic may have served as a cue to action for influenza vaccination intention among some prior non-vaccinators whereas intention among prior vaccinators is more related to positive attitudes toward vaccination.","output":"Influenza Vaccination in the Time of COVID-19: A National U.S. Survey of Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder with wide systemic involvement including pigment deposition.

This study aimed to identify correlated factors for depression/anxiety among children and adolescents after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: An online survey by cluster sampling was conducted after lockdown in 5175 Chinese children and adolescents with informed consents from their parents. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scales with 10-point cutoff were used to measure depression and anxiety, separately. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted. Stata 15.1 Version was used. RESULTS: 12.33% and 6.26% of all participants reported depression and anxiety after lockdown, separately. Suicidal ideation, quarreling with parents, insomnia, difficulty in concentrating during online learning, and anxious and depressed mood during lockdown were positively associated with depression and anxiety after lockdown. Missing teachers was negatively associated with both depression and anxiety. Living in urban and not living with parents were positively associated with depression. LIMITATIONS: The past history and familial history of mental disorders have not been collected. The recall biases for collecting self-reporting information might exist, and the causal inferences cannot be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents might decline a bit after lockdown but is still at a high level after lockdown.

The anti-nociceptive effects of indigo were assessed through acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate test, and formalin test, and spontaneous locomotor activity and motor performance were evaluated. The mechanisms of activities of indigo were explored by evaluating the expression levels of IB kinase (IKK), p-IKK, inhibitor B (IB), p-IB, p65 nuclear factor (NF)-kB, p-p65 NF-B, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) through western blotting and the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that indigo significantly reduced xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, and acetic acid-induced vascular permeation. In addition, indigo significantly inhibited nociception induced by acetic acid and formalin. However, the level of nociception was not decreased by indigo in the hot plate test, and indigo did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity and motor performance.

Although there is a few tools that gauge the patients' perception about their experiences, none of them are contextualized to an emergency in the Middle East and North Africa region. Accordingly, this study aims at developing and validating a tool to address this gap, and deploying it to assess the patients' perception of telehealth services during COVID-19 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: A convergent mixed methods design was adapted. A random selection of 100 patients from Dubai, UAE were invited to participate. Qualitative and quantitative datasets were collected using a tailor-made survey. The qualitative data, collected through open-ended questions, was analyzed using multi-staged thematic analysis. As for the quantitative data, it captured the patients' extent of satisfaction, and was assessed using SPSS (with a series of descriptive and inferential analyses). The qualitative and quantitative findings were then merged via joint display analysis. Results: Out of the 100 patients that were randomly selected, 94 patients participated in this study. The reliability score of Cronbach's Alpha for the instrument was 98.9%. The percentage of the total average of satisfaction was 80.67%. The Principal Component Analysis showed that 88.1% of the variance can be explained by the instrument (p < 0.001). The qualitative data analysis expanded upon the quantitative findings enabling a better understanding of the patients' perception. Three themes, revolving around the quality of the patient telehealth experiences, surfaced: Factors that worked to the benefit of the patients, Factors that the patients were not in favor of, and Opportunities for improvements as perceived by the patients. Discussion: This study introduced a novel patient satisfaction with telehealth consultation survey contextualized to the COVID-19 times in Dubai, UAE. The participants were quite satisfied with the quality of their experience, however they suggested areas for improvement. Regional healthcare decision-makers can leverage the identified advantages and opportunities for improvement of telehealth. This will enable making informed decisions regarding the continuity of telehealth irrespective of how matters unfold in relation to the pandemic. It will also better prepare the healthcare sector for potential resurgence(s) of COVID-19 and/or the occurrence of other similar emergencies.","output":"Telehealth to the Rescue During COVID-19: A Convergent Mixed Methods Study Investigating Patients' Perception"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spurred by the severe restrictions on mobility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is currently intense interest in developing the Metaverse, to offer virtual services/business online.

To address this, the psychobiotic strain Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025 was investigated for its genomic features, metabolic features, and gut microbial and metabolic modulation effect. METHODS AND RESULTS: Unlike Bifidobacterium breve FHLJDQ3M5, CCFM1025 significantly decreased the chronically stressed mice's depressive-like behaviors and neurological abnormalities. CCFM1025 has more genes encoding glycoside hydrolases when comparing to FHLJDQ3M5's genome, which means CCFM1025 has a superior carbohydrate utilization capacity and living adaptivity in the gut. CCFM1025 also produced higher levels of neuromodulatory metabolites, including hypoxanthine, tryptophan, and nicotinate. The administration of CCFM1025 reshaped the gut microbiome of chronically stressed mice. It resulted in higher cecal xanthine, tryptophan, short-chain fatty acid levels, and enhanced fatty acid and tryptophan biosynthesis capability in the gut-brain interaction (identified by in silico analyses) than FHLJDQ3M5-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic and metabolic features involving glycoside hydrolases and neuromodulatory metabolites may determine the antidepressant-like effect of Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025.

In this context, the Physiology-Based Model (PBM), a neural mass model, is used as a generative model. However, previous studies have highlighted out the inability of PBM to properly describe iEEG signals with specific power spectral densities (PSDs). More precisely, PSDs that have multiple peaks around  and  rhythms (i.e. spectral characteristics at seizure onset) are concerned. METHODS To cope with this limitation, an alternative neural mass model, called the complete PBM (cPBM), is investigated. The spectral DCM and two recent variants are used to evaluate the relevance of cPBM over PBM. RESULTS The study is conducted on both simulated signals and real epileptic iEEG recordings. Our results confirm that, compared to PBM, cPBM shows (i) more ability to model the desired PSDs and (ii) lower numerical complexity whatever the method. CONCLUSIONS Thanks to its intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity parameters as well as the input coming into the fast inhibitory subpopulation, the cPBM provides a more expressive model of PSDs, leading to a better understanding of epileptic patterns and DCM-based effective connectivity inference.","output":"Investigation of two neural mass models for DCM-based effective connectivity inference in temporal epilepsy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women and its incidence has been increasing over the years. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 or ErbB2) overexpression is responsible for 20 to 25% of invasive breast cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis. HER2-targeted therapy has significantly improved overall survival rates in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. However, despite the benefits of this therapy, its cardiotoxicity is a major concern, especially when HER2-targeted therapy is used in conjunction with anthracyclines. At present, the mechanism of this cardiotoxicity is not fully understood. It is thought that HER2-targeting drugs inhibit HER2/NRG 1 dimer formation, causing an increase in ROS in the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes and inhibiting the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways, resulting in cell apoptosis. Antioxidants, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, -blockers, statins and other drugs may have a cardioprotective effect when used with ErbB2-targeting drugs. NT-proBNP can be used to monitor trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity during HER2-targeted treatment and may serve as a biological marker for clinical prediction of cardiotoxicity. Measuring NT-proBNP is non-invasive, inexpensive and reproducible, therefore is worthy of the attention of clinicians.

To understand this better, an 18-item online survey was disseminated by the Worldwide Network for Blood & Marrow Transplantation with questions exploring SARS-CoV-2 testing algorithms, mobilization, and cryopreservation strategies and COVID-19 infections in allogeneic related and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) donors. The aim of this survey was to assess the impact of the outbreak on policies relating to HPC mobilization, collection, and processing with respect to changes in daily routine. A total of 91 individual responses from distinct centers in 6 continents were available for analysis. In these centers, the majority (72%) of allogeneic related and autologous donors are routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 before HPC collection, and 80% of centers implement cryopreservation of allogeneic HPC grafts before commencing conditioning regimens in patients. Five related and 14 autologous donors who tested positive for COVID-19 did not experience any unexpected adverse events or reactions during growth factor administration (eg, hyperinflammatory syndrome). These data are limited by the small number of survey respondents but nonetheless suggest that centers are following the recommendations of appropriate scientific organizations and provide some preliminary data to suggest areas of further study.","output":"Changes in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Practices in Response to COVID-19: A Survey from the Worldwide Network for Blood & Marrow Transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute suppurative bacterial dacryoadenitis (ASBD) was not reported to occur following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Methods: The incidence data of COVID-19 reported in Shaanxi as of 22 February, 2020 were collected for an epidemiological descriptive analysis. Results: A total of 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Shaanxi. Most cases were mild (87.76%). As time passed, the areas where confirmed cases were reported continued to increase. The case number in Xi'an was highest, accounting for nearly half of the total reported cases in the province. The epidemic pattern in Shaanxi had gradually shifted from imported case pattern to local case pattern, and the transmission of local cases was mainly based on family cluster transmission. The confirmed cases from different sources had caused the secondary transmission in Shaanxi. After February 7, the number of reported cases began to fluctuate and decrease stably, indicating a decrease-to-zero period. Conclusions: At present, the overall epidemic of COVID-19 in Shaanxi has gradually been mitigated.

Pain character were evaluated using the Pain Quality Assessment Scale. Laboratory parameters were checked for all patients. The correlation between clinical and laboratory parameters was examined. Results: The sample consisted of 70 (42.9%) females and 93 (57.1%) males. The prevalence of muscle-joint pain was 63.2% (n=103). The most common pains were back pain (n=52, 50.5%). The pain was mostly temporary, intense, and dull. It spread locally to sensitive surrounding areas. Patients with muscle-joint pain were found to have a higher prevalence and severity of disease anxiety (p <0.05).

All the three models with default settings exhibited distinct errors in the simulated vertical temperature profile. Then model calibration was conducted by adjusting three (four) key parameters within FLake and CoLM-Lake (WRF-Lake) in a series of sensitive experiments. Results showed that each model's performance is sensitive to the key parameters and becomes much better when adjusting all the key parameters relative to tuning single parameter. Overall, setting the temperature of maximum water density to 1.1 C instead of 4 C in the three models consistently leads to improved vertical thermal structure simulation during cold seasons; reducing the light extinction coefficient in FLake results in much deeper mixed layer and warmer thermocline during warm seasons in better agreement with the observation. The vertical thermal structure can be clearly improved by decreasing the light extinction coefficient and increasing the turbulent mixing in WRF-Lake and CoLM-Lake during warm seasons. Meanwhile, the modeled water temperature profile in warm seasons can be significantly improved by further replacing the constant surface roughness lengths by a parameterized scheme in WRF-Lake. Further intercomparison indicates that among the three calibrated models, FLake (WRF-Lake) performs the best to simulate the temporal evolution and intensity of temperature in the layers shallower (deeper) than 10 m, while WRF-Lake is the best at simulating the amplitude and pattern of the temperature variability at all depths.","output":"Evaluating and Improving the Performance of Three 1-D Lake Models in a Large Deep Lake of the Central Tibetan Plateau."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease with multiple etiologies, while smoking is the most established one.

Lung tissues were obtained from lung cancer patients with or without COPD who underwent lobotomy and the levels of miR-21, TGF-?/Smad signaling molecules, ROR?3T, and other Th17-related cytokines were detected. Mouse COPD models were built by exposing both wild-type (WT) and miR-21-/- mice to cigarette smoke (CS) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) intraperitoneal injection. Isolated primary CD4+ T cells were treated with either CS extract, miR-21 mimics or inhibitors, followed by measuring Th17 cells markers and the expression of TGF-?/Smad signaling molecules and ROR?3T. Increased levels of miR-21, Smad7, phosphorylated (p)-Smad2, p-Smad3, TGF-?, and Th17-related cytokines was detected in the lungs of COPD patients. Lung function in modeled WT mice, but not miR-21-/- ones, deteriorated and the number of inflammatory cells in the lung tissues increased compared to the control WT-mice. Moreover, primary CD4+ lymphocytes tend to differentiate into Th17 cells after the treatment with CSE or miR-21 mimics, and the expression of ROR?3T and the TGF-?/Smad signaling were all increased, however miR-21 inhibitors worked reversely.

ADAP2 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arf6 and binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P(3)) and PI(3,4)P(2).

Utilizing two techniqueslight-sensitive neutral red (NR)-containing DENV and fluorescence assays for virus internalizationwe show that ADAP2 primarily restricts DENV infection at the stage of virion entry and/or intracellular trafficking and that incoming DENV and VSV particles associate with ADAP2 during their entry.

The early chest CT manifestations were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS The interstitial changes with ground glass density shadow (GGO) were similar in two groups during first chest CT examination (P>0.05). There were more lung lobes involved on the first chest CT in COVID-19 patients, which were mostly distributed in the dorsal outer zone (23/26, 88.5%), and nearly half of them (12/26, 46.2%) were accompanied by crazy-paving sign; while the lesions in adult mycoplasma pneumonia patients were mostly distributed along the bronchi, and the bronchial wall was thickened (19/21, 90.5%), accompanied with tree buds / fog signs (19/21, 90.5%). The above CT signs were significantly different between the two kinds of pneumonia (all P<0.01).

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a search of the English literature for published prospective controlled trials comparing surgical clipping with endovascular coil embolization for ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Data were abstracted from the identified references. Outcomes of interest were the proportion of patients with a poor outcome at 1 year and episodes of rebleeding from the index treated aneurysm after the allocated treatment. RESULTS There were 3 prospective controlled trials eligible for inclusion. These studies enrolled 2723 patients. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that the rate of poor outcome at 1 year was significantly lower in patients allocated to coil embolization (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.87). This relative effect is consistent with an absolute risk reduction of 7.8% and a number needed to treat of 13. The effect on mortality was not statistically different across the 2 treatments. Rebleeding rates within the first month were higher in patients allocated to endovascular coil embolization.

First, the terms sustainability and sustainment are often falsely conflated: sustainability assesses the likelihood of an EBP being in use in the future while sustainment assesses the extent to which an EBP is (or is not) in use. Second, grant funding often ends before sustainment can be assessed. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Diffusion of Excellence (DoE) is one of few large-scale models of diffusion;it seeks to identify and disseminate practices across the VHA system. The DoE sponsors Shark Tank competitions, in which leaders bid on the opportunity to implement a practice with 6 months of implementation support. As part of an ongoing evaluation of the DoE, we sought to develop and administer a pragmatic instrument to assess sustainment of DoE practices.Methods In June 2020, surveys were sent to 64 facilities that were part of the DoE evaluation. We began analysis by comparing alignment of quantitative and qualitative responses;some facility representatives reported in the open text box of the survey that their practice was on a temporary hold due to COVID-19 but answered the primary outcome question differently. As a result, the team reclassified the primary outcome of these facilities to Sustained: Temporary COVID-Hold. Following this reclassification, the number and percent of facilities in each category was calculated. We used directed content analysis, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), to analyze open text box responses. Results A representative from forty-one facilities (64%) completed the survey. Among responding facilities, 29/41 sustained their practice, 1/41 partially sustained their practice, 8/41 had not sustained their practice, and 3/41 had never implemented their practice. Sustainment rates increased between Cohorts 1 C 4. Conclusions The development and administration of our pragmatic survey allowed us to assess sustainment of DoE practices. Planned updates to the survey will enable flexibility in assessing sustainment and its determinants at any phase after adoption.

To continue to support people with breast cancer, the charity has expanded its provision of telephone, and online individual and group therapy sessions via Zoom. The aim of the service evaluation was to explore the effect of the pandemic on the emotional and physical health/medical treatment of BCH users, and the use and helpfulness of telephone and online support services. Methods: A link to a short online survey was emailed out during 20th May to 4th June 2020 to 4,261 breast cancer survivors who were past or current BCH users. Frequency analyses of pooled responses to Yes/No questions were downloaded from the SurveyMonkey website. Individual free text responses were analysed by coding into common themes, clustered into categories. Results: A total of 382 people completed the survey (8.9% response rate). 76 (19.9%) stated that they had not needed to use the on-line support services and were removed from the analysis. Emotional health (71.4%) and to a lesser extent, physical health/medical treatment (54.1%) were perceived to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 44.1% felt that BCH helped them cope now, and 84.4% wanted BCH to expand its online services in the following areas: one-to-one therapies e.g. counselling, group therapies e.g. yoga, pilates, support groups, classes/courses, advice and emotional support.

Temporality of injury is an important factor but is not specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury. Several insults hit the kidney at different moments in the course of disease, some occurring prior to hospital admission, whereas others take place at various stages during hospitalization.

The numerous mechanisms involved do not occur simultaneously, leading to a multiple hit model that may contribute to the prevalence and severity of acute kidney injury. A personalized approach to each patient with acute kidney injury based on the timing and severity of disease is necessary in order to provide appropriate treatment.

Predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) not only highlights a patient-tailored approach by choosing the right medication, the right dose at the right time point but it as well essentially requires early identification, by the means of complex and state-of-the-art technologies of unmanifested pathological processes in an individual, in order to deliver targeted prevention early enough to reverse manifestation of a pathology. Such an approach can be achieved by taking into account clinical, pathological, environmental, and psychosocial characteristics of the patients or an individual who has a suboptimal health condition.

Therefore, it is the common goal of PPPM and translational medicine to find the solution for the problem we present in our review. Both, translational medicine and PPPM in parallel, essentially need accurate surrogates for misleading animal models. This study was therefore undertaken to provide shreds of evidence against the validity of animal models.

The objective of this review was to investigate the field of otolaryngologys virtual adaptations to medical education, residency interviews, telemedicine, and provider wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A search was conducted using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases in May of 2021. Two hundred nine (n=209) texts were retrieved, and seventy three (n=73) articles were deemed eligible for full-text review. Forty-seven (n=47) studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Selected articles emphasized: 1) tailoring medical education in otolaryngology to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) provider and patient impact of telehealth in otolaryngology, and 3) adaptations made by residency programs for recruitment and placement. Results: Findings demonstrate that medical students successfully adapted to virtual interviews, alternative education in otolaryngology, and innovative means of networking with programs through social media. Studies assessed suggested residents positively adapted to alternate virtual experiences of patient care including virtual surgeries, synchronous didactic sessions, and telemedicine. For otolaryngology providers and residents, the widespread and rapid implementation of telemedicine led to increased stress and burnout but improved throughout the duration of the ongoing pandemic. Conclusion: Measures put in place to prioritize safety through telemedicine, virtual medical education, and alternative experiences to training have allowed the field of otolaryngology to successfully adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To assess the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on mortality, we aimed to estimate excess mortality in Thailand. MethodsWe estimated the baseline number of deaths in the absence of COVID-19 using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). The models were adjusted for seasonality and demographics. We evaluated the excess mortality from April to October 2021 in Thailand. ResultsWe found that the estimated cumulative excess death from April to October 2021 was 14.3% (95% CI: 8.6%-18.8%) higher than the baseline. The results also showed that the excess deaths in males were higher than in females by approximately 26.3%. The excess deaths directly caused by the COVID-19 infections accounted for approximately 75.0% of the all-cause excess deaths. Furthermore, the cumulative COVID-19 cases were found to be correlated with the cumulative excess deaths with a correlation coefficient of 0.9912 (95% CI, 0.9392-0.9987). ConclusionsThe recent COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand significantly impacts mortality and affects people for specific ages and sex.

WMDA activities include recording the number of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donations globally. Because the COVID-19 pandemic also has an impact on the treatment of patients with other diseases, we hypothesise that it also impacted the practice of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We used the 2020 WMDA data to examine the trends in unrelated HSC donations during the COVID-19 pandemic globally, per continent and per country/region. Methods: Donor registries (DRs) and cord blood banks (CBBs) from 61 countries participated in the 2020 survey, compared to 59 countries in the 2019. Slight differences in participation between the data sets of 2019 and 2020 do not explain the trends we observe in HSC donations. Country/region-specific COVID-19 data on cases and deaths were obtained from the data repository operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering(https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19, accessed July 12, 2021);and population data were retrieved from the Worldometer website(https://www.worldometers.info/, accessed July 12, 2021). Results: HSC donations from unrelated donors (peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and bone marrow (BM)) decreased from 20,330 in 2019 to 19,623 in 2020 (-3.5%), compared to an average annual growth rate of 3.9% from 2015 to 2019 (figure 1). The 3.5% decrease is composed of a 29.0% decrease for BM and a 2.6% increase for PBSC, resulting in a drop in the BM share of unrelated HSC donations from 19.3% in 2019 to 14.2% in 2020. The number of cord blood unit (CBU) shipments globally decreased with 3.5% from 2,851 to 2,750. The percentage of national use of HSC products (PBSC and BM) increased from 51.2% to 53.5%. When considering the continent on which the patient is transplanted (table 1), the change rate of use of HSC donated products in 2020 vs. 2019 ranged from -28.0% in South America to +18.2% in Africa. In absolute numbers, the largest decrease of HSC donations occurred for patients in Asia (n=-485) followed by Europe (n=-205), and the largest increase occurred in North America (n=+88) followed by Oceania (n=+25). The share of HSC donations requiring intercontinental transport decreased from 24.6% in 2019 to 21.9% in 2020. In terms of the country/region of transplant (table 2), the largest percentage decrease occurred in Colombia (-90,5%) followed by Russia (-55,5%). In absolute numbers, the largest decrease occurred in Turkey (-147), with Japan following (-128, although Japan saw an increase of CBU use of +106). The highest growth rate was observed in Iran (+28,7%), followed by South Africa (+28,2%). In absolute figures, the greatest increase occurred in Italy (+67). The two countries receiving the largest HSC donation numbers showed no major changes versus the previous year: USA: +0.6% (although a decrease for CBU of -21,0% was observed) and Germany: -2.4%. We did not find any significant correlation between the numbers of COVID-19 cases or COVID-19-related deaths per 1 million inhabitants with the HSC donation numbers (Spearman's r=0.05 for cases and =0.08 for deaths). Discussion: The decline in the number of unrelated HSC donations in 2020 suggests an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HSC donation and unrelated HSCT. The significant decrease in BM collections and intercontinental/cross-border shipments can be explained by logistically complex processes, as well the increased risk to the donor of being exposed to an operative procedure. CBU as a stem cell source potentially circumvents these logistical complications. However, on a global scale our data does not show increased use of CBU suggesting that decisions to use CBU as a stem cell source did not change in the pandemic. We were unable to demonstrate a correlation between country/region-specific severity of the pandemic and HSC donation numbers. We suspect this is due to the data quality of reported number of COVID-1 cases and COVID-19-related deaths. Also, we did not gather monthly data and therefore could not specify pandemic waves. In conclusion, we would like to point out the fact that global exchanges of HSC products continued and only decreased slightly is an extraordinary achievement of DRs, CBBs and their donors and is a testament to the importance of international collaborations in the WMDA.

Identifying features utilizing multiple imaging modalities engenders a clearer picture of the illness's long-term consequences. AREAS COVERED: This review encompasses the common pulmonary findings associated with different imaging modalities during acute and late remission stages of COVID-19 pneumonia. EXPERT OPINION: Chest x-ray, a common preliminary diagnostic imaging technique, is not optimal for extended care due to limited tissue contrast resolution providing suboptimal assessment of pulmonary pathology and subtle interval changes. Ultrasound may be utilized on a case-by-case basis in certain patient populations, or in countries with limited resources. Chest CT's accessibility, high tissue contrast and spatial resolution make it the foremost modality for long-term COVID-19 follow-up. While MRI can viably monitor extrapulmonary disease due to its lack of radiation and high inherent soft-tissue contrast, it has limited pulmonary utility due to motion artifact and alveolar gas decreasing lung signal. Although 18F-FDG-PET/CT is costly and has limited specificity, it can provide molecular level data and inflammation quantification. Lung perfusion scintigraphy may also explain COVID-19 induced thromboembolic events and persistent dyspnea despite normal structural imaging and testing results. Correlating the long-term pulmonary findings of COVID-19 with each imaging modality is essential in elucidating the post-recovery course.","output":"The role of imaging techniques in understanding and evaluating the long-term pulmonary effects of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on system justification theory suggests that justifying the societal status quo decreases negative emotions, leading to less collective action. In this investigation, we propose that the degree to which negative emotions mediate the link between system justification and collective action may depend upon whether individuals tend to suppress the expression of their negative emotions. We tested this hypothesis in the diverse socio-political contexts of Turkey, Israel, and the U.S. In one correlational study (Study 1) and three experimental studies (Studies 2C4), we observed that the link between system justification and willingness to participate in collective action through anger (Studies 1C2 and 4) and guilt (Study 3) was moderated by expressive suppression. We found that negative emotions mediated the association between system justification and collective action among those who suppress the expression of their emotions less frequently, but not those who use expressive suppression more frequently. These findings suggest that emotion regulation may undermine, rather than facilitate, efforts to engage in collective action even among people who are low in system justification.

However, whether its effectiveness persists in the long term is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a follow-up program by conducting a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compares augmented MBCT with follow-up sessions and that without follow-up sessions in preparation for a definitive RCT. METHODS: The study involves an 8-week MBCT with a 10-month follow-up. Patients aged 20 to 65 years who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for panic disorder, agoraphobia, or social anxiety disorder, which is not remitted with usual treatment for at least 4 weeks, will be included in the study and randomly allocated to receive augmented MBCT with follow-up sessions or augmented MBCT without follow-up sessions. For this feasibility RCT, the primary outcomes are (1) study inclusion rate, (2) dropout rate, (3) attendance rate, and (4) mean and standard deviation of several clinical measures at 8 weeks and 5, 8, and 12 months. RESULTS: We started recruiting participants in January 2020, and 43 participants have been enrolled up to January 2021. The study is ongoing, and data collection will be completed by May 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study is novel in terms of its design, which compares augmented MBCT with and without follow-up sessions. The limitations of the trial are as follows: (1) mixed participants in terms of the delivery mode of the intervention, and (2) lack of a pharmacotherapy-alone arm.

DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional design, we performed shotgun next-generation sequencing on stool samples to evaluate gut microbiome composition and diversity in both patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed infections, which had presented to Ventura Clinical Trials for care from March 2020 through October 2021 and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative exposed controls. Patients were classified as being asymptomatic or having mild, moderate or severe symptoms based on National Institute of Health criteria. Exposed controls were individuals with prolonged or repeated close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or their samples, for example, household members of patients or frontline healthcare workers. Microbiome diversity and composition were compared between patients and exposed controls at all taxonomic levels. RESULTS: Compared with controls (n=20), severely symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (n=28) had significantly less bacterial diversity (Shannon Index, p=0.0499; Simpson Index, p=0.0581), and positive patients overall had lower relative abundances of Bifidobacterium (p<0.0001), Faecalibacterium (p=0.0077) and Roseburium (p=0.0327), while having increased Bacteroides (p=0.0075). Interestingly, there was an inverse association between disease severity and abundance of the same bacteria. CONCLUSION: We hypothesise that low bacterial diversity and depletion of Bifidobacterium genera either before or after infection led to reduced proimmune function, thereby allowing SARS-CoV-2 infection to become symptomatic. This particular dysbiosis pattern may be a susceptibility marker for symptomatic severity from SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be amenable to preinfection, intrainfection or postinfection intervention.

We performed a service evaluation project in NHS Lothian to explore how and why the COVID-19 pandemic and public health advice had affected chest pain presentations and help-seeking behaviour at an individual patient level using a qualitative interview approach. METHODS: We carried out 28 semi-structured telephone interviews with a convenience sample of patients who presented with chest pain during lockdown and in patients with known coronary heart disease under the outpatient care of a cardiologist in April and May 2020. Interviews were audio recorded and voice files listened to while making detailed notes. Salient themes and issues were documented as verbatim extracts. Interviews were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Patient interviews revealed three main themes. 1) pandemic help-seeking behaviour; describing how participants made the decision to seek professional healthcare assessment. 2) COVID-19 exposure concerns; describing how the subthemes of perceived vulnerability, wishing to protect others and adding pressure to the health service shaped their decision making for an episode of acute chest pain. 3) hospital experience; describing the difference between the imagined and actual experience in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative interviews revealed how the pandemic shaped help-seeking practices, how patients interpreted their personal vulnerability to the virus, and described patient experience of attending hospital for assessment during this time.

This study aimed to assess whether the surgeon's experience has an effect on 1-year symptom scores and patient satisfaction. METHODS All the patients who underwent antireflux surgery were entered into a prospectively maintained database including 1-year postoperative symptom scores. The database was queried in June 2008 to identify patients who had been followed up for 1 year. To decrease variability, the patients with a large hiatal hernia (>5 cm), paraesophageal hernia, treatment with partial fundoplication, a required Collis gastroplasty, or treatment with a transthoracic procedure were excluded from the study. RESULTS From September 2003 to March 2007, 215 consecutive patients underwent primary antireflux surgery. Of these 215 patients, 158 (93 women with a mean age of 50.9  13.6 years; range, 18-87 years) met the inclusion criteria and were divided into three groups: early group (9/2003-10/2004), mid group (10/2004-12/2005), and late group (12/2005-3/2007). Experience significantly decreased the mean operative time (P < 0.05) and the hospital stay (P < 0.05). Additionally, the number of patients who required reoperative intervention also decreased with experience.

Here, we used the online SARS-CoV-2 databases, Nextstrain and Ourworld, to map the evolution and epidemiology of the virus. We identified 30 high entropy residues which underwent a progressive evolution to arrive at the current dominant variant - Delta variant. The virus underwent mutational waves with the first wave made up of structural proteins important in its infectivity and the second wave made up of the ORFs important for its contagion. The most important driver of the second wave is ORF8 mutations at residue 119 and 120. Further mutations of these two residues are creating new clades that are offshoots from the Delta backbone. More importantly the further expansion of the S protein in the Omicron variant is now followed with the acquisition of ORF8 mutations 119 and 120. These findings demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 mutates and points to two evolutionary paths; 1) Mutational expansion on the Delta backbone among the ORFs and 2) Mutational expansion of the S protein on other backbone follow with mutational wave among the ORFs.

The porcine airway epithelium contains binding sites for both swine/human IAV (2,6-linked sialic acids) and avian IAV (2,3-linked sialic acids) and therefore is suited for adaptation of viruses from other species as suggested by the mixing vessel theory. Here, we applied well-differentiated swine airway epithelial cells to find out whether efficient infection by avian IAV requires prior adaption. Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of the sialic acid-binding activity and the virus-induced detrimental effects. Surprisingly, an avian IAV H1N1 strain circulating in European poultry and waterfowl shows increased and prolonged viral replication without inducing a strong innate immune response. This virus could infect the lower respiratory tract in our precision cut-lung slice model. Pretreating the cells with poly (I:C) and/or JAK/STAT pathway inhibitors revealed that the interferon-stimulated innate immune response influences the replication of avian IAV in swine airway epitheliums but not that of swine IAV. Further studies indicated that in the infection by IAVs, the binding affinity of sialic acid is not the sole factor affecting the virus infectivity for swine or human airway epithelial cells, whereas it may be crucial in well-differentiated ferret tracheal epithelial cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the role of pigs being the vessel of interspecies transmission should be reconsidered, and the potential of avian H1N1 viruses to infect mammals needs to be characterized in more detail.","output":"Avian Influenza A Virus Infects Swine Airway Epithelial Cells without Prior Adaptation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Der Beitrag setzt sich mit der Frage auseinander, was den gesellschaftlichen Reaktionen auf die Ausbreitung des Coronavirus zu Grunde liegt In einer sozialwissenschaftlichen Perspektive wird argumentiert, dass diese nicht zureichend als zwangsl?ufige politische Konsequenz aus Einsichten der medizinischen Virenforschung verstanden werden k?nnen, sondern auch als Folge einer fundamentalen kulturellen Verunsicherung in den Blick zu nehmen sind Aufgezeigt wird zudem die nationalistische Rahmung der politischen Reaktionen Abschlie?end wird darauf auf die Gefahr hingewiesen, dass das, was in einem deklarierten tempor?ren Ausnahmezustand gesellschaftlich durchsetzbar ist, auch unter anderen Bedingungen aktualisiert werden k?nnte","output":"Corona-Krise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of depression has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To address this problem, we developed and characterized a novel approach for the rapid screening of ligands by using immobilized 5-HT(1A) receptor as the chromatographic stationary phase. Briefly, haloalkane dehalogenase was fused at the C-terminal of 5-HT(1A) receptor, and the modified 5-HT(1A) receptor was immobilized on amino-microspheres by the reaction between haloalkane dehalogenase and 6-chlorohexanoic acid linker.

Meta-population epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health and shaping policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intra-county environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different sub-regions. To address this issue, we develop a new human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behavior. This new modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and human mobility, business foot-traffic, race & ethnicity, and age-group are then investigated. The results reveal that in a college town (Dane County) the most important heterogeneity is spatial, while in a large city area (Milwaukee County) racial-ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent.

Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently utilized angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of 9 species to infect 293T cells. Similarly, pseudoviruses bearing S protein derived from either bat RaTG13 or pangolin GX, two closely related animal coronaviruses, utilized ACE2 of a diverse range of animal species to gain entry. The removal of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 S protein displayed distinct effects on pseudoviral entry into different cell types. Unexpectedly, the insertion of PRRA into the RaTG13 S protein selectively abrogated the usage of horseshoe bat and pangolin ACE2 but enhanced the usage of mouse ACE2 by the relevant pseudovirus to enter cells. Together, our findings identified a previously unrecognized effect of the PRRA insert on SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 S proteins. IMPORTANCE The four-residue insert (PRRA) at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 has been widely recognized since day 1 for its role in SARS-CoV-2 S protein processing and activation. As this PRRA insert is unique to SARS-CoV-2 among group b betacoronaviruses, it is thought to affect the tissue and species tropism of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the usages of 10 ACE2 orthologs and found that the presence of PRRA not only affects the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 but also modulates the usage of ACE2 orthologs by the closely related bat RaTG13 S protein. The binding of pseudovirions carrying RaTG13 S with a PRRA insert to mouse ACE2 was nearly 2-fold higher than that of pseudovirions carrying RaTG13 S.","output":"The PRRA Insert at the S1/S2 Site Modulates Cellular Tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 Usage by the Closely Related Bat RaTG13"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The collapse generated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Justice action, with the suspension of non-urgent judicial activity, postponing scheduled actions for the period of suspension, and the prevision of a huge number of new cases caused by the crisis economic situation have led to various legal reports from the CGPJ, judicial associations, lawyers, which have been integrated into a crash plan by the Ministry of Justice This plan foresees imminent procesual, organizational and technological reforms, some incorporated by RDL 16/2020 A moment of crisis that as a cause or as an excuse presents a period of changes in Justice ? 2020 Ibero-American Law Institute All rights reserved","output":"Post-coronavirus civil justice, from the crisis to some of the reforms envisaged"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of Covid-19 and its long-term consequences is not yet fully understood.

METHODS: The present study is a comprehensive national registry-based study in Sweden with a 4-month follow-up. All people who started to receive sickness benefits for Covid-19 during March 1 to August 31, 2020, were included. Predictors of sick leave &#8805;1 month and long Covid (&#8805;12 weeks) were analysed with logistic regression in the total population and in separate models depending on inpatient care due to Covid-19. RESULTS: A total of 11,955 people started sick leave for Covid-19 within the inclusion period. The median sick leave was 35 days, 13.3% were on sick leave for long Covid, and 9.0% remained on sick leave for the whole follow-up period. There were 2960 people who received inpatient care due to Covid-19, which was the strongest predictor of longer sick leave. Sick leave the year prior to Covid-19 and older age also predicted longer sick leave. No clear pattern of socioeconomic factors was noted. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of people are on sick leave due to Covid-19. Sick leave may be protracted, and sick leave for long Covid is quite common. The severity of Covid-19 (needing inpatient care), prior sick leave, and age all seem to predict the likelihood of longer sick leave.

Data were collected through in-depth individual telephone interviews from ten transgender women selected through the snowballing technique. Data were analysed guided by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis framework. The findings revealed that transgender women living with HIV faced homelessness and starvation during the Covid-19 lockdown. In order to avert starvation and homelessness, some of the transgender women engaged in risky behavior such as providing commercial sex without condoms to obtain more money, caring for people who tested positive for Covid-19, staying in abusive relationships, and illegally using their shacks as brothels and bottle stores. Consequently, these behaviors have increased their risk of being infected with HIV and contracting other sexually transmittable infections and predisposed them to arrest. All these occurred due to a lack of support. Recommendations are made to improve advocacy and support for transgender individuals from the foundation up to tertiary educational institutions to reduce stigma and discrimination. These include adapting infrastructure such as toilets and classroom settings to be gender neutral to accommodate transgender individuals.

Birds are natural reservoir of various viruses, but the existence of coronaviruses in wild birds in central China has been barely studied. Some bird coronaviruses belongs to the genus of Deltacoronavirus. To explore the diversity of bird deltacoronaviruses in central China, we tested fecal samples from 415 wild birds in Hunan Province, China. By RT\\\\PCR detection, we identified eight samples positive for deltacoronaviruses which were all from common magpies, and in four of them, we successfully amplified complete deltacoronavirus genomes distinct from currently known deltacoronavirus, indicating four novel deltacoronavirus stains (HNU1\\\\1, HNU1\\\\2, HNU2 and HNU3) . Comparative analysis on the four genomic sequences showed that these novel magpie deltacoronaviruses shared three different S genes among which the S genes of HNU1\\\\1 and HNU1\\\\2 showed 93.8% amino acid (aa) identity to that of thrush coronavirus HKU12, HNU2 S showed 71.9% aa identity to that of White\\\\eye coronavirus HKU16, and HKU3 S showed 72.4% aa identity to that of sparrow coronavirus HKU17. Recombination analysis showed that frequent recombination events of the S genes occurred among these deltacoronavirus strains. Two novel putative cleavage sites separating the nonstructural proteins in the HNU coronaviruses were found. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis showed that the south coast of China might be a potential origin of bird deltacoronaviruses existing in inland China. In summary, these results suggest that common magpie in China carries diverse deltacoronaviruses with novel genomic features, indicating an important source of environmental coronaviruses closed to human communities, which may provide key information for prevention and control of future coronavirus epidemics.","output":"Epidemiology and evolution of novel deltacoronaviruses in birds in central China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this review paper, we theoretically explain the origin of electrostatic interactions between lipid bilayers and charged solid surfaces using a statistical mechanics approach, where the orientational degree of freedom of lipid head groups and the orientational ordering of the water dipoles are considered.

The immunogenicity of a first-generation, replication-competent Ad35-based vaccine was tested in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) rhesus macaque model by evaluating its capacity to boost immunity generated by Ad5-based vectors. A series of four immunizations with replication-defective Ad5 vectors expressing SIVmac239 gag induced high-frequency responses mediated by both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells directed against several epitopes. Ad5-specific neutralizing antibody responses that did not neutralize Ad35 were rapidly induced but waned over time. Subsequent immunization with Ad5-based vectors was minimally effective, whereas immunization with Ad35-based vectors generated a strong increase in the frequency of Gag-specific T cells with specificities that were unchanged. While this boosting response was relatively transient, challenge with the distinct pathogenic isolate SIV/DeltaB670 generated robust and selective recall responses to Gag with similar specificities as induced by vaccination that were elevated for 25 weeks relative to controls. Vaccination had measurable albeit minor effects on virus load. Unexpectedly, regional hypervariability within the Gag sequence of SIV/DeltaB670 was associated with mutation of the conserved CD8(+) T-cell epitope CM9 without concurrent flanking mutations and in the absence of immune pressure.

Most striking is the huge difference in risk to dialysis patients and staff across the world. Per-population cases and deaths among dialysis patients vary over 100-fold across participating countries, mirroring burden in the general population. International data indicate case fatality ratio remains at 10-30% among dialysis patients, confirming the gravity of infection, and that cases are much more common among in-center than home dialysis patients.

Under DM, chronic hyperglycemia, and subsequent increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) further lead to cardiac growth remodeling and dysfunction. The purinergic drug ticagrelor is a P(2)Y(12) receptor antagonist. Although it is widely used in cardioprotection, the underlying molecular mechanism of its inhibitory effect on diabetic cardiomyopathy is poorly elucidated. Here, we aimed to understand how ticagrelor exerts its cardio-regulatory effects. For this purpose, we investigated the anti-oxidative and cardioprotective effect of EVs derived from ticagrelor-pretreated cardiomyocytes under DM conditions. To mimic DM in cardiomyocytes, we used high glucose incubated H9c2-cells (HG). HG cells were treated with EVs, which were derived from either ticagrelor-pretreated or untreated H9c2-cells. Our results demonstrated that ticagrelor-pretreated H9c2-derived EVs significantly decreased the hyperglycemia-induced aberrant ROS production, prevented the development of apoptosis and ER stress, and alleviated oxidative stress associated miRNA-expression profile. Importantly, EVs derived from ticagrelor-pretreated H9c2-cells enhanced endothelial cell migration and tube formation, suggesting a modulation of the EV profile in cardiomyocytes. Our data, for the first time, indicate that ticagrelor can exert an important regulatory effect on diabetic cardiomyopathy through extracellular vesicular modulation behind its receptor-inhibition-related effects.","output":"Cardioprotective effect of extracellular vesicles derived from ticagrelor-pretreated cardiomyocyte on hyperglycemic cardiomyocytes through alleviation of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the transition from linear production systems, unsustainable from the point of view of resources, to a model that finds strength in environmental, social and economic sustainability, the circular economy paradigm is the foundation that facilitates the planetary agro-ecological transition. The European Union has taken a number of steps (including the Circular Economy Package of Directives) shaping circularity as a wide-ranging driver measure involving many sectors. The paper intends to provide a regulatory framework on the current general situation regarding circularity in European Union, in order to extrapolate and give evidence to the aspects that intersect the agri-food sector. This is not only because they are poorly addressed in the literature, but also because there is a lack of regulatory instruments on the circular economy specifically addressing this area of interest. For this purpose, the analysis focuses on waste and residue/scrap management issues, recognized by law as by-products and end-of-waste status, as they are covered by circular economy legislation and as they can be applied to the agri-food sector. The latter allow the implementation of circularity strategies in the agri-food sector and, given the numerousness of production chains and the peculiarities of each of them, various regeneration and/or reuse processes of specific resources may be depicted. The intent is to provide useful knowledge on how to implement sustainable waste management, also proposing a concrete case on a by-product of olive oil processing, through which it is possible to highlight how the correct application of regulations favors the adoption of circular economic and management models in the firms involved, as well as informing the relevant economic operators on the possible profiles of legal liability that may arise from insufficient knowledge.

ZEBOV primarily targets mononuclear phagocytes, which are activated upon infection and secrete mediators believed to trigger initial stages of pathogenesis. The characterization of the responses of target cells to ZEBOV infection may therefore not only further understanding of pathogenesis but also suggest possible points of therapeutic intervention. Gene expression profiles of primary human macrophages exposed to ZEBOV were determined using DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to gain insight into the cellular response immediately after cell entry. Significant changes in mRNA concentrations encoding for 88 cellular proteins were observed. Most of these proteins have not yet been implicated in ZEBOV infection. Some, however, are inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during the acute phase of disease in the blood of ZEBOV-infected humans. Interestingly, the cellular response occurred within the first hour of Ebola virion exposure, i.e. prior to virus gene expression. This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response. Indeed, ZEBOV virions, LPS, and virus-like particles consisting of only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and GP(1,2) (VLP(VP40-GP)) triggered comparable responses in macrophages, including pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals. In contrast, VLP(VP40) (particles lacking GP(1,2)) caused an aberrant response. This suggests that GP(1,2) binding to macrophages plays an important role in the immediate cellular response.","output":"Ebola Virion Attachment and Entry into Human Macrophages Profoundly Effects Early Cellular Gene Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To evaluate effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on all-cause mortality, major adverse limb event (MALE), MALE and postoperative death (MALE + POD), and amputation after endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal disease.

To explore differences between Spanish autonomous communities or according to hospital size and disease incidence in the area. MATERIAL AND METHODS Survey of the heads of 283 EDs in hospitals belonging to or affiliated with Spain's public health service. Respondents evaluated the pandemic's impact on organization, resources, and staff absence from work in March and April 2020. Assessments were for 15-day periods. Results were analyzed overall and by autonomous community, hospital size, and local population incidence rates. RESULTS A total of 246 (87%) responses were received. The majority of the EDs organized a triage system, first aid, and observation wards; areas specifically for patients suspected of having COVID-19 were newly set apart. The nursing staff was increased in 83% of the EDs (with no subgroup differences), and 59% increased the number of physicians (especially in large hospitals and locations where the COVID-19 incidence was high). Diagnostic tests for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were the resource the EDs missed most: 55% reported that tests were scarce often or very often. Other resources reported to be scarce were FPP2 and FPP3 masks (38% of the EDs), waterproof protective gowns (34%), and space (32%). More than 5% of the physicians, nurses, or other emergency staff were on sick leave 20%, 19%, and 16% of the time. These deficiencies were greatest during the last half of March, except for tests, which were most scarce in the first 15 days. Large hospital EDs less often reported that diagnostic tests were unavailable. In areas where the COVID-19 incidence was higher, the EDs reported higher rates of staff on sick leave. Resource scarcity differed markedly by autonomous community and was not always associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the population. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic led to organizational changes in EDs. Certain resources became scarce, and marked differences between autonomous communities were detected.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital emergency departments: results of a survey of departments in 2020 - the Spanish ENCOVUR study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The option prioritization is the most effective preference ranking approach within the framework of the graph model for conflict resolution, in which a set of option statements for each decision maker (DM) involved in a dispute is determined by individual judgments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey comprised questions on the prevention and management of white spot lesions (WSL). The questionnaire was sent via email to orthodontists working in practices and universities throughout Germany. The analysis involved descriptive statistics using the chi-square test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: A prevention protocol was used before MBT by 80.6% of the participants. Less than a quarter of the participants regularly applied topical fluoride (gel or varnish) during MBT. According to the respondents assessment, the prevalence of WSL during MBT is 11.6%, mainly observed in 12- to 15-year-old male patients. Orthodontists graduating after 2000 tended to recommend and apply fluoride-containing materials more often than their senior colleagues (p = 0.039). Participants from private practices applied fluoride varnish or gel more frequently than those from university clinics (p = 0.013). Fluoridation was the most common (70.7%) treatment for WSL after MBT, followed by resin infiltration (21.2%). The majority (80.9%) of the participants favor a guideline for preventing WSL. CONCLUSIONS: WSL prevention during MBT is challenging. Males in puberty are predominantly affected. Younger orthodontists are more concerned about the prevention of WSL during MBT.

These disease-related biomarkers often exist at very low levels in biological fluids, necessitating ultrasensitive measurement methods. Single-molecule arrays (Simoa), a bead-based digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, is the current state of the art for ultrasensitive protein detection and can detect sub-femtomolar protein concentrations, but its ability to achieve high-order multiplexing without cross-reactivity remains a challenge. Here, a sequential protein capture approach for multiplex Simoa assays is implemented to eliminate cross-reactivity between binding reagents by sequentially capturing each protein analyte and then incubating each capture bead with only its corresponding detection antibody. This strategy not only reduces cross-reactivity to background levels and significantly improves measurement accuracies, but also enables higher-order multiplexing. As a proof of concept, the sequential multiplex Simoa assay is used to measure five different cytokines in plasma samples from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The ultrasensitive sequential multiplex Simoa assays will enable the simultaneous measurements of multiple low-abundance analytes in a time- and cost-effective manner and will prove especially critical in many cases where sample volumes are limited.","output":"Sequential Protein Capture in Multiplex Single Molecule Arrays: A Strategy for Eliminating Assay Cross-Reactivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have shown that optimal adherence to antihypertensive agents could protect against cardiovascular diseases, but whether adherence reduces cardiovascular deaths in community settings has not been explored so fully. This study evaluates the association between antihypertensive adherence and cardiovascular (coronary heart disease and stroke) mortality in the primary care settings. METHODS: From a territory-wide database in Hong Kong, we included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents in the years between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and assigned as having poor (Proportion of Days Covered [PDC] < 40%), intermediate (40C79%), and high ( 80%) adherence to antihypertensive agents. The association between antihypertensive adherence and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated by using the Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: From a total of 218,047 eligible patients, 3825 patients (1.75%) died of cardiovascular disease within five years after having received their first-ever antihypertensive agents. The proportions of patients having poor, intermediate, and high medication adherence were 32.9%, 12.1%, and 55.0%, respectively. Higher adherence levels at PDC 40%C79% (HR = 0.46, 95% C.I. 0.41C0.52, p < 0.001) and  80% (HR = 0.91, 95% C.I. 0.85C0.98, p = 0.012) were significantly less likely to be associated with mortality than the poor adherence (PDC0.040) group.

For protein evolution, this order is often determined by first arranging sequences into a phylogenetic tree, which has limiting assumptions and can suffer from substantial ambiguity. Here, we demonstrate how machine learning algorithms called language models can learn mutational likelihoods that predict the directionality of evolution, thereby enabling phylogenetic analysis that addresses key limitations of existing methods. Our main conceptual advance is to construct a vector field of protein evolution through local evolutionary predictions that we refer to as evolutionary velocity (evo-velocity). We show that evo-velocity can successfully predict evolutionary order at vastly different timescales, from viral proteins evolving over years to eukaryotic proteins evolving over geologic eons. Evo-velocity also yields new evolutionary insights, predicting strategies of viral-host immune escape, resolving conflicting theories on the evolution of serpins, and revealing a key role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of eukaryotic glycolysis. In doing so, our work suggests that language models can learn sufficient rules of natural protein evolution to enable evolutionary predictability.","output":"Evolutionary velocity with protein language models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thromboembolism is a recognized component of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. However, research into racial disparities in COVID-19-related pulmonary embolism is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we examined adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 20 and September 30, 2020, using a multicenter electronic health record dataset of over 73 million patients (TriNetX), mostly in the USA. The main study outcomes were development of pulmonary embolism or mortality within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Secondary outcome analysis included hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission within 30 days of diagnosis, as well as lab values within 0C1 days of diagnosis. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were used to create balanced cohorts via propensity matching. RESULTS: 346,953 patients were identified, with 56.0% non-Hispanic white and 14.7% non-Hispanic black; the mean age was 47.6 years. 3879 patients developed PE, with 2036 (1.30% of 157,049) white and 1088 (2.16% of 50,376) black patients. After propensity matching, black race was associated with higher mortality (risk ratio 1.890 [95% CI 1.727C2.067]) and PE (RR 1.537 [1.380C1.711]; p < 0.0001). Both races had higher mortality with COVID-associated PE than COVID or PE alone (RR 1.575C1.627 and 3.000C5.389 respectively; p < 0.0001). Black patients with COVID-19 and PE had a higher rate of mortality compared to white patients (RR 1.397 [1.059C1.844]; p = 0.0174).

Study selection: All types of healthcare workers providing any kind of healthcare to any patient population in any setting. Data extraction: At least two reviewers independently extracted guideline characteristics, conducted critical appraisal according to The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II) and classified the guidelines using the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF) Guidance Manual and Rules for Guideline Development. We plan six-month updates (living review). Data synthesis: There were 1342 titles screened and 188 guidelines included. The highest average AGREE II domain score was 89% for scope and purpose, the lowest for rigor of development (25%). Only eight guidelines (4%) were based on a systematic literature search and a structured consensus process by representative experts (classified as the highest methodological quality, S3 according to AWMF). Patients were only included in the development of one guideline. A process for regular updates was described in 27 guidelines (14%). Limitations: Methodological focus only.

Such practice entails double-wiping all surfaces including the floor with disinfectants before a non-VRE patient can use the endoscopy room. While intuitive, such time-consuming practice is not supported by evidence and may have unintended negative impact on patient access to timely endoscopic evaluation. AIMS: To determine whether terminal cleaning of endoscopy suite for VRE-colonized patients has any negative impact on inpatient access to timely endoscopic evaluation. METHODS: As part of a quality improvement study, inpatient endoscopy data was gathered over a 3-month period between February 2021 and April 2021 at a tertiary centre. EUS, ERCP, and travel cases outside of the endoscopy suite were excluded. The cancellation rates were compared between VRE-colonized patients and non-VRE patients using the Fishers exact test. P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 262 inpatient endoscopic procedures were scheduled and included in the study. Sixty-six (25.2%) of inpatient procedures were cancelled during this period (Table 1). A total of 24 procedures were scheduled for VRE patients, 9 of which were cancelled because of insufficient operating time and two due to concurrent carbapenamase-producing organism carriage and poor bowel preparation. In the non-VRE group, 55 (23.3%) procedures were cancelled for various reasons (Table 1). In subgroup analysis where cancellations related to COVID-19 (n=14) were omitted, VRE patients had a significantly higher rate of procedure cancellations compared to non-VRE patients (42.3% vs. 18.5%; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The overall endoscopy cancellation rate for VRE-colonized patients was higher than those who were non-VRE-colonized. We propose that this is likely secondary to the delays from unnecessary terminal cleans imposed for VRE-colonized patients and await for post-intervention data.

Intra-cellular immune signaling is tightly regulated by various post-translational modifications, which allow for this dynamic response. One of the post-translational modifiers critical for immune control is ubiquitin, which can be covalently conjugated to lysines in target molecules, thereby altering their functional properties. This is achieved in a process involving E3 ligases which determine ubiquitination target specificity. One of the most prominent E3 ligase families is that of the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, which counts over 70 members in humans. Over the last years, various studies have contributed to the notion that many members of this protein family are important immune regulators. Recent studies into the mechanisms by which some of the TRIMs regulate the innate immune system have uncovered important immune regulatory roles of both covalently attached, as well as unanchored poly-ubiquitin chains. This review highlights TRIM evolution, recent findings in TRIM-mediated immune regulation, and provides an outlook to current research hurdles and future directions.","output":"InTRIMsic immunity: Positive and negative regulation of immune signaling by tripartite motif proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although most countries and healthcare systems worldwide have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, some groups of the population may be more vulnerable to detrimental effects of the pandemic on mental health than others. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise evidence currently available from systematic reviews on the impact of COVID-19 and other coronavirus outbreaks on mental health for groups of the population thought to be at increased risk of detrimental mental health impacts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of reviews on adults and children residing in a country affected by a coronavirus outbreak and belonging to a group considered to be at risk of experiencing mental health inequalities. Data were collected on symptoms or diagnoses of any mental health condition, quality of life, suicide or attempted suicide. The protocol for this systematic review was registered in the online PROSPERO database prior to commencing the review (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=194264). RESULTS: We included 25 systematic reviews. Most reviews included primary studies of hospital workers from multiple countries. Reviews reported variable estimates for the burden of symptoms of mental health problems among acute healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients with physical comorbidities, and children and adolescents. No evaluations of interventions were identified. Risk- and protective factors, mostly for healthcare workers, showed the importance of personal factors, the work environment, and social networks for mental health.

The impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of pregnant status are highly linked with prenatal anxiety. Whereas, self-efficacy and support from family and friends could attenuate the development of prenatal anxiety. Thus, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of prenatal anxiety and its influence factors among pregnant women during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Shenyang, China. Methods A cross-sectional study with face-to-face interview between April 24, 2020 and May 3, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic was applied among pregnant women in Shenyang Womens and Childrens Hospital. Chi-square tests were calculated to determine the differences in prenatal anxiety among categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to investigate the risk factors of prenatal anxiety. Results The percentage of prenatal anxiety (GAD-7 score  7) among pregnant women during the pandemic of COVID-19 was 34/304 (11.18%). Logistic regression indicated that vomiting (OR 4.454, 95% CI 1.113C17.821) and feeling susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 2.966, 95% CI 1.151C7.642) increased the odds of prenatal anxiety. Satisfaction with medical care (OR 0.303, 95% CI 0.113C0.813) and self-efficacy (OR 0.253, 95% CI 0.100C0.639) decreased the odds of prenatal anxiety. High monthly income (OR 0.246, 95% CI 0.078 ~ 0.780) reduced the chances of suffering from prenatal anxiety. Conclusion The pregnant women in China exerted a higher prevalence of prenatal anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic than that without COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, interventions on self-efficacy enhancement and high-quality medical prenatal care should be provided to prevent from the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce prenatal anxiety.","output":"Prenatal anxiety and the associated factors among Chinese pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemica smartphone questionnaire survey study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Previously, we have reported potential clinical benefits with the use of statins in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a meta-analysis, where there was a significantly reduced hazard for a fatal or severe course of illness with the use of statins, but the meta-analysis was limited by the small number of studies included, with small heterogeneity among studies, due to the unavailability of more studies at the point of literature search. We aimed to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence on the effect of statins on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, and preprint servers were searched (last updated June 3, 2021) to identify studies investigating the association between the use of statins in patients with COVID-19 and the development of severe disease and/or mortality. Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The outcomes of interest were (1) all-cause mortality and (2) a composite endpoint of severe illness of COVID-19. RESULTS: Upon systematic literature search, we identified 35 studies, of which 32 studies reported the outcome of all-cause mortality and 15 studies reported the composite endpoint of severe COVID-19 illness between statin users versus non-statin users with COVID-19.

The infected individuals may present mild to severe symptoms, with nearly 20% of the confirmed patients impaired with significant complications, including multi-organ failure. Acute respiratory distress imposed by SARS-CoV-2 largely results from an aggravated cytokine storm and deregulated immune response. The forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are reported to play a significant role in maintaining normal cell physiology by regulating survival, apoptosis, oxidative stress, development and maturation of T and B lymphocytes, secretion of inflammatory cytokines, etc. We propose a potent anti-inflammatory approach based on activation of the FoxO as an attractive strategy against the novel coronavirus. This regime will be focused on restoring redox and inflammatory homeostasis along with repair of the damaged tissue, activation of lymphocyte effector and memory cells. Repurposing FoxO activators as a means to alleviate the inflammatory burst following SARS-CoV-2 infection can prove immensely valuable in the ongoing pandemic and provide a reliable groundwork for enriching our repertoire of antiviral modalities for any such complication in the future.

Reported mechanisms of CAC include activated coagulation, endotheliopathy, up-regulated innate and adaptive immunity, and activated complement system. Although the clinical features and laboratory findings of CAC and DIC seem different, there are fundamental similarities that should be considered. Basically, the pathological findings of COVID-19 fall within the scope of the definition of DIC, i.e., systemic activation of coagulation caused by or resulting from the microvascular damage. Therefore, we suggest that although CAC differs from usual infection-associated DIC, its various features indicate that it can be considered a thrombotic phenotype DIC.

The active screening requires regional governance that manages the processes' complexity integrating a well-organized network between territory assistance and hospital to achieve an effective HCV care cascade. This document aims to support the regional decision-making process by defining paths for screening and linkage-to-care. Implementing active screening strategies beyond a risk-based approach is required as a General Practitioners' task. Simplified paths must be drawn for the key populations screening. The infrastructure built for COVID-19 vaccination could be used also for HCV screening. According to a multidisciplinary care delivery, screening should be supplemented with rapid linkage-to-care and treatment of newly diagnosed patients.

Studies and guidelines have emerged both for and against the use of imaging as a frontline tool to investigate such patients. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is suggested as the backbone of diagnosis. We designed and tested a diagnostic algorithm using artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the role of imaging in the evaluation of patients with acute flu-like presentation. Materials and Methods Overall, 3,235 consecutive patients with flu-like presentation were evaluated over a period of 240 days. All patients underwent plain radiographs of chest with computer-aided detection for COVID-19 (CAD4COVID) AI analysis. Based on the threshold scores, they were divided into two groups: group A (score < 50) and group B (score > 50). Group A patients were discharged and put on routine symptomatic treatment and follow-up with RT-PCR, while group B patients underwent high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) followed by COVID-19 AI analysis and RT-PCR test. These were then triaged into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 subgroups based on COVID-19 similarity scores by AI, and lung severity scores were also determined. Results Group A had 2,209 (68.3%) patients with CAD4COVID score of <50 while 1,026 (31.7%) patients comprised group B. Also, 825 (25.5%) patients were COVID-19 positive with COVID-19 similarity threshold of >0.85 on AI. RT-PCR was positive in 415 and false-negative in 115 patients while 12 patients died before the test could be done. The sensitivity and specificity of CAD4COVID AI analysis on plain radiographs for detection of any lung abnormality combined with HRCT AI analysis was 97.9% and 99% using the above algorithm. Conclusion Combined use of chest radiographs and plain HRCT with AI-based analysis is useful and an accurate frontline tool to triage patients with acute flu-like symptoms in non-COVID-19 health care facilities.","output":"Use of Artificial Intelligence to Triage Patients with Flu-Like Symptoms Using Imaging in Non-COVID-19 Hospitals during COVID-19 Pandemic: An Ongoing 8-Month Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Trauma places a burden on healthcare services accounting for a large proportion of Emergency Department presentations.

Evidence of patterns within these conditions can support decision-making by identifying where action is urgent and which policies and interventions are needed to mitigate negative impacts and enhance positive impacts. Within the scope of the EU-funded project EURO-HEALTHY (Shaping EUROpean policies to promote HEALTH equitY), the City of Lisbon was selected as a case study to apply a multidimensional and participatory assessment approach of urban health whose purpose was to inform the evaluation of policies and interventions with potential to address local health gaps. In this paper, we present the set of indicators identified as drivers of urban health inequities within the City of Lisbon, exploring the added value of using a spatial indicator framework together with a participation process to orient a place-based assessment and to inform policies aimed at reducing health inequities. Two workshops with a panel of local stakeholders from health and social care services, municipal departments (e.g. urban planning, environment, social rights and education) and non-governmental and community-based organizations were organized. The aim was to engage local stakeholders to identify locally critical situations and select indicators of health determinants from a spatial equity perspective. To support the analysis, a matrix of 46 indicators of health determinants, with data disaggregated at the city neighbourhood scale, was constructed and was complemented with maps. The panel identified critical situations for urban health equity in 28 indicators across eight intervention axes: economic conditions, social protection and security; education; demographic change; lifestyles and behaviours; physical environment; built environment; road safety and healthcare resources and performance. The geographical distribution of identified critical situations showed that all 24 city neighbourhoods presented one or more problems. A group of neighbourhoods systematically perform worse in most indicators from different intervention axes, requiring not only priority action but mainly a multi- and intersectoral policy response. The indicator matrices and maps have provided a snapshot of urban inequities across different intervention axes, making a compelling argument for boosting intersectoral work across municipal departments and local stakeholders in the City of Lisbon. This study, by integrating local evidence in combination with social elements, pinpoints the importance of a place-based approach for assessing urban health equity.","output":"Assessing Urban Health Inequities through a Multidimensional and Participatory Framework: Evidence from the EURO-HEALTHY Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing number of meta-analyses including data from non-randomized studies for therapeutic evaluation.

The COVID mandates in 2020 have accelerated the transition to remote work, generating major uncertainty regarding how residential power consumption patterns will shift. Understanding these shifts is vital for regional operators who will need to implement long-term planning strategies if companies continue to adopt remote work practices. Additionally, if new COVID variants prompt extended stay-at-home mandates, the resulting behavior shifts will decide the optimal combination of power generation in a region. Our study examines changes in hourly residential power consumption patterns resulting from COVID mandates in Arizona. We estimate how the COVID mandates and subsequent remote work practices could change the power consumption patterns using individual-consumer-level hourly power consumption data for 6,309 consumers and a machine learning framework. We also simulate how the hourly power consumption pattern will change with increasing penetration of remote work under winter and summer temperature settings. We then use our simulations to test the policy effectiveness of changing time-of-use (TOU) rates. Our results show that COVID mandates likely increase the power consumption in the afternoon by 13%, and can change the power consumption pattern in winter from a two-peaked shape to a one-peaked shape. Furthermore, we show that the residents' income, race, and house size are significantly correlated with the changes in power consumption, and the correlation is not linear. We find that, by increasing the peak hour prices and decreasing the off-peak hour prices by 10% of the TOU pricing, the peak electricity demand could be reduced by 10%. Our results show under the new remote work era: (1) the need for modifying previous energy generation combination planning due to changing peak demand hours;(2) equity concerns regarding TOU pricing and the inability of vulnerable groups to shift electricity consumption;(3) the ability of governments and utilities to lower the maximum load of power consumption by modifying the TOU rates.","output":"Changes in hourly electricity consumption under COVID mandates: A glance to future hourly residential power consumption pattern with remote work in Arizona"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout March 2020, cases of COVID\\\\19 grew exponentially, and New York emerged as an epicenter of the crisis.

Regardless, an established animal experimental method to examine the effect of physical inactivity on physiological, biochemical, and neuroscientific parameters is yet to be reported. In this study, we made a new housing cage, named as the physical inactivity (PI) cage, to investigate the effect of physical inactivity on cognitive function and depressive-like states in mice and obtained the following experimental results by its use. We first compared the daily physical activity of mice housed in the PI and standard cages using the nano-tag method. The mices physical activity levels in the PI cage decreased to approximately half of that in the mice housed in the standard cage. Second, we examined whether housing in the PI cage affected plasma corticosterone concentration. The plasma corticosterone concentration did not alter before, 1 week, or 10 weeks after housing. Third, we investigated whether housing in the PI cage for 10 weeks affected cognitive function and depressive behavior. Housing in an inactive state caused a cognitive decline and depressive state in the mice without increasing body weight and plasma corticosterone. Finally, we examined the effect of regular low-intensity exercise on cognitive function and depressive state in the mice housed in the PI cage. Physical inactivity decreased neuronal cell proliferation, blood vessel density, and gene expressions of vascular endothelial growth factors and brain-derived neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus. In addition, regular low-intensity exercise, 30 min of treadmill running at a 5C15 m/min treadmill speed 3 days per week, prevented cognitive decline and the onset of a depressive-like state caused by physical inactivity.

OBJECTIVE: In this context, we decided to study certain consequences of the abundant cytokine release over the innate and adaptive immune systems, inflammation, and hemostasis, comparing mild and severe forms of COVID-19. METHODS: To accomplish these aims, we will analyze demographic characteristics, biochemical tests, immune biomarkers, leukocyte phenotyping, immunoglobulin profile, hormonal release (cortisol and prolactin), gene expression, thromboelastometry, neutralizing antibodies, metabolic profile, and neutrophil function (reactive oxygen species production, neutrophil extracellular trap production, phagocytosis, migration, gene expression, and proteomics). A total of 200 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed patients will be enrolled and divided into two groups: mild/moderate or severe/critical forms of COVID-19. Blood samples will be collected at different times: at inclusion and after 9 and 18 days, with an additional 3-day sample for severe patients.

Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face-to-face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates. MAIN RESULTS: We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health-related quality of life. Caregivers receiving training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings.","output":"Remotely delivered information, training and support for informal caregivers of people with dementia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity and outcome of respiratory viral infections is partially determined by the cellular response mounted by infected lung epithelial cells. Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host responses to different viruses while controlling other experimental parameters. We compared changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to discover mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.","output":"Lung epithelial cells have virus-specific and shared gene expression responses to infection by diverse respiratory viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic and exerted a profound physiological and mental impact on the public Due to anxiety from being bombarded by information from the news and social media, people may constantly read and repost, with a fear of missing out (FOMO), information about COVID-19 on social media So far, there has been little research on COVID-19 FOMO We therefore compiled the COVID-19 information fear of missing out scale (CIFS) and administered it to 1178 adults in Taiwan to identify the possible factors influencing CIFS scores We demonstrated that the CIFS had good reliability, factor validity, and criterion validity With regard to demographic variables, we found that gender, marital status, travel time to the nearest hospital, and educational background influenced CIFS scores In contrast, the participant age and whether he or she lived in an urban area did not affect the CIFS scores With regard to social media usage, social media usage time (r = 0 025) and the numbers of COVID-19-related posts read on social media (r = 0 117) or instant messaging (r = 0 169) were not highly correlated with CIFS scores Rather, CIFS scores were found to be significantly correlated to the frequency of reposting COVID-19-related information on social media (r = 0 497) and on instant messaging (r = 0 447) These results indicate that CIFS scores are closely associated not with passive browsing on social media but with the frequency at which an individual actively reposts information In other words, what creates CIF is not an overabundance of information (i e , an infodemic) but the active reposting and interpretation of information Individual autonomy for interpretation of the received information and self-determination about reposting are key factors for COVID-19 information FOMO When facing the COVID-19-related news on social media, it is the active information-related FOMO, not the passive infodemic, that influences our social media usage","output":"Toward COVID-19 Information: Infodemic or Fear of Missing Out?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is associated with oxidative stress, peripheral hyper inflammation, and neuroinflammation, especially in individuals with a more severe form of the disease. Some studies provide evidence on the onset or exacerbation of major depressive disorder (MDD), among other psychiatric disorders due to COVID-19. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are associated conditions, especially in the more severe form of MDD and in refractoriness to available therapeutic strategies. Inflammatory cytokines in the COVID-19 hyper inflammation process can activate the hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal (HPA) axis and the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme.

Our goal was to review the indications and outcomes of TAMIS in a large series. STUDY DESIGN A review of a prospective database identified patients who underwent TAMIS from 2010 to 2014. Demographic, perioperative, short-term outcomes, and recurrence data were analyzed. RESULTS There were 75 patients with 76 lesions analyzed. Mean age was 64.0 years (SD 11.6 years) and mean BMI was 27.4 kg/m(2) (SD 4.7 kg/m(2)). Median American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score was 2 (range 1 to 4). There were 59 benign (77.3%) and 17 malignant (22.7%) lesions: 6 pT0, 6 pT1, 4 pT2, and 1 pT3. Median lesion distance from the anal verge was 10 cm (range 6 to 16 cm). Mean operative time was 76.0 minutes (SD 36.1 minutes). Three patients had intraperitoneal entry; all were closed transanally, but 2 had temporary diverting ileostomies fashioned to ensure healing. Median length of stay was 1 day (range 0 to 6). One patient had a fragmented lesion (1.3%). Five patients had positive margins: 2 in palliative pT2 resections, and 3 in pT1, pT2, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients. They were managed with radical resection (pT1 and pT2 lesions) and surveillance/medical oncology (GIST). Postoperatively, 3 patients had complications (bleeding, rectal stricture, and recto-vaginal fistula), and all were managed nonoperatively. After median follow-up of 39.5 months (range 10.5 to 65.3 months), 1 pT1 patient with negative margins developed a local recurrence and underwent salvage APR. CONCLUSIONS Transanal minimally invasive surgery is a viable option for excision of benign or early stage rectal masses, with mid-term oncologic outcomes comparable to those of radical resection. Further, TAMIS minimizes the morbidity and can allow more patients to benefit from the minimally invasive approach.","output":"Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery: Review of Indications and Outcomes from 75 Consecutive Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Auditor reporting on going-concern-related uncertainties remains one of the most challenging issues faced by external auditors. Business owners, market participants and audit regulators want an early warning of impending business failure. However, companies typically do not welcome audit opinions indicating uncertainty regarding their future viability. Thus, the auditor's decision to issue a \\"going concern opinion\\" (GCO) is a complex and multi-layered one, facing a great deal of tension. Given such a rich context, academic researchers have examined many facets related to an auditor's decision to issue a GCO. This monograph reviews and synthesizes 182 recent GCO studies that have appeared since the last significant review published in 2013 through the end of 2019. The authors categorize studies into the three broad areas of GCO: (1) determinants, (2) accuracy and (3) consequences. As an integral part of their synthesis, they summarize the details of each study in several user-friendly tables. After discussing and synthesizing the research, they present a discussion of opportunities for future research, including issues created or exacerbated as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. This monograph will be of assistance to researchers interested in exploring this area of auditor responsibility. It will also be of interest to auditing firms and individual practitioners wanting to learn what academic research has examined and found regarding this challenging aspect of audit practice. Auditing standard-setters and regulators will find it of interest as the authors review numerous studies examining issues related to audit policy and regulation, and their effects on GCO decisions. The examination of GCO research is extremely timely given the financial and business disruption caused by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. This unprecedented global event has caused companies, auditors and professional bodies to revisit and reassess their approach to going concern, and to think even more deeply about this fundamental business imperative. ? 2021 Marshall A.

This property lends itself to application in endovascular medical devices. Peripheral vasculature embolisation devices incorporating this novel technology have become commercially available and this case series, where the data were collected as part of a post market registry, outlines initial clinical experience with these novel devices. RESULTS Eight cases are described in this series. The disease state/conditions for which embolisation was indicated were right common iliac artery aneurysms (n = 3), a type II endoleak into the thoracic aorta following thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (n = 1), a left inferior gluteal artery aneurysm (n = 1), left internal iliac artery aneurysms (n = 2), and a case of splenomegaly, where splenectomy was planned after the embolisation procedure (n = 1). Target arteries were 5-10 mm in diameter. In each case, at least one IMPEDE Embolization Plug (IMP-Device) of an appropriate diameter was used. All procedures were technically successful and target vessel thrombosis was achieved in all cases. Follow-up imaging available during the 45-90-day data collection timeframe showed sustained vessel occlusion. This case series includes examples of situations commonly encountered when embolising the peripheral vasculature, namely, the use of one or multiple devices in a single vessel and in combination with the use of other embolic devices (e.g., microcoils, gelatin sponge, and PVA particles) in the same case. There were no adverse events related to the specific use of the device. CONCLUSIONS This small series illustrates the safety and efficacy of this novel sponge-based embolic device for the embolisation of small and medium sized arteries and further experience will demonstrate the utility of the shape memory polymer devices.","output":"Clinical experience with a shape memory polymer peripheral vascular embolisation plug: a case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent spread of COVID-19 has led to the worst economic crisis since the 1930s.

We do so by exploiting the unique opportunity that the new wave of the survey included an experimental question to calculate the marginal propensity to consume from hypothetical windfall gains. Our results show that households on average spend between about 33% (the Netherlands) and 57% (Lithuania) of such a transfer.

Clinicopathological characteristics were compared between patients with DM (DM group, n = 139) and those without DM (non-DM group, n = 1092). The clinical factors associated with postoperative complications and prognostic factors were identified. RESULTS The DM group had distinct clinicopathological features. No significant differences in histological invasiveness or stage were found. The presence and control status of DM were independent predictors of postoperative complications. No significant differences in recurrence-free survival or cancer-specific survival were observed; however, the DM group had worse overall survival (OS). The DM group had a higher number of deaths from other diseases than the non-DM group, and these patients had significantly higher postoperative hemoglobin A1c levels than patients with cancer-related death. CONCLUSION The presence and control status of preoperative DM are useful predictors of both postoperative complications and OS in operable NSCLC patients.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected every aspect of healthcare systems, including LESS training, which must be modified to minimise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A 3-session training programme was designed in 2020 during the epidemic, which was modified in 2019 before the pandemic. Session 1 was an online study on LESS knowledge. Session 2 involved the trainees' self-directed simulator-training. Task performance was evaluated using the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) scoring. Session 3 was practical training, including trainers' live surgical video demonstrations and trainees' surgical video feedback after training. Video feedback performance was evaluated using the modified global rating scale (GRS). Furthermore, trainees completed a general self-efficacy (GSE) instrument. Forty-two gynaecology trainees were allocated into two groups: novices (n=32) and experts (n=10). RESULTS Compared with pre-training, FLS scores improved in peg transfer (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01) and pattern cutting (P = 0.02 and P <0.001) for novices and experts, respectively. Participants (81% vs. 67%) provided first and second video feedback, respectively. Compared to the first feedback, the GRS scores of both groups improved significantly in the second feedback.

This paper highlights key priorities for safeguarding women's and girls' health in disaster contexts, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, by drawing on learning from the multiple crises facing Beirut, including responding to the pandemic, economic collapse, and the Beirut Port Explosion in 2020.","output":"Prioritising women's and girls' health in disaster settings: Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and the overlapping crises affecting Beirut, Lebanon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged the traditional public health balance between benefiting the good of the community through contract tracing and restricting individual liberty.

People infected with HIV-1 are a particularly vulnerable group, as they may be at a higher risk than the general population of contracting COVID-19 with clinical complications. For such patients, drugs with a broad spectrum of antiviral activity are of paramount importance. Glycyrrhizinic acid (Glyc) and its derivatives are promising biologically active compounds for the development of such broad-spectrum antiviral agents. In this work, derivatives of Glyc obtained by acylation with nicotinic acid were investigated. The resulting preparation, Glycyvir, is a multi-component mixture containing mainly mono-, di-, tri- and tetranicotinates. The composition of Glycyvir was characterized by HPLC-MS/MS and its toxicity assessed in cell culture. Antiviral activity against three strains of SARS-CoV-2 was tested in vitro on Vero E6 cells by MTT assay. Glycyvir was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro (IC(50)2C8 M) with an antiviral activity comparable to the control drug Remdesivir. In addition, Glycyvir exhibited marked inhibitory activity against HIV pseudoviruses of subtypes B, A6 and the recombinant form CRF63_02A (IC(50) range 3.9C27.5 M). The time-dependence of Glycyvir inhibitory activity on HIV pseudovirus infection of TZM-bl cells suggested that the compound interfered with virus entry into the target cell.

Therefore, development of supplements that target APOE genotype-modulated processes could provide a great benefit for the aging population. Evidence suggests a link between APOE genotype and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); however, clinical studies with current DHA supplements have produced negative results in dementia. The lack of beneficial effects with current DHA supplements may be related to limited bioavailability, as the optimal form of DHA for brain uptake is lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-DHA. We previously developed a method to enrich the LPC-DHA content of krill oil through lipase treatment (LT-krill oil), which resulted in fivefold higher enrichment in brain DHA levels in wild-type mice compared with untreated krill oil. Here, we evaluated the effect of a control diet, diet containing krill oil, or a diet containing LT-krill oil in APOE3- and APOE4-targeted replacement mice (APOE-TR mice; treated from 4 to 12 months of age). We found that DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus are lower in APOE4-TR mice and that LT-krill oil increased DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus of both APOE3- and APOE4-TR mice. In APOE4-TR mice, LT-krill oil treatment resulted in higher levels of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A and improved performance on the novel object recognition test. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that LPC-DHA/EPA-enriched krill oil can increase brain DHA and improve memory-relevant behavior in mice that express APOE4.

GMAS was developed and validated among Urdu-speaking patients with chronic diseases. However, validated tool in Nepalese language to measure medication adherence among chronic illness patients currently does not exist. AIM: To translate, culturally adapt, and validate the English version of GMAS into the Nepalese language to measure medication adherence among chronic illness patients. METHODS: The study was conducted among patients with chronic diseases in both hospital and community pharmacies of Nepal. The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) Good Practice Guideline for linguistic translation and cultural adaptation was used to translate and culturally adapt the English version of GMAS into the Nepalese version. The translated version was validated amongst patients with chronic diseases in Nepal. Exploratory factor analysis was carried out using principal component analysis with varimax rotation. TestCretest reliability and internal consistency were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 220 (53.6% females, and 51.4% of 51 to 70 aged patients) patients with chronic diseases participated in the study. The majority of patients took two medications (27.3%) from six months to five and half years (68.2%). Kaiser Meyer Olkin was found to be 0.83.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 on the intervals and outcomes of TACE in HCC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 154 HCC patients who underwent follow-up after TACE treatment from January 2020 to March 2020 (n = 71, study group) and January 2019 to March 2019 (n = 83, control group) at two institutions in China. The endpoints included the follow-up interval and overall response rate (ORR). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for a worse ORR. The cut-off point was determined to divide follow-up durations into long- and short-intervals. RESULTS: The median follow-up interval was 82.0 days (IQR, 61C109) in the study group, which was significantly longer than 66.0 days (IQR, 51C94) in the control group (P = 0.004). The ORR was 23.9 and 39.8% in the study and control group, respectively (P = 0.037). The cut-off value was 95 days.

Methods: Baseline demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved from medical records. Information of clinical manifestations, history of epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from February 13 to February 28 were collected. Literatures about pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and CNKI. Results: Among the 139 cancer patients who underwent chest CT scans before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients (5.8%), five of whom were characterized with GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative. One case was a 66-year-old man who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP chemotherapy regimen. His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes. This patient denied any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection, fever or other respiratory symptoms. Considering the negative result of nuclear acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed with viral pneumonia and an experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. Conclusions: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients. The epidemic history, clinical manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be taken into combined consideration. The 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applied in more selected patients.

Efficient recruitment of the 40S particle is particularly important for translation of mRNAs encoding oncoproteins and growth-promoting factors, which often harbor complex 5' UTRs and require efficient initiation. Thus, inhibiting the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction has emerged as a previously unpursued route for developing anticancer agents. Indeed, we discovered small-molecule inhibitors of this eIF4E/eIF4G interaction (4EGIs) that inhibit translation initiation both in vitro and in vivo and were used successfully in numerous cancer-biology and neurobiology studies. However, their detailed molecular mechanism of action has remained elusive. Here, we show that the eIF4E/eIF4G inhibitor 4EGI-1 acts allosterically by binding to a site on eIF4E distant from the eIF4G binding epitope. Data from NMR mapping and high-resolution crystal structures are congruent with this mechanism, where 4EGI-1 attaches to a hydrophobic pocket of eIF4E between -sheet2 (L60-T68) and -helix1 (E69-N77), causing localized conformational changes mainly in the H78-L85 region. It acts by unfolding a short 310-helix (S82-L85) while extending -helix1 by one turn (H78-S82). This unusual helix rearrangement has not been seen in any previous eIF4E structure and reveals elements of an allosteric inhibition mechanism leading to the dislocation of eIF4G from eIF4E.","output":"Structure of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E in complex with 4EGI-1 reveals an allosteric mechanism for dissociating eIF4G."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Advantages of midwife-led models of care have been reported; these include a higher vaginal birth rate and less interventions. In Germany, 98.4% of women are giving birth in obstetrician-led units. We compared the outcome of birth planned in alongside midwifery units (AMU) with a matched group of low-risk women who gave birth in obstetrician-led units. METHODS A prospective, controlled, multicenter study was conducted. Six of seven AMUs in North Rhine-Westphalia participated. Healthy women with a singleton term cephalic pregnancy booking for birth in AMU were eligible. For each woman in the study group a control was chosen who would have been eligible for birth in AMU but was booking for obstetrician-led care; matching for parity was performed. Mode of birth was chosen as primary outcome parameter. Secondary endpoints included a composite outcome of adverse outcome in the third stage and / or postpartum hemorrhage; higher-order obstetric lacerations; and for the neonate, a composite outcome (5-min Apgar < 7 and / or umbilical cord arterial pH < 7.10 and / or transfer to specialist neonatal care). Statistical analysis was by intention to treat. A non-inferiority analysis was performed. RESULTS Five hundred eighty-nine case-control pairs were recruited, final analysis was performed with 391 case-control pairs. Nulliparous women constituted 56.0% of cases. For the primary endpoint vaginal birth superiority was established for the study group (5.66%, 95%-CI 0.42% - 10.88%). For the composite newborn outcome (1.28%, 95%-CI -1.86% - -4.47%) and for higher-order obstetric lacerations (2.33%, 95%-CI -0.45% - 5.37%) non-inferiority was established. Non-inferiority was not present for the composite maternal outcome (-1.56%, 95%-CI -6.69% - 3.57%). The epidural anesthesia rate was lower (22.9% vs. 41.1%), and the length of hospital stay was shorter in the study group (p < 0.001 for both). Transfer to obstetrician-led care occurred in 51.2% of cases, with a strong association to parity (p < 0.001). Request for regional anesthesia was the most common cause for transfer (47.1%).

Here, we evaluated a dead-end hollow fiber ultrafilter (D-HFUF) for primary concentration, followed by the CP Select? for secondary concentration from 2L volumes of primary treated wastewater. Various amendments to each concentration procedure were investigated to optimally recover seeded OC43 (betacoronavirus) from wastewater. During primary concentration, the D-HFUF recovered 69  18% (n = 29) of spiked OC43 from 2L of wastewater. For secondary concentration, the CP Select? system using the Wastewater Application settings was capable of processing 100 mL volumes of primary filter eluates in <25 minutes.

The dose range varied substantially for capsules (14-146 mg) and tablets (24-201 mg). A higher dose (130 mg or greater) was found in 3.5% of MDMA tablets or capsules. Adulterants were identified in 14.1% of MDMA substances but only 1.6% contained a psychoactive adulterant and none presented as dangerous due to their nature or low concentration. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Dangerous MDMA adulterants or new psychoactive substances in tablet, capsule, powder or crystal forms (whether misrepresented as MDMA or not) were unlikely to be in circulation during the study period. Harm reduction messaging should inform that a key risk-factor for MDMA-related harm is the high and wide variation of purity and dose across forms. Market changes may have occurred since COVID-19, but continued monitoring will ensure messaging remains current.","output":"A quantitative analysis of MDMA seized at New South Wales music festivals over the 2019/2020 season: Form, purity, dose and adulterants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibiotic prescriptions make up a quarter of all prescriptions in Turkey. These locally 'ordinary' pharmaceutical commodities are used as tokens of care, enablers of treatment and legitimisers of illness to navigate in everyday healthcare infrastructures. Patients express embodied experiences of antibiotics circulating in their blood stream to reveal the abundance of antibiotic use in their medical histories. Yet access to antibiotics is becoming increasingly regulated, which is necessitating negotiations of care and trust amongst patient, doctors and pharmacists. Antibiotics, which for a long time have been reliable and easily accessible objects of care, are now proving less effective as treatment. With the growing concern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the over-the-counter sales of antibiotics have stopped in Turkey since 2015. Which means that antibiotics are only legally available through a doctor's prescription. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has recently limited doctor consultations, further restricting access to prescription medication. This paper explores the implications of the recent regulations and AMR on prescription practices, patient experiences and patient-doctor relationships within antibiotic infrastructures. The research draws on a three-month ethnographic fieldwork in Istanbul, Turkey, to understand negotiations of care and trust in processes of prescribing and acquiring antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic. The theoretical framework of the research is rooted in medical anthropology. Drawing on qualitative interviews with doctors, pharmacists and patients, as well as participant observation in an unfolding pandemic, this study shows that antibiotic prescription processes are becoming embedded in negotiations between patients, doctors and pharmacists. Moreover, despair amidst tension and uncertainty is increasing the contingency of navigating care and trust in the healthcare system to enable alternative ways of access to antibiotics.","output":"'Bleeding antibiotics': Negotiating care and trust in Turkish healthcare infrastructures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intensified disinfection of wastewater during the COVID-19 pandemic increased the release of toxic disinfection by-products (DBPs). However, studies relating to the ecological impacts of DBPs on the aquatic environment remain insufficient. In this study, we comparatively investigated the toxicities and ecological risks of 17 typical, halogenated DBPs to three trophic levels of organisms in the freshwater ecosystem, including phytoplankton (Scenedesmus sp.), zooplankton (Daphnia magna), and fish (Danio rerio). Toxicity of DBPs was found to be species-specific: Scenedesmus sp. was the most sensitive to haloacetic acids, while D. magna was the most sensitive to haloacetonitriles and trihalomethanes. Specific to each DBP, toxicities were also related to their classes and substituted halogen atoms. Damage to photosystems and oxidative stress served as the potential mechanisms for DBPs toxicity to microalgae. The different sensitivities to DBPs indicate that a battery of bioassays with organisms at different trophic levels is necessary to determine the ecotoxicity of DBPs. Furthermore, the ecological risks of DBPs were assessed by calculating the risk quotients (RQs) based on toxicity data from multiple bioassays. The cumulative RQs of DBPs to all the organisms were greater than 1.0, indicating high ecological risks of DBPs in wastewater effluents.","output":"Toxicity of 17 Disinfection By-products to Different Trophic Levels of Aquatic Organisms: Ecological Risks and Mechanisms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of pesticides is gradually increasing to improve the yield and quality of crops.

In 2014, approximately 6,000,000 people in the United States could benefit from PC, and this number is expected to increase over the next 25 years. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this review is to shed light on the significance of PC and provide a holistic view outlining both the benefits and existing barriers. METHODS A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify articles published in journals from 1948 to 2019. A narrative approach was used to search the grey literature. DISCUSSION Traditionally, the philosophy behind PC was based on alleviating suffering associated with terminal illnesses; PC was recommended only after other treatment options had been exhausted. However, the tenets of PC are applicable to anyone with a life-threatening illness as it is beneficial in conjunction with traditional treatments. It is now recognized that PC services are valuable when initiated alongside disease-modifying therapy early in the disease course. Studies have shown that PC decreased total symptom burden, reduced hospitalizations, and enabled patients to remain safely at home. CONCLUSION As the population ages and chronic illnesses become more widespread, there continues to be a growing need for PC programs. The importance of PC should not be overlooked despite existing barriers such as the lack of professional training and the cost of implementation. Education and open discussion play essential roles in the successful early integration of PC.","output":"Palliative Care: Too Good to Be True?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In 2020, the United States had approximately 85,000 new diagnoses of Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Food insecurity is both a direct and indirect detriment to health outcomes. The rate and risk factors for food insecurity among lymphoma patients are unknown, as the unemployment rate soars far above pre-COVID19 pandemic levels further heightening the economic stresses of a lymphoma diagnosis. METHODS Data regarding the food security status were obtained from the cross-sectional National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A raw score compiled from a series of 10 food security questions was used to determine the Food Secure and Food Insecure groups. Respondents who reported a history of lymphoma from 2011 to 2019 were included in the analysis. RESULTS Of the 921 patients reporting a history of lymphoma 9.06% were considered Food Insecure. The sociodemographic subgroups with the highest risk of being Food Insecure included respondents living below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level, non-US citizens, the uninsured, and those on Medicare. CONCLUSION Food insecurity is common among lymphoma patients. Therefore, oncologists across the country should be aware of the sociodemographic risk factors for food insecurity in order to assist in mediation, maximizing the efficacy of treatments.

In order to make unbiased comparisons between periodic orbits in this model and a traditional one where the contact rate switches based on more simplistic pointwise evaluations of active cases, we use a rigorous homotopy continuation method. We develop computer-assisted proofs that can validate the continuation and prove that the branch of periodic orbits has no folds and is isolated in the space of periodic solutions. This allows a direct, rigorous comparison between the geometric and quantitative properties of the cycles with a moving average threshold and a pointwise threshold.

As sequence databases continue to grow exponentially, it becomes increasingly important to repeat searches at frequent intervals, and similarity searches retrieve larger and larger sets of results. New and potentially significant results may be buried in a long list of previously obtained sequence hits from past searches. RESULTS: ReHAB (Recent Hits Acquired from BLAST) is a tool for finding new protein hits in repeated PSI-BLAST searches. ReHAB compares results from PSI-BLAST searches performed with two versions of a protein sequence database and highlights hits that are present only in the updated database. Results are presented in an easily comprehended table, or in a BLAST-like report, using colors to highlight the new hits. ReHAB is designed to handle large numbers of query sequences, such as whole genomes or sets of genomes. Advanced computer skills are not needed to use ReHAB; the graphics interface is simple to use and was designed with the bench biologist in mind.

The present study was aimed to better understand psychological status among medical staff and medical students during the early epidemic and to explore the influence factors of psychological distress. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online from February 2-14, 2020. We collected general information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents were assessed using the Kessler-6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Stepwise multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors influencing psychological distress. Results: Five hundred and twenty-eight respondents returned valid questionnaires. Medical staff and Medical students scored averages of 6.77 +/- 5.04, 15.48 +/- 8.66 on the K6, 37.22 +/- 11.39, 22.62 +/- 11.25 on the SSRS and 18.52 +/- 7.54, 28.49 +/- 11.17 on the PSS, respectively. Most medical staff (279, 91.77%) and 148 medical students (66.07%) showed a positive coping style. Social support, perceived stress, hours spent watching epidemic-related information per day and frequency of epidemic-related dreams were identified as factors influencing psychological distress among medical staff and medical students. Coping style emerged as a determinant of psychological distress among medical staff. Conclusions: In the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, medical staff and medical students were at moderate to high risk of psychological distress. Our results suggest that psychological interventions designed to strengthen social support, reduce perceived stress and adopt a positive coping style may be effective at improving the mental health of medical staff and medical students.","output":"Psychological Distress, Social Support, Coping Style, and Perceived Stress Among Medical Staff and Medical Students in the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Epidemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a member of the renin-angiotension system, however, the correlation between ACE2 and prognosis in UCEC (Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma) and KIRP (Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma) is not clear.

The correlation between ACE2 and immune infiltration level and the type markers of immune cells was investigated in TIMER database. A prognosis analysis based on the expression levels of ACE2 was further performed in related immune cells subgroup. The ACE2 promoter methylation profile was tested in the UALCAN database. In addition, we used GSE30589 and GSE52920 databases to elucidate the changes of ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro after SARS-CoV infection. ACE2 was elevated in UCEC and KIRP, and high ACE2 had a favorable prognosis. The expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with the level of immune infiltration of macrophage in KIRP, B cell, CD4+T cell, neutrophil and dendritic cell immune infiltration levels in UCEC. ACE2 was significantly positively correlated with the type markers of B cells and neutrophils, macrophages in UCEC, while ACE2 in KIRP was positively correlated with the type markers of macrophages. High ACE2 expression level had a favorable prognosis in different enriched immune cells subgroups in UCEC and KIRP.

The purpose of our work was to study the level of perceived stress in the context of the features of coping strategies in medical professionals with different practical experience (students, practicing doctors) in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The total number of study participants was 59 people, including 35 experienced medical workers aged 33 to 72 years (M=47,88;SD=9,44) and 24 medical students aged 20 to 29 years (M=24,16;SD=3,21) without professional experience, but who voluntarily went to work in the \\"red zones\\" during the pandemic.

From an action-research approach, the article analyzes how local stakeholders go beyond usual classical biosecurity issues to propose a territorialized preparedness. Mediating between Corsican farmers and the government representatives, a technical committee made up of actors from various regional research and development bodies drew up a socially acceptable preparedness proposal. Viewing the health risk from a local standpoint, the committee provided arguments for maintaining the extensive grazing that is non-negotiable for the farmers, while getting the farmers to agree to change other practices (reproduction control) as a measure against health hazards already present. Analysis of the preparedness process and the mediation process shows that a territorialized bottom-up approach to the governance of health risks can make biosecurity measures more acceptable to farmers. It also points to the legitimacy of a set of alternatives to top-down measures that standardize farming systems and may lead to the disappearance of small farmers and their traditional systems.","output":"From National Biosecurity Measures to Territorial ASF Preparedness: The Case of Free-Range Pig Farming in Corsica, France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A respiratory syndrome COVID-19 pandemic has become a serious public health issue nowadays.

Orally administered DOX@CMSWs could efficiently overcome the intestinal epithelium barrier (IEB), and resulted in satisfactory oral bioavailability of DOX (up to 348%). CMSWs were also proved to exhibit good biocompatibility and unique biodegradability. These findings displayed superior ability of CMSWs in crossing IEB through multiple topological mechanisms and would provide useful information on the rational design of nano-drug delivery systems.","output":"Chiral mesoporous silica nano-screws as an efficient biomimetic oral drug delivery platform through multiple topological mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suturing in space-confined surgical settings encountered during microsurgical procedures can be technically complex and time intensive. This paper presents the development of a new injector and new shape-memory alloy clip that can replace conventional suture. Engineering and surgical assessments of the injector and clips were performed. A prototype of the delivery system was tested in simulated surgical settings and compared to conventional suturing techniques for surgical time and wound strength. In various micro-surgical scenarios, the new injectable system proved to be 5 to 20-times more efficient and to have wound strengths over three-times that of conventional suturing. Further, the wounds closed by the shape-memory alloy clips could be forced to open and then recover to a watertight state, unlike conventional sutures which break upon failure. This new injector and shape-memory alloy clips proved to be quicker, stronger, and technically easier than conventional suturing.

However, there is no universal method and the technique depends on the local institutional resources and expertise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a simple new technique for the bedside placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube in an intensive care unit using palpation to confirm tube position. We studied 47 consecutive ventilated patients (mean body mass index 22.4  4.2 kg/m(2)) requiring enteral tube feeding for nutritional support. We monitored the maximum intensity point of injected air 'bubbling' by palpation and estimated tube position. We monitored the movement of the maximum intensity point from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant. If the maximum intensity point on the right upper quadrant diminished or weakened, we considered the tube had proceeded beyond the pylorus. By palpation, we could feel the bubbling of the injected air in all patients, but four patients were excluded because of failure to complete the protocol. The overall success rate including the four excluded cases was 85.1% (40/47) on the first attempt and 91.5% (43/47) when we included the second attempt. The median time for 40 successful tube placements on the first attempt was 10 (7 to 23) minutes.

The present work employs state of art computational methods like homology modelling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the potential of two widely used surfactant drugs namely chenodeoxycholate(CDC) and ursodeoxycholate (UDC), to bind to the envelope protein of SARS-Cov2(SARS-Cov2-E).The monomeric unit of SARS-Cov2-E was modelled from a close homologue (>90% sequence identity) and a pentameric assembly was modelled using symmetric docking, followed by energy minimization in a DPPC membrane environment. The minimized structure was used to generate best scoring SARS-Cov2-ECCDC/UDC complexes through blind docking. These complexes were subjected to 230 ns molecular dynamics simulations in triplicates in a DPPC membrane environment. Comparative analyses of structural properties and molecular interaction profiles from the MD trajectories revealed that, both CDC and UDC could stably bind to SARS-Cov2-E through H-bonds, water-bridges and hydrophobic contacts with the transmembrane-channelresidues.T30 was observed to be a key residue for CDC/UDC binding. CDC/UDC binding affected the H-bonding pattern between adjacent monomeric chains, slackening the compact transmembrane region of SARS-Cov2-E. Additionally, the polar functional groups of CDC/UDC facilitated entry of a large number of water molecules into the channel.

This phenomenon has not been well established during this SARS CoV2 pandemic. In this case series, we aim to evaluate patients admitted to our facility with new onset DM who had a history of COVID-19 infection. Method: This was a single center case series that included adult patients who presented to our facility with new onset DM during June-October 2020 who had a history of SARS CoV2 positive PCR and/or positive IgG antibody to SARS CoV2. Pregnant patients were excluded. Data was collected from the hospital electronic medical records. Diagnosis of diabetes was determined in these patients via hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) level greater than 6.5%. Results: Six patients fulfilled our diagnostic criteria. All patients were male with a median age of 54 years. The median BMI is 33.9, with 5 patients considered to be obese and 1 overweight. Other than the increased BMI, 2 patients with pre-DM and 3 patients who had a family history of DM, no other identifiable risk factors for DM were noted in this cohort. Five patients required hospitalization for HHS or DKA and 1 patient was managed as an outpatient. Median random serum glucose on presentation was 761.5 mg/dl and median HbA1C on presentation was 11.5%. Significant dosages of parenteral insulin (0.45 U/Kg) was required for hospitalized patients during their inpatient stay along with immediately after discharge to control their hyperglycemia. Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase and Islet Cell antibodies were done for 2 of the patients and were negative. Three of the patients who had follow up in 2 months showed improvement in their HbA1C (median of 7.1% [5.4C10.7]) and considerably diminished subcutaneous insulin requirement (0.2U/Kg). Two of these patients continued to follow up, and at 4 months from onset of DM, median HbA1C was 5.85% with insulin ceased. Of note, the patient who was lost to follow up was found to have an HbA1C improvement from 11.4% to 5.4% at the 2 month mark. Discussion: Both SARS CoV1 and SARS CoV2 activates the RAAS, causing insulin resistance by altering insulin signaling and increasing oxidative stress leading to dysfunction of pancreatic beta calls. The inflammatory cytokine storm response seen in COVID-19 can also decrease skeletal muscle sensitivity to insulin and decrease peripheral glucose uptake. These mechanisms may be leading to the new-onset DM noticed in our COVID-19 patients. In addition, there may be a possible immune-mediated mechanism given the matched time line between the COVID-19 antibody life span and the duration of DM. It is unknown whether this effect is permanent or temporary, although our results do support the latter. More studies that utilize a larger cohort and longer follow up are needed in order to get a better understanding of the mechanism of DM in COVID-19 infection.","output":"Covid-19 and New Onset Diabetes: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective intervention strategies are urgently needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. Patients and method In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n = 276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n = 152). Results The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (p < 0.0001), depression (p  0.05), anxiety (p  0.05), phobic anxiety (p < 0.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (p  0.043), and psychoticism (p  0.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. Conclusions The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.

We present short- and long-term post-operative outcomes from the largest single surgeon series of consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer. We describe the standardised laparoscopic technique developed by the principal surgeon, and the short-term outcomes from three surgeons who were trained in and subsequently adopted the same approach. METHODS Prospectively acquired data from consecutive patients undergoing surgery for rectal cancer by the principal surgeon at the minimally invasive colorectal unit in Portsmouth between 2006 and 2014 were analysed along with data acquired between 2010 and 2017 from surgeons at three further international centres. Endpoints were overall and disease-free survival at 5 years, and early post-operative clinical and pathological outcomes. RESULTS Two hundred sixty-three consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic TME surgery by the principal surgeon. At 5 years, overall survival was 82.9% (Dukes' A = 94.4%; B = 81.6%; C = 73.7%); disease-free survival was 84.0% (Dukes' A = 93.3%; B = 86.8%; C = 72.6%).

As recently reported, SARS-CoV-2 infections are not following this scheme, but they are rather characterized by incomplete avidity maturation. This study was performed to clarify whether infection with seasonal coronaviruses also leads to incomplete avidity maturation. The avidity of IgG toward the nucleoprotein (NP) of the seasonal coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1 and of SARS-CoV-2 was determined in the sera from 88 healthy, SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects and in the sera from 70 COVID-19 outpatients, using the recomLine SARS-CoV-2 assay with recombinant antigens. In the sera from SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects, incomplete avidity maturation (persistent low and intermediate avidity indices) was the lowest for infections with the alpha-coronaviruses 229E (33.3%) and NL63 (61.3%), and the highest for the beta-coronaviruses OC43 (77.5%) and HKU1 (71.4%). In the sera from COVID-19 patients, the degree of incomplete avidity maturation of IgG toward NP of 223E, OC43, and HKU1 was not significantly different from that found in SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects, but a significant increase in avidity was observed for IgG toward NP of NL63. Though there was no cross-reaction between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, higher concentrations of IgG directed toward seasonal coronaviruses seemed to indirectly increase avidity maturation of IgG directed toward SARS-CoV-2. Our data show that incomplete IgG avidity maturation represents a characteristic consequence of coronavirus infections. This raises problems for the serological differentiation between acute and past infections and may be important for the biology of coronaviruses.","output":"Incomplete IgG avidity maturation after seasonal coronavirus infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improper foot biomechanics associated with uneven bodyweight distribution contribute to impaired balance and fall risks. There is a need to complete the panel of commercially available devices for the self-measurement of BMI, fat, muscle, bone, weight, and hydration with one that measures weight-shifting at home as a pre-specialist assessment system. This paper reports the development of the Early Notice Pointer (ENP), a user-friendly screening device based on weighing scale technology. The ENP is designed to be used at home to provide a graphic indication and customised and evidence-based foot and posture triage. The device electronically detects and maps the bodyweight and distinct load distributions on the main areas of the feet: forefoot and rearfoot. The developed platform also presents features that assess the users balance, and the results are displayed as a simple numerical report and map. The technology supports data display on mobile phones and accommodates multiple measurements for monitoring. Therefore, the evaluation could be done at non-specialist and professional levels. The system has been tested to validate its accuracy, precision, and consistency. A parallel study to describe the frequency of arch types and metatarsal pressure in young adults (1034 healthy subjects) was conducted to explain the importance of self-monitoring at home for better prevention of foot arch- and posture-related conditions. The results showed the potential of the newly created platform as a screening device ready to be wirelessly connected with mobile phones and the internet for remote and personalised identification and monitoring of foot- and body balance-related conditions. The real-time interpretation of the reported physiological parameters opens new avenues toward IoT-like on-body monitoring of human physiological signals through easy-to-use devices on flexible substrates for specific versatility.","output":"Early Notice Pointer, an IoT-like Platform for Point-of-Care Feet and Body Balance Screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study is a meta-analysis of empirical studies in social media strategies and reputation research.

This method has not been widely adopted. We piloted the use of trained community health workers (CHW) to investigate the extent of unreported maternal and infant deaths in Khayelitsha and explored requirements of such a programme and the role of CHWs in bridging gaps. METHODS This was a mixed methods study, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods. Case identification and data collection were done by ten trained CHWs. Quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interview guides for key informant interviews, focus group discussions and informal conversations. Qualitative data were analysed thematically using a content analysis approach. RESULTS Although more than half of the infant deaths occurred in hospitals (n = 11/17), about a quarter that occurred at home (n = 4/17) were unreported. Main causes of deaths as perceived by family members of the deceased were related to uncertainty about the quality of care in the facilities, socio-cultural and economic contexts where people lived and individual factors. Most unreported deaths were further attributed to weak facility-community links and socio-cultural practices. Fragmented death reporting systems were perceived to influence the quality of the data and this impacted on the number of unreported deaths. Only two maternal deaths were identified in this pilot study. CONCLUSIONS CHWs can conduct verbal and social autopsy for maternal and infant deaths to complement formal vital registration systems. Capacity development, stakeholder's engagement, supervision, and support are essential for a community-linked death review system. Policymakers and implementers should establish a functional relationship between community-linked reporting systems and the existing system as a starting point.

Methods: The present study is aimed to screen ligands of herbal origin using rationale based bioprospection analysis and subsequently predict their binding potential subdue the major drug targets for novel Coronavirus by employing computer-aided virtual screening. Further, comparative analysis of the binding potential of an approved chemical analogue and selected herbal ligands were also predicted. The selection of receptors was performed based on their pathophysiological relevance, as assessed by a PubMed based keyword hits matrix analysis. The drug likeliness and ADMETox descriptors of 24 herbal ligands were computationally predicted. Docking studies were further conducted with those phytoligands that qualified these parameters. An existing antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, was also docked with all the selected viral receptors and its theoretical binding energy was set up as a standard for comparison as well as scrutinization of binding energies of the phytoligands. Results: The docking studies suggested that the herbal ligand, namely, gamma-glutamyl-S-allylcysteine demonstrated highly significant binding energies with viral spike glycoprotein, endoribonuclease and main protease (binding energy  -490 kcal/mol for all the tested viral receptors). Conclusion: Gamma-glutamyl-S-allylcysteine demonstrated more significant binding potential as compared to the known chemical analogue, i.e. , hydroxychloroquine, as observed in the computational docking studies.

METHOD: A series of 25 ICU patients with COVID-19 and signs of dysphagia were examined with fiberendoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) during the latter stage of ICU care or after discharge from the ICU. Swallowing function and laryngeal findings were assessed with standard rating scales from video recordings. RESULTS: Pooling of secretions was found in 92% of patients. Eleven patients (44%) showed signs of silent aspiration to the trachea on at least one occasion. All patients showed residue after swallowing to some degree both in the vallecula and hypopharynx. Seventy-six percent of patients had impaired vocal cord movement. Erythema of the vocal folds was found in 60% of patients and edema in the arytenoid region in 60%. CONCLUSION: Impairment of oropharyngeal swallowing function and abnormal laryngeal findings were common in this series of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in the ICU. To avoid complications related to dysphagia in this patient group, it seems to be of great importance to evaluate the swallowing function as a standard procedure, preferably at an early stage, before initiation of oral intake.

Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of international travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening-related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research to 13 November 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID-19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel (31 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low-certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID-19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. There was very low-certainty evidence that cross-border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID-19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) Screening measures covered symptom/exposure-based screening or test-based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. For symptom/exposure-based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low-certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. For test-based screening, one modelling study provided very low-certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low-certainty evidence). Quarantine (12 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low-certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low-certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure-based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness.

To mitigate these negative outcomes, the AAHA ICPB Guidelines Task Force believes that hospital teams should improve upon their current efforts by limiting pathogen exposure from entering or being transmitted throughout the hospital population and using surveillance methods to detect any new entry of a pathogen into the practice. To support these recommendations, these practice-oriented guidelines include step-by-step instructions to upgrade ICPB efforts in any hospital, including recommendations on the following: establishing an infection control practitioner to coordinate and implement the ICPB program; developing evidence-based standard operating procedures related to tasks performed frequently by the veterinary team (hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, phone triage, etc.); assessing the facility's ICPB strengths and areas of improvement; creating a staff education and training plan; cataloging client education material specific for use in the practice; implementing a surveillance program; and maintaining a compliance evaluation program. Practices with few or no ICPB protocols should be encouraged to take small steps.

The past pandemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) hint toward a risk of occurrence of \\"Long-COVID\\" syndrome, i.e., the persistence of post-discharge symptoms among COVID-19 survivors. With the scarcity of literature addressing post-COVID-19 manifestations and little regard for the stigma associated with this disease, survivors' rehabilitation remains widely neglected. The current study aims to assess the prevalence and characteristics of post-COVID-19 manifestations and their effect on the quality of life (QoL) of COVID-19 recovered individuals. We have also analyzed the relationship of time since the recovery of COVID-19 and its severity with the post-discharge symptoms. The stigma affiliated with the infection of SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has also been highlighted. Methodology A descriptive, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted from September 2020 to December 2020 among 158 COVID-19 recovered patients, whose information was obtained from Dow Diagnostic Laboratory, Ojha Campus, Karachi, Pakistan. The questionnaire consisted of four sections: sociodemographic data, post-COVID-19 manifestations, questions relating to the stigma, and the QoL of the recovered COVID-19 patients. We used the EuroQol five-dimension five-level questionnaire to assess the QoL, while the modified BG Prasad Socioeconomic Classification updated for 2019 was employed to determine the socioeconomic status of the participants. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Data were presented in the form of frequencies and percentages. Results An overwhelming majority (94.9%) experienced at least one post-COVID-19 symptom, with fatigue (82.9%) being the most prevalent post-discharge manifestation. We observed a significant correlation of post-COVID-19 symptoms with gender, age, and time since recovery. COVID-19 severity was found to be significantly related to the five dimensions of the QoL. A significant difference in EuroQol Visual Analog Scale health score was observed between the participants with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 infection (p < 0.001). Besides, the associated stigma with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to be more prevalent in the participants belonging to the upper class as compared to the other classes (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, we also observed a significant association of disease severity with post-COVID-19 manifestations and pre-existing comorbidities.

Previous studies have indicated that expression at the cellular level is heterogeneous, and that levels of expression may oscillate, conferring different cellular characteristics. In ES the role of EWSR1/FLI1 in regulating subpopulation dynamics is currently unknown. METHODS We used siRNA to transiently suppress EWSR1/FLI1 expression and followed population dynamics using both single cell expression profiling, CyTOF and functional assays to define characteristics of exponentially growing ES cells and of ES cells in which EWSR1/FLI1 had been downregulated. Novel transcriptional states with distinct features were assigned using random forest feature selection in combination with machine learning. Cells isolated from ES xenografts in immune-deficient mice were interrogated to determine whether characteristics of specific subpopulations of cells in vitro could be identified. Stem-like characteristics were assessed by primary and secondary spheroid formation in vitro, and invasion/motility was determined for each identified subpopulation. Autophagy was determined by expression profiling, cell sorting and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS We defined a workflow to study EWSR1/FLI1 driven transcriptional states and phenotypes. We tracked EWSR1/FLI1 dependent proliferative activity over time to discover sources of intra-tumoral diversity. Single-cell RNA profiling was used to compare expression profiles in exponentially growing populations (si-Control) or in two dormant populations (D1, D2) in which EWSR1/FLI1 had been suppressed. Three distinct transcriptional states were uncovered contributing to ES intra-heterogeneity. Our predictive model identified ~1% cells in a dormant-like state and ~ 2-4% cells with stem-like and neural stem-like features in an exponentially proliferating ES cell line and in ES xenografts. Following EWSR1/FLI1 knockdown, cells re-entering the proliferative cycle exhibited greater stem-like properties, whereas for those cells remaining quiescent, FAM134B-dependent dormancy may provide a survival mechanism. CONCLUSIONS We show that time-dependent changes induced by suppression of oncogenic EWSR1/FLI1 expression induces dormancy, with different subpopulation dynamics. Cells re-entering the proliferative cycle show enhanced stem-like characteristics, whereas those remaining dormant for prolonged periods appear to survive through autophagy. Cells with these characteristics identified in exponentially growing cell populations and in tumor xenografts may confer drug resistance and could potentially contribute to metastasis.","output":"Single-cell RNA profiling identifies diverse cellular responses to EWSR1/FLI1 downregulation in Ewing sarcoma cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to acute respiratory syndrome in patients, which can be due in part to dysregulated immune signalling We analyze here the occurrences of CpG dinucleotides, which are putative pathogen-associated molecular patterns, along the viral sequence Carrying out a comparative analysis with other ssRNA viruses and within the Coronaviridae family, we find the CpG content of SARS-CoV-2, while low compared to other betacoronaviruses, widely fluctuates along its primary sequence While the CpG relative abundance and its associated CpG force parameter are low for the spike protein (S) and comparable to circulating seasonal coronaviruses such as HKU1, they are much greater and comparable to SARS and MERS for the 3'-end of the viral genome In particular, the nucleocapsid protein (N), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3'UTRs of all subgenomic RNA, has high CpG content We speculate this dual nature of CpG content can confer to SARS-CoV-2 high ability to both enter the host and trigger pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in different contexts We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic Using a new application of selective forces on dinucleotides to estimate context driven mutational processes, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven both by the viral codon bias and by the high value of the CpG force in the N protein, leading to a loss in CpG content Sequence motifs preceding these CpG-loss-associated loci match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc Finger anti-viral Protein (ZAP) protein Funding: This work was partially supported by the ANR19 Decrypted CE30-0021-01 grants B G was supported by National Institutes of Health grants 7R01AI081848-04, 1R01CA240924-01, a Stand Up to Cancer - Lustgarten Foundation Convergence Dream Team Grant, and The Pershing Square Sohn Prize - Mark Foundation Fellow supported by funding from The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research","output":"The Heterogeneous Landscape and Early Evolution of Pathogen-Associated CpG Dinucleotides in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study evaluated fundus changes in a 6-year-old child who contracted Sars-CoV-2 without developing symptoms of the disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This institutional review board-approved retrospective study included 72 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with induction TPF chemotherapy in 2004-2010. CT texture and histogram analysis of the primary mass on the pretherapy CT images were performed by using TexRAD software before and after application of spatial filters at different anatomic scales ranging from fine detail to coarse features. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between overall survival and the baseline CT imaging measurements and clinical variables. RESULTS Primary mass entropy and skewness measurements with multiple spatial filters were associated with overall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis incorporating clinical and imaging variables indicated that primary mass size (hazard ratio [HR], 1.58 for each 1-cm increase; P = .018), N stage (HR, 8.77 for N3 vs N0 or N1; P = .002; HR, 4.99 for N3 vs N2; P = .001), and primary mass entropy (HR, 2.10 for each 0.5-unit increase; P = .036) and skewness (HR, 3.67 for each 1.0-unit increase; P = .009) measurements with the 1.0 spatial filter were independently associated with overall survival.

We here report that the in vitro anti-norovirus activity of the protease inhibitor rupintrivir is extended to murine noroviruses and that rupintrivir clears human cells from their Norwalk replicon after only two passages of antiviral pressure. In addition, we demonstrate that rupintrivir inhibits the human norovirus (genogroup II [GII]) protease and further explain the inhibitory effect of the molecule by means of molecular modeling on the basis of the crystal structure of the Norwalk virus protease. The combination of rupintrivir with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors 2'-C-methylcytidine and favipiravir (T-705) resulted in a merely additive antiviral effect. The fact that rupintrivir is active against noroviruses belonging to genogroup I (Norwalk virus), genogroup V (murine norovirus), and the recombinant 3C-like protease of a GII norovirus suggests that the drug exerts cross-genotypic anti-norovirus activity and will thus most likely be effective against the clinically relevant human norovirus strains.

The authors relied on unique governance variables extracted from the Bloomberg database to develop the governance deviance index.FindingsStudy unveils that deviance from governance practices influences firms performance. Consequently, it can be said that the firms which use innovative governance mechanisms, usually stay ahead of the market by leading the governance trends. The findings also generalise the firms entrepreneurial identity and organisational ecology perspectives.Research limitations/implicationsResearch implies that the firms entrepreneurial identity demands innovative managerial control. This study is focused on the US financial market, but in future, researchers could revalidate the deviance index.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the functioning of the healthcare sector, including dental services. The aim of this study was to analyse the behaviour of patients with regard to their use of dental services during the pandemic. The data were obtained from paper registration forms taken from five dental offices in the city of Cracow between March 2019 and February 2021. During the analysed periods, interest among first-time patients in dental services decreased to 37% (during the month when interest in dental services was at its lowest) compared to the year preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of cancelled visits increased by between 15% and 50% compared to the pre-pandemic period. During the pandemic, appointments made by existing patients increased by up to 84% compared to 2019. The decision by patients to postpone dental treatment not only has adverse effects on their oral and body health, but in turn results in higher health care costs.

METHODS: We used the self\\\\controlled case series method to assess the risks of clinically validated acute TTS after a first COVID\\\\19 vaccine dose (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) infection. Case ascertainment was performed uninformed of vaccination status via a retrospective clinical review of hospital EHR systems, including active ascertainment of thrombocytopenia. RESULTS: One hundred seventy individuals were admitted to the hospital for a TTS event at the study sites between January 1 and March 31, 2021. A significant increased risk (relative incidence [RI], 5.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02\\\\31.38) of TTS 4 to 27 days after ChAdOx1 was observed in the youngest age group (18\\\\ to 39\\\\year\\\\olds).

In 2018, Indonesia had a lower exclusive breastfeeding rate of 37% at 6 months postpartum; ranging from 20% to 56%, showing unequal breastfeeding support throughout the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (Ten Steps) in 1989, later embedded in UNICEFs Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) program in 1991. The BFHI aims to encourage maternity facilities worldwide to ensure adequate education and support for breastfeeding mothers by adhering to the Ten Steps and complying with the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes. An Indonesian survey in 2011 found that less than one in 10 government hospitals implemented the Ten Steps. It has been common for Indonesian health services to collaborate with infant formula companies. While no Indonesian hospitals are currently BFHI-accredited, the WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps (updated in 2018) have been adopted in Indonesias national regulation of maternity facilities since 2012. Internationally, implementation of the Ten Steps individually and as a package has been associated with benefits to breastfeeding rates and maternal and infant health. However, to date, few studies have examined the impact of implementing the Ten Steps in economic terms. This study aims to measure the economic benefit of Ten Steps implementation in an Indonesian hospital. Methods: The study was conducted in January 2020 in Airlangga University Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, which has implemented the Ten Steps since it was established in 2012. To understand and generate evidence on the social value of the Ten Steps, we conducted a Social Return on Investment (SROI) study of implementing the Ten Steps in this maternity facility. To estimate the costs relating to the Ten Steps we interviewed the financial and nursing managers, a senior pediatrician, and senior midwife due to their detailed understanding of the implementation of the Ten Steps in the hospital. The interview was guided by a questionnaire which we developed based on the 2018 WHO/UNICEF Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. The analysis was supported with peer-reviewed literature on the benefits of Ten Steps breastfeeding outcomes. Results: The total per annum value of investment (cost) required to implement Ten Steps in Airlangga University Hospital was US$ 972,303. The estimate yearly benefit was US$ 22,642,661. The social return on the investment in implementing Ten Steps in this facility was calculated to be US$ 49 (sensitivity analysis: US$ 18-65). Thus, for every US$ 1 invested in Ten Steps implementation by Airlangga Hospital could be expected to generate approximately US$ 49 of benefit. Conclusions: Investment in the Ten Steps implementation in this Surabaya maternity facility produced a social value 49 times greater than the cost of investment. This provides novel evidence of breastfeeding as a public health tool, demonstrating the value of the investment, in terms of social impact for mothers, babies, families, communities, and countries. Breastfeeding has the potential to help address inequity throughout the lifetime by providing the equal best start to all infants regardless of their background.

In addition to socio-demographics, domains assessed include occupational characteristics, COVID-19 related concerns, anxiety/depression, substance use, suicidality, lifestyle and family functioning. Of the 3083 HCWs who completed the survey (response rate-51.4 %), anxiety disorder and depression was highest among those with frontline COVID-19 responsibilities (anxiety disorder-26.6 %, depression-23.8 %). Prevalence was significantly higher among those with clinical responsibilities compared to those with supportive responsibilities (anxiety disorder: 23.9 % vs 15.5 %), (depression: 20.0 % vs 14.2 %). In the backward step-wise logistic regression analysis, HCWs with anxiety disorder were more likely to be doctors/nurses/hospital assistants, older, female, unmarried, without a leisure activity, report increased alcohol use and suicidal thoughts after pandemic onset, and having a history of receiving mental health interventions.

Through genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021, we identified the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, lineage P.1, that acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around early November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.4C2.2 times more transmissible and 25C61% more likely to evade protective immunity elicited by previous infection with non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.","output":"Genomics and epidemiology of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Manaus, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stent-assisted coiling may result in less aneurysm recanalization but more complications than coiling alone. We evaluated outcomes of coiling with and without stents in the multicenter Matrix and Platinum Science Trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients in the Matrix and Platinum Science Trial with unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated per protocol were included. Baseline patient and aneurysm characteristics, procedural details, neurologic outcomes, angiographic outcomes, and safety data were analyzed. RESULTS Overall, 137 of 361 (38%) patients were treated with a stent. Stent-coiled aneurysms had wider necks (4 mm in 62% with stents versus 33% without, P < .0001) and lower dome-to-neck ratios (1.3 versus 1.8, P < .0001). Periprocedural serious adverse events occurred infrequently in those treated with and without stents (6.6% versus 4.5%, P = .39). At 1 year, total significant adverse events, mortality, and worsening of mRS were similar in treatment groups, but ischemic strokes were more common in stent-coiled patients than in coiled patients (8.8% versus 2.2%, P = .005). However, multivariate analysis confirmed that at 2 years after treatment, prior cerebrovascular accident (OR, 4.7; P = .0089) and aneurysm neck width 4 mm (OR, 4.5; P = .02) were the only independent predictors of ischemic stroke. Stent use was not an independent predictor of ischemic stroke at 2 years (OR, 1.1; P = .94). Stent use did not predict target aneurysm recurrence at 2 years, but aneurysm dome size 10 mm (OR, 9.94; P < .0001) did predict target aneurysm recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Stent-coiling had similar outcomes as coiling despite stented aneurysms having more difficult morphology than coiled aneurysms. Increased ischemic events in stent-coiled aneurysms were attributable to baseline risk factors and aneurysm morphology.","output":"Stent-assisted coiling versus coiling alone in unruptured intracranial aneurysms in the matrix and platinum science trial: safety, efficacy, and mid-term outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: To better understand the timing of when people buckle their seat belt, an analysis of a naturalistic driving study was used. The study provided a unique perspective inside of the vehicle where the entire seat belt was visible from the time the driver entered the vehicle to one minute of driving forward or 32a?kph. METHOD: Seat belt buckling behavior was identified for 30 drivers. An additional 10 drives for 13 of these drivers were identified for a seat belt sequencing, which identified the points when the vehicle was put into ignition, shifted, when vehicle movement began, and when the seat belt was buckled. The speed at belt closure was also identified. The timing from ignition to buckle and to shifting into forward gear were examined to identify the speed and appropriate timing for seat belt reminders. RESULTS: The data show that drivers were buckled in over 92% of the 3,102 drives. In addition, in 70% of those total drives, the drivers were buckled before the vehicle began movement. Of greater interest for seat belt reminders/interlocks are those drives when drivers buckle after movement. When considering time from ignition to seat belt closure, the mean was 27.5a?s. Because higher speeds are typically reached when traveling forward rather than reverse, it was important to know the time duration from shifting into drive to buckling. With this consideration, the mean to buckle dropped to 16.2a?s. The mean speed at buckling when traveling forward was 15.3a?kph. From the regression analysis, the input variables 'Age,' 'Sex,' 'Weight,' 'Environment,' and 'Weather' are significant contributors in predicting the log odds of a driver putting on seatbelt. CONCLUSIONS: With the understanding that higher speeds lead to an increased risk of injury and/or death and with the results of the analysis, a recommendation of a 30a?s time from forward shift and a 25a?kph (6.9a?m/s) threshold for reminder systems should be implemented. The regression analysis also validates that most of the predicted seat belt buckling times are within 30a?s. Practical Applications: This would reduce perception of nuisance alerts and protect the driver from higher speed unbuckled crashes. The seat belt buckling time prediction model also demonstrates good potential for developing tailored buckling warning system for different drivers.","output":"Quantifying and recommending seat belt reminder timing using naturalistic driving video data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is primarily caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been a challenge to the clinician.

SARS-CoV-2 infection alters multiple signal transduction pathways that are critical for cell survival. The virus causes a severe and prolonged period of hypercytokinemia with misusing of these signaling cascades. Hyperactivation of the host immune system after infection with SARS-CoV-2 is the main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. Thus, to develop effective therapeutic approaches, it is necessary to first understand the problem and the underlying molecular pathways implicated in host immunological function/dysfunction. A number of intracellular signaling cascades have been implicated in infected cell pathways, including MAPK pathway, NF-B pathway, JAKCSTAT signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and TLRI signaling cascades.

First, social distancing, rational use of face masks and respirators, eye protection, and hand disinfection for medical staff and the general public deserve further attention and promotion. Second, aerodynamic characteristics, such as size distribution, release regularity, aerosol diffusion, survival and decline, infectious dose and spread distance, still require further investigation in order to identify the transmissibility of COVID-19. Third, background monitoring of the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms and environmental disinfection in crowded public places, such as railway stations, schools, hospitals and other densely populated areas, can give early warning of outbreaks and curb the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in those high-risk areas.

At a later stage direct detection can be achieved in samples from the lower airway or a stool or anal swab. Antigen or antibody tests cannot replace the direct detection of the pathogen; however, the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies are of special interest for epidemiological questions (seroconversion time of sometimes several weeks). The plaque reduction neutralization test exclusively detects antibodies which neutralize viruses but the procedure is complicated.

METHODS: In a single urban tertiary care center, a retrospective study examined the first complete lockdown period of Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was compared to the same time period the previous year. RESULTS: During the pandemic, time to hospitalization was significantly decreased. There was also an overall reduction in surgical admissions yet with a higher percentage being hospitalized for further treatment (69.2% vs 23.5%). The patients admitted during this time had a higher APACHE-II score and Charlson comorbidity index score. During the pandemic, time to surgery was decreased, there were less laparoscopic procedures, and more RBC units were used per patient. There were no differences in overall complications, except when sub-analyzed for major complications (9.7% vs 6.3%). There was no significant difference in overall in-house mortality or morbidity.

AIMS: To build a rigorous understanding what childcare strategies are used and why in a typical Nairobi slum, with a particular focus on provision and quality of paid childcare. Through this, to inform evaluation of quality and design and implementation of interventions with the potential to reach some of the most vulnerable children at the most critical time in the life course. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Mixed methods will be employed. Qualitative research (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions) with parents/carers will explore need for and decision-making about childcare. A household survey (of 480 households) will estimate the use of different childcare strategies by parents/carers and associated parent/carer characteristics. Subsequently, childcare providers will be mapped and surveyed to document and assess quality of current paid childcare. Semistructured observations will augment self-reported quality with observable characteristics/practices. Finally, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with childcare providers will explore their behaviours and motivations. Qualitative data will be analysed through thematic analysis and triangulation across methods. Quantitative and spatial data will be analysed through epidemiological methods (random effects regression modelling and spatial statistics). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted in the UK and Kenya. Findings will be disseminated through journal publications, community and government stakeholder workshops, policy briefs and social media content.","output":"Nairobi Early Childcare in Slums (NECS) Study Protocol: a mixed-methods exploration of paid early childcare in Mukuru slum, Nairobi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computer mediated conversations (e.g., videoconferencing) is now the new mainstream media. How would credibility be impacted if one could change their race on the fly in these environments? We propose an approach using Deepfakes and a supporting GAN architecture to isolate visual features and alter racial perception. We then crowd-sourced over 800 survey responses to measure how credibility was influenced by changing the perceived race. We evaluate the effect of showing a still image of a Black person versus a still image of a White person using the same audio clip for each survey. We also test the effect of showing either an original video or an altered video where the appearance of the person in the original video is modified to appear more White. We measure credibility as the percent of participant responses who believed the speaker was telling the truth. We found that changing the race of a person in a static image has negligible impact on credibility. However, the same manipulation of race on a video increases credibility significantly (61\\\\% to 73\\\\% with p $<$ 0.05). Furthermore, a VADER sentiment analysis over the free response survey questions reveals that more positive sentiment is used to justify the credibility of a White individual in a video.","output":"Could you become more credible by being White?

Self-reported empathy varies across cultures and there are differing reports of associations with demographic characteristics. We therefore aimed in a UK survey to characterise two main self-reported components of empathy, namely empathic concern (feeling compassion) and perspective taking (understanding others perspective). We hypothesised that empathy would be associated with age, gender, ethnicity, relationship status, employment, socio-economic status, education, and personality.MethodsWe asked participants in the COVID-19 Social Study - an internet-based survey of UK-dwelling adults aged 18 years - to complete the Interpersonal Reactivity Index subscales measuring empathic concern and perspective taking, and sociodemographic and personality questionnaires. We weighted the sample to be UK population representative and employed multivariable weighted linear regression models.ResultsIn 30,033 respondents, mean empathic concern score was 3.86 (95% confidence interval 3.85, 3.88) and perspective taking was 3.57 (3.56. 3.59), the correlation between these subscores was 0.45 (p <0.001). In adjusted models, greater empathic concern was associated with female gender, non-white ethnicity, having more education, working in health, social-care, or childcare professions, and having higher neuroticism, extroversion, openness to experience and agreeableness traits. Perspective taking was associated with younger age, female gender, more education, employment in health or social-care, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness.ConclusionsWomen and people working in caring professions have higher empathy levels. Perspective taking declines with age but empathic concern does not.

Method: This was a clustered cross-sectional study conducted from July 12 to August 20, 2021, in households in the city of Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic. Information regarding demographic characteristics (age, gender, and place of residence), comorbidities (chronic diseases) was collected. A venous blood sample was obtained for each participant to determine the level of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a WANTAI SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA kit. Results: All up, 799 participants were surveyed. The average age was 27 years, and 45.8% of the respondents were male (sex ratio: 0.8). The overall proportion of respondents with a positive serostatus was 74.1%. Participants over 20 years of age were twice as likely to have a positive serostatus, with an OR of 2.2 (95% CI: [1.6, 3.1]). Interpretation: The results of this survey revealed a high cumulative level of immunity in Bangui, thus indicating a significant degree of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population.

STUDY DESIGN: Diagnosis of MIS-C like disease was pursued after echocardiography showed severely depressed ventricular function and pathological coronary artery dilation in the setting of medically refractory multisystem organ failure and maternal COVID-19 infection. The neonate did not respond to standard medical therapy, and there was no alternative disease that could explain the clinical course. High index of clinical suspicion coupled with low risk of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prompted us to pursue IVIG administration even though the neonate did not meet classic criteria for MIS-C. RESULT: Following treatment with IVIG, there was rapid clinical improvement. Ventricular function improved within 15 hours and coronary artery dilation resolved in 8 days. There was no recurrence of disease during follow-up. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 associated MIS-C like disease has not been well described in neonates. As typical features may be conspicuously absent, a high index of suspicion is warranted in critically ill neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Echocardiography may provide critical diagnostic information and narrow the differential diagnosis. KEY POINTS:  COVID-19 associated MIS-C can present in neonates..

This study describes patrol officers knowledge of their states GSL, experience with OD response, and their perspectives on strategies to prevent and respond to opioid OD. Methods An electronic survey assessed officers knowledge of state GSLs and experiences responding to OD. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical linear modeling were generated to examine differences in knowledge, preparedness, and endorsement of OD response efforts by experience with OD response. Results 2,829 officers responded to the survey. Among those who had responded to an OD call in the past six months (n = 1,946), 37% reported administering naloxone on scene and 36% reported making an arrest. Most (91%) correctly reported whether their state had a GSL in effect. Only 26% correctly reported whether that law provides limited immunity from arrest. Fifteen percent of officers who had responded to an OD work in departments that do not carry naloxone. Compared with officers who had not responded to any OD calls, those who reported responding OD calls at least monthly and at least weekly, were significantly less likely to endorse OD response efforts. Conclusion Officers who respond to OD calls are generally receiving training and naloxone supplies to respond, but knowledge gaps and additional training needs persist.

In particular, current guidelines and policies have highlighted the need to use high level Personal Protective Equipment to reduce the risk of viral infection during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. In particular, it was felt that the laparoscopic approach was at higher risk of viral transmission due to the chimney effect of the smoke escape from the trocars during and after the procedure. However, with this being a new and largely unknown viral agent, guidelines have been based on speculation and extrapolation from previous studies conducted in completely different situations, and led to anxiety amongst surgeons and theatre staff. We decided to conduct a systematic review of the Literature to try to clarify whether inhalation of surgical smoke can increase the risk of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A thorough search of the relevant Literature was performed following the PRISMA guidelines and the most relevant papers on this topic were selected for qualitative analysis. Duplicates, review, personal opinions and guidelines have been excluded. Quantitative analysis has not been performed due to the lack of homogeneous high-quality studies. RESULTS: Literature search identified 740 papers but only 34 of them were suitable for qualitative analysis. The quality of those studies is generally quite low. We were not able to find any evidence directly linking surgical smoke with viral transmission, other than in patients with active HPV infection. DISCUSSION: Inhalation of surgical smoke can be generally hazardous, and therefore the use of PPE during surgical operations must be recommended in any case. However, the present systematic review of the existent Literature did not identify any significant evidence of the risk of viral transmission with the surgical smoke, therefore the current guidelines restricting the use of laparoscopy and/or diathermy during the current Covid-19 pandemic may be considered excessive and non-evidence based.","output":"COVID-19 infection risk by open and laparoscopic surgical smoke: A systematic review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hyperuricosuria is associated with kidney stone disease, especially uric acid (UA) and calcium oxalate (CaOx) types. Nevertheless, detailed mechanisms of hyperuricosuria-induced kidney stone formation remained unclear.

Quantitative proteomics using 2-DE followed by nanoLC-ESI-ETD MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry revealed significant changes in levels of 22 proteins in the UA-treated cells. These proteomic data could be confirmed by Western blotting. Functional assays revealed an increase in intracellular ATP level and enhancement of tissue repairing capability in the UA-treated cells. Interestingly, levels of HSP70 and HSP90 (the known receptors for CaOx crystals) were increased in apical membranes of the UA-treated cells. CaOx crystal-cell adhesion assay revealed significant increase in CaOx-binding capability of the UA-treated cells, whereas neutralization of the surface HSP70 and/or HSP90 using their specific monoclonal antibodies caused significant reduction in such binding capability. These findings highlighted changes in renal tubular cells in response to high-dose UA that may, at least in part, explain the pathogenic mechanisms of hyperuricosuria-induced mixed kidney stone disease.","output":"Effects of high-dose uric acid on cellular proteome, intracellular ATP, tissue repairing capability and calcium oxalate crystal-binding capability of renal tubular cells: Implications to hyperuricosuria-induced kidney stone disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Persistent lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS) is one of the most common reasons for poor postoperative outcomes and is a major contributor to \\"failed back surgery syndrome.\\" The authors describe a new surgical strategy for LFS based on anatomical considerations using 3D image fusion with MRI/CT analysis. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 78 consecutive patients surgically treated for LFS at the lumbosacral junction (2013-2017). The location and extent of stenosis, including the narrowest site and associated pathology (bone or soft tissue), were measured using 3D image fusion with MRI/CT. Stenosis was defined as medial intervertebral foraminal (MF; inner edge to pedicle center), lateral intervertebral foraminal (LF; pedicle center to outer edge), or extraforaminal (EF; outside the pedicle). Lumbar (low-back pain, leg pain) and patient satisfaction visual analog scale (VAS) scores and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores were evaluated. Surgical outcome was evaluated 2 years postoperatively. RESULTS: Most instances of stenosis existed outside the pedicle's center (94%), including LF (58%), EF (36%), and MF (6%). In all MF cases, stenosis resulted from soft-tissue structures. The narrowest stenosis sites were localized around the pedicle's outer border. The areas for sufficient nerve decompression were extended in MF+LF (10%), MF+LF+EF (14%), LF+EF (39%), LF (11%), and EF (26%). No iatrogenic pars interarticularis damage occurred. The JOA score was 14.9  2.6 points preoperatively and 22.4  3.5 points at 2 years postoperatively. The JOA recovery rate was 56.0%  18.6%. The VAS score (low-back and leg pain) was significantly improved 2 years postoperatively (p < 0.01).

Nine patients (11.5%) selected \\"I did not improve as much as I had hoped but I would undergo the same surgery for the same outcome.\\" CONCLUSIONS: Most LFS existed outside the pedicle's center and was rarely noted in the pars region. The main regions of stenosis were localized to the pedicle's outer edge. Considering this anatomical distribution of LFS, the authors recommend that lateral fenestration should be the first priority for foraminal decompression. Other surgical options including foraminotomy, total facetectomy, and hemilaminectomy likely require more bone resections than LFS treatment. The microendoscopic surgery results were very good, indicating that this minimally invasive surgery was suitable for treating this disease.","output":"Microendoscopic decompression for lumbosacral foraminal stenosis: a novel surgical strategy based on anatomical considerations using 3D image fusion with MRI/CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding the global epidemic trends, geographic distribution, and transmission patterns of COVID-19 contribute to providing timely information for the global response of the epidemic.

The psychological outcomes of students who relocated during the pandemic remains unknown. We examined mandated relocation experiences related to self-reported worry, grief, loneliness, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data obtained from April 9 to August 4, 2020 on 791 young adults (ages 18-30 years) who were enrolled at a U.S. university. The CARES 2020 Project (COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study) is an online survey of young adults' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment relied on snowball sampling. Participants were asked if they were required to relocate from campus and among those who did, their experiences in moving. COVID-19-related worry and grief, loneliness, and depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms were assessed. RESULTS: Approximately one-third of students reported being mandated to relocate. Students mandated to relocate reported more COVID-19-related grief, loneliness, and generalized anxiety symptoms compared to those who did not even after controlling for the severity level of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Students who had to leave behind valuable personal belongings reported more COVID-19-related worries, grief, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and PTSD symptoms.

We aimed to identify factors influencing clinicians decision on treatment modification during the initial phase of the pandemic, and to assess its impact on outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer. Patients and Methods Electronic records of patients seen in a large UK tertiary cancer centre were reviewed. The frequency and type of changes to systemic anticancer therapy (SACT), as well as the factors predicting clinicians decision were assessed. Results A total of 418 patients; mean age 6312 years and 57% male were included. More than half of the patients had modification to their treatment; with treatment delay (21%) or cancellation (10%), being the most common. Majority of patients on neoadjuvant treatment (97%) proceeded with treatment, with some form of treatment modification in 20%. Half of patients on adjuvant treatment had their treatment plan modified. Overall, a change in treatment was more likely in older patients [OR 1.028 (95% CI 1.010C1.047); p=0.002], and in patients who had already received higher number of cycles of SACT [OR 1.040 (95% CI 1.016C1.065); p=0.001]. A change in treatment was less likely further out of the first national lockdown [OR 0.837 (95% CI 0.758C0.925); p<0.001]. Patients on third-line treatment were most likely to have alterations to their treatment plan (69%, n=33/48).

This research analyses the nature, intensity, and type of pre-service teachers use of such for educational purposes in their initial training in order to detect the most important aspects for improvement. Possible factors shaping behaviour were gender, whether individuals belonged to universities operating online or in person, differences in the types of studies they were undertaking, and the time at which the questionnaire was administered, before or after the COVID-19 health crisis.

To do so, we administered a questionnaire to a total of 812 students from 6 Spanish universities. The results show a preference for WhatsApp, YouTube, and Instagram. In addition, it was found that undergraduate students used them more intensively than postgraduate students. In the case of online universities, there was a greater need to cover affective and emotional aspects than in in-person universities. As in almost all areas, the situation caused by COVID-19 changed the way social networks were used.

With the advancement of technology and the widespread availability of medical data, CAD has gotten a lot of attention, and numerous methods for predicting different pathological diseases have been created. Ultrasound (US) is the safest clinical imaging method; therefore, it is widely utilized in medical and healthcare settings with computer-aided systems. However, owing to patient movement and equipment constraints, certain artefacts make identification of these US pictures challenging. To enhance the quality of pictures for classification and segmentation, certain preprocessing techniques are required. Hence, we proposed a three-stage image segmentation method using U-Net and Iterative Random Forest Classifier (IRFC) to detect orthopedic diseases in ultrasound images efficiently. Initially, the input dataset is preprocessed using Enhanced Wiener Filter for image denoising and image enhancement. Then, the proposed segmentation method is applied. Feature extraction is performed by transform-based analysis. Finally, obtained features are reduced to optimal subset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The classification is done using the proposed Iterative Random Forest Classifier. The proposed method is compared with the conventional performance measures like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and dice score.

We experimentally show that unauthorized access to the location reports allows for accurate device tracking and retrieving a user's top locations with an error in the order of 10 meters in urban areas. While we find that OF's design achieves its privacy goals, we discover two distinct design and implementation flaws that can lead to a location correlation attack and unauthorized access to the location history of the past seven days, which could deanonymize users.

Although measures to control SARS-CoV-2, namely, vaccination, medication, and chemical disinfectants are being investigated, there is an increase in the demand for auxiliary antiviral approaches using natural compounds. Here we have focused on hydroxytyrosol (HT)-rich aqueous olive pulp extract (HIDROX?) and evaluated its SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activity in vitro. We showed that the HIDROX solution exhibits time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities, and that HIDROX has more potent virucidal activity than pure HT. The evaluation of the mechanism of action suggested that both HIDROX and HT induced structural changes in SARS-CoV-2, which changed the molecular weight of the spike proteins. Even though the spike protein is highly glycosylated, this change was induced regardless of the glycosylation status. In addition, HIDROX or HT treatment disrupted the viral genome. Moreover, the HIDROX-containing cream applied on film showed time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities. Thus, the HIDROX-containing cream can be applied topically as an antiviral hand cream. Our findings suggest that HIDROX contributes to improving SARS-CoV-2 control measures.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2-Inactivating Activity of Hydroxytyrosol-Rich Aqueous Olive Pulp Extract (HIDROX?) and Its Use as a Virucidal Cream for Topical Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To guide the development of support programmes, this review sought to aggregate and synthesise qualitative studies to establish a comparative understanding of the experiences of healthcare staff caring for persons with the disease. DESIGN: A meta-ethnography approach was used to aggregate and synthesise primary qualitative studies. Database search was undertaken from January to November 2020. A standardised tool was used to extract data from the identified primary studies. The studies were translated into each other to formulate overarching concepts/ metaphors which formed the basis of undertaking a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Eight qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Two overarching metaphors/ concepts were formulated from the primary studies: 1) surviving to thriving in an evolving space and 2) support amid the new normal. The initial phase of entering the space of caring during the outbreak was filled with psychological chaos as healthcare staff struggled to survive within the context of an illness which was not fully understood. Gradually, healthcare staff may transition to a thriving phase characterised by resilience but still experienced heavy workload and physical/ emotional exhaustion predisposing them to burnout and compassion fatigue. Fear persisted throughout their experiences: fear of contracting the disease or infecting ones family members/ loved ones remained a key concern among healthcare staff despite infection precaution measures. Healthcare staff who contracted the disease felt isolated with additional fears of dying alone. The sources of support were varied with a strong emphasis on peer support. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare staff caring for persons infected with the Coronavirus disease are at risk of burnout and compassion fatigue and require ongoing mental health support commensurate to their needs. Staff who contract the disease may require additional support to navigate through the illness and recovery. Policies and concerted efforts are needed to strengthen support systems and build resilience among healthcare staff.","output":"Surviving to thriving: a meta-ethnography of the experiences of healthcare staff caring for persons with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This discussion piece considers some of the potential consequences for international taxation of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic recession It considers tax measures that states may wish to take, as well as the impact on the institutional structure of international taxation and the way in which we do international taxation It considers the introduction of excess profit taxes and progressive wealth taxes, as well as changes to the OECD agenda Finally, it considers whether some of the new ways of working developed during lock-down will have long-term implications for international taxation","output":"International Tax in the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of the respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is stimulating an unprecedented scientific campaign to alleviate the burden of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). One line of research has focused on targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins fundamental for its replication by repurposing drugs approved for other diseases. The first interaction between the virus and the host cell is mediated by the spike protein on the virus surface and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). Small molecules able to bind the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and disrupt the binding to ACE2 would offer an important tool for slowing, or even preventing, the infection. Here, we screened 2421 approved small molecules in silico and validated the docking outcomes through extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Out of six drugs characterized as putative RBD binders, the cephalosporin antibiotic cefsulodin was further assessed for its effect on the binding between the RBD and ACE2, suggesting that it is important to consider the dynamic formation of the heterodimer between RBD and ACE2 when judging any potential candidate.

The need to study readmission patterns is even bigger during a pandemic because the burden is further stretching the healthcare system. METHODS We reviewed the initial hospitalization and subsequent readmission for 19 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest statewide hospital network in Rhode Island, US, from March 1st through April 19th , 2020. We also compared the characteristics and clinical outcomes between readmitted and non-readmitted patients. RESULTS Of the 339 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 279 discharged alive. Among them, 19/279 were readmitted (6.8%) after a median of 5 days. There was a significantly higher rate of hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, cancer, and substance abuse among the readmitted compared to non-readmitted patients. The most common reasons of readmissions happening within 12 days from discharge included respiratory distress and thrombotic episodes, while those happening at a later time included psychiatric illness exacerbations and falls. The length of stay during readmission was longer than during index admission and more demanding on healthcare resources. CONCLUSION Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, those readmitted had a higher burden of comorbidities than the non-readmitted. Within the first 12 days from discharge, readmission reasons were more likely to be associated with COVID-19, while those happening later were related to other reasons.

To enable effective responses to these pathogens in the event that they undergo future emergence, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is advancing the development of vaccines for several pathogens prioritized by the World Health Organization. A major challenge in this pursuit is anticipating demand for a vaccine stockpile to support outbreak response. We developed a modeling framework for outbreak response for emerging zoonoses under three reactive vaccination strategies. Annual vaccine regimen requirements for a population-wide strategy ranged from >670,000 (95% prediction interval: 0-3,630,000) for Lassa virus to 1,190,000 (95% PrI: 0-8,480,000) for Rift Valley fever virus, while the regimens required for ring vaccination or targeting healthcare workers (HCWs) were several orders of magnitude lower. For each pathogen and vaccination strategy, reactive vaccination typically prevented fewer than 10% of cases, because of their presently low R0 values. Targeting HCWs had a higher per-regimen impact than population-wide vaccination.

PATIENTS AND METHODS We searched the electronic health record between 2000 and 2020 at our center to characterize the volume, clinical settings, and outcomes associated with off-label use of targeted therapies in different types of solid tumors. RESULTS Among 46,712 patients who received targeted therapies, we identified 119 instances of off-label use of targeted therapy. Colon cancer was the most common cancer type to receive off-label targeted therapy in 18 patients (15.1%), followed by 13 with non-small-cell lung cancer (10.9%), eight with cholangiocarcinoma (6.7%), and seven with glioblastoma (5.9%). The most frequent molecular rationale for off-label therapy came from a comprehensive next-generation sequencing test (53.7%). The most frequently mutated gene that provided the rationale for targeted therapy was BRAF (20.1%), with BRAFV600E being the most common molecular alteration overall (15.1%). The median duration of off-label targeted therapy was 3.58 months, and the overall survival of treated patients was 7.59 months.

In fact, knowledges of pathophysiology of this new disease are still in development and hence originate discussions and interpretations. Regarding the role of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, these mechanisms should be considered as crucial especially in severe cases. It is proposed to consider two distinct phenotypes of thrombotic manifestations: the current thromboembolic type also occurring in other kinds of sepsis, and the diffuse micro-thrombotic type, prevailing in the lungs but sometimes extending to other organs. Both types can induce severe disease and are potentially lethal. The micro-thrombotic pattern, more specific for COVID-19, results from a massive activation of coagulation strictly coupled with a hyper-intense inflammatory and immune reaction. This results in widespread occlusive thrombotic micro-angiopathy with destruction of alveoli and obstructive neoangiogenesis. The involvement of fibrinolysis, often neglected, confers a double faceted process of activation/inhibition, finally conducive to a fibrinolytic shutdown that reinforces persistence of micro-thrombi. Considering these peculiar mechanisms, it seems evident that both prophylactic and therapeutic effects of current anti-thrombotic drugs cannot be taken for granted and need therefore new specific and rigorous controlled trials.","output":"COVID-19: The crucial role of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Preliminary empirical data indicates a substantial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and mental health.

METHODS: We collated data from our Tertiary care hospital for two periods, i.e. from 25th March 2020 to 3rd May 2020 signifying strict lockdown and then from 4th May to 31st May during which some conditional relaxations were given. This was compared to data from similar periods in 2019. We looked at patient demographics, fracture types, injury mechanisms, and even changes in treatment protocols. RESULTS: Significant reductions in caseloads were noted; open injuries were less, road accidents were infrequent, but cases due to falls, especially children and the elderly were still seen, although slightly reduced. The plan to minimize operative interventions could not be fully implemented due to complex nature of trauma seen by us. Only one case of bilateral amputation turned out to be positive, with no infectious consequences to the treating staff.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study carried out with 198 first-time mothers aged 22C48 who completed self-report questionnaires on April 2020 and again on October 2020. The questionnaire was distributed through social networks and included a demographic scale and the COVID-19-related anxieties questionnaire. FINDINGS: In the first phase, mothers reported higher anxieties concerning economic damage (M = 3.42; 3.11), being in public places (M = 4.34; M = 3.51), using public transportation (M = 4.80; M = 4.31), and going for infant checkups (M = 4.13; M = 3.06). In the second phase, mothers reported higher anxiety about being infected (M = 3.19; M = 3.48). DISCUSSION: The results suggest the need to be attentive to the double stress of new mothers in a dynamic time of crisis, especially at the beginning of the crisis when anxiety levels may be highest.

The finding that the COVID-19-related anxieties of new mothers may decrease over time points to the urgency of making interventions by health and medical professionals available to women in the first months after the birth of their first child.","output":"COVID-19-related anxieties in first-time mothers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and after 6 months: A descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease responsible for over 1 2 million deaths worldwide as of November 2020 The need for rapid testing is a high priority and alternative testing strategies including x-ray image classification are a promising area of research However, at present, public datasets for COVID-19 x-ray images have low data volumes, making it challenging to develop accurate image classifiers Several recent papers have made use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in order to increase the training data volumes But realistic synthetic COVID-19 x-rays remain challenging to generate We present a novel Mean Teacher + Transfer GAN (MTT-GAN) that generates COVID-19 chest x-ray images of high quality In order to create a more accurate GAN, we employ transfer learning from the Kaggle pneumonia x-ray dataset, a highly relevant data source orders of magnitude larger than public COVID-19 datasets Furthermore, we employ the Mean Teacher algorithm as a constraint to improve stability of training Our qualitative analysis shows that the MTT-GAN generates x-ray images that are greatly superior to a baseline GAN and visually comparable to real x-rays Although board-certified radiologists can distinguish MTT-GAN fakes from real COVID-19 x-rays, quantitative analysis shows that MTT-GAN greatly improves the accuracy of both a binary COVID-19 classifier as well as a multi-class pneumonia classifier as compared to a baseline GAN Our classification accuracy is favorable as compared to recently reported results in the literature for similar binary and multi-class COVID-19 screening tasks ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Generating Realistic COVID-19 x-rays with a Mean Teacher + Transfer Learning GAN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS Establishing epicardial flow with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is necessary but not sufficient to ensure nutritive myocardial reperfusion. We evaluated whether adding myocardial blush grade (MBG) and quantitative reperfusion ventricular arrhythmia \\"bursts\\" (VABs) surrogates provide a more informative biosignature of optimal reperfusion in patients with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow and ST-segment recovery (STR). METHODS AND RESULTS Anterior STEMI patients with final TIMI 3 flow had protocol-blinded analyses of simultaneous MBG, continuous 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) STR, Holter VABs, and day 5-14 SPECT imaging infarct size (IS) assessments. Over 20 million cardiac cycles from >4500 h of continuous ECG monitoring in subjects with STR were obtained. IS and clinical outcomes were examined in patients stratified by MBG and VABs. VABs occurred in 51% (79/154) of subjects. Microcirculation (MBG 2/3) was restored in 75% (115/154) of subjects, of whom 53% (61/115) had VABs. No VABs were observed in subjects without microvascular flow (MBG of 0). Of 115 patients with TIMI 3 flow, STR, and MBG 2/3, those with VABs had significantly larger IS (median: 23.0% vs 6.0%, p=0.001). Multivariable analysis identified reperfusion VABs as a factor significantly associated with larger IS (p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS Despite restoration of normal epicardial flow, open microcirculation, and STR, concomitant VABs are associated with larger myocardial IS, possibly reflecting myocellular injury in reperfusion settings. Combining angiographic and ECG parameters of epicardial, microvascular, and cellular response to STEMI intervention provides a more predictive \\"biosignature\\" of optimal reperfusion than do single surrogate markers.","output":"Implications of ventricular arrhythmia \\"bursts\\" with normal epicardial flow, myocardial blush, and ST-segment recovery in anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction reperfusion: a biosignature of direct myocellular injury \\"downstream of downstream\\"."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report a 54-year-old man who underwent double-sleeve left upper lobectomy for lung cancer and his postoperative course was complicated with COVID-19 pneumonia.

intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in adults with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to 73 ICUs from Spain, Andorra and Ireland between February 2020 and March 2021. The first wave corresponded with the period from February 2020 to June 2020, whereas the second/third waves occurred from July 2020 to March 2021. The primary outcome was ICU mortality between study periods. Mortality predictors and differences in mortality between COVID-19 waves were identified using logistic regression. FINDINGS: As of March 2021, the participating ICUs had included 3795 COVID-19 pneumonia patients, 2479 (653%) and 1316 (347%) belonging to the first and second/third waves, respectively. Illness severity scores predicting mortality were lower in the second/third waves compared with the first wave according with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation system (median APACHE II score 12 [IQR 9C16] vs 14 [IQR 10C19]) and the organ failure assessment score (median SOFA 4 [3C6] vs 5 [3C7], p<0001). The need of invasive mechanical ventilation was high (761%) during the whole study period. However, a significant increase in the use of high flow nasal cannula (487% vs 182%, p<0001) was found in the second/third waves compared with the first surge. Significant changes on treatments prescribed were also observed, highlighting the remarkable increase on the use of corticosteroids to up to 95.9% in the second/third waves. A significant reduction on the use of tocilizumab was found during the study (first wave 289% vs second/third waves 62%, p<0001), and a negligible administration of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon during the second/third waves compared with the first wave. Overall ICU mortality was 307% (n = 1166), without significant differences between study periods (first wave 317% vs second/third waves 288%, p = 006). No significant differences were found in ICU mortality between waves according to age subsets except for the subgroup of 61C75 years of age, in whom a reduced unadjusted ICU mortality was observed in the second/third waves (first 387% vs second/third 340%, p = 0048). Non-survivors were older, with higher severity of the disease, had more comorbidities, and developed more complications. After adjusting for confounding factors through a multivariable analysis, no significant association was found between the COVID-19 waves and mortality (OR 081, 95% CI 064C103; p = 009). Ventilator-associated pneumonia rate increased significantly during the second/third waves and it was independently associated with ICU mortality (OR 148, 95% CI 119C185, p<0001). Nevertheless, a significant reduction both in the ICU and hospital length of stay in survivors was observed during the second/third waves.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital between July 2018 and June 2020. Eighty-five children with WS who presented within one year from the onset of epileptic spasms were included. The details of the treatment costs (direct medical and nonmedical) incurred during the first year from the onset of epileptic spasms were noted from a parental interview and case record review. Unit cost was fixed for drugs and specific services. Total cost was estimated by multiplying the unit cost by the number of times a drug or service was availed. The determinants of the financial burden were also explored. RESULTS: The median monthly per-capita income of the enrolled families (n = 85) was INR 3000 (Q1, Q3, 2000, 6000). The median cost of treatment over one year was INR 27035 (Q1, Q3, 17,894, 39,591). Median direct medical and nonmedical expenses amounted to INR 18802 (Q1, Q3, 12,179, 25,580) and INR 6550 (Q1, Q3, 3500, 15,000), respectively. Seven families had catastrophic healthcare expenditure. Parental education and choice of first-line treatment were important determinants driving healthcare expenses. The age at onset of epileptic spasms, etiology, treatment lag, the initial response to treatment, and relapse following initial response did not significantly influence the illness-related expenditure by the families.

AIM: To explore relatives' experiences and needs when a family member was dying during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Interpretative qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed thematically. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 19 relatives whose family member died during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: In the absence of direct physical contact, it was important for families to have a clear understanding of their family member's condition and declining health, stay connected with them in the final weeks/days of life and have the opportunity for a final contact before they died. Health and social care professionals were instrumental to providing these aspects of care, but faced practical challenges in achieving these. Results are presented within three themes: (1) entering into the final weeks and days of life during a pandemic, (2) navigating the final weeks of life during a pandemic and (3) the importance of 'saying goodbye' in a pandemic.

Mechanical thrombectomy success is commonly assessed by the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score, assigned by visual inspection of X-ray digital subtraction angiography data. However, expert-based TICI scoring is highly observer-dependent. This represents a major obstacle for mechanical thrombectomy outcome comparison in, for instance, multicentric clinical studies. Focusing on occlusions of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery, the present study aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) solution to automated and, therefore, objective TICI scoring, to evaluate the agreement of DL- and expert-based scoring, and to compare corresponding numbers to published scoring variability of clinical experts. METHODS The study comprises 2 independent datasets. For DL system training and initial evaluation, an in-house dataset of 491 digital subtraction angiography series and modified TICI scores of 236 patients with M1 occlusions was collected. To test the model generalization capability, an independent external dataset with 95 digital subtraction angiography series was analyzed. Characteristics of the DL system were modeling TICI scoring as ordinal regression, explicit consideration of the temporal image information, integration of physiological knowledge, and modeling of inherent TICI scoring uncertainties. RESULTS For the in-house dataset, the DL system yields Cohen's kappa, overall accuracy, and specific agreement values of 0.61, 71%, and 63% to 84%, respectively, compared with the gold standard: the expert rating. Values slightly drop to 0.52/64%/43% to 87% when the model is, without changes, applied to the external dataset. After model updating, they increase to 0.65/74%/60% to 90%. Literature Cohen's kappa values for expert-based TICI scoring agreement are in the order of 0.6. CONCLUSIONS The agreement of DL- and expert-based modified TICI scores in the range of published interobserver variability of clinical experts highlights the potential of the proposed DL solution to automated TICI scoring.","output":"Deep Learning-Based Automated Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scoring: A Timely Proof-of-Principle Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a serious threat to public health. Previous studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect human ovary, the core organ of the female reproductive system. However, it remains unclear which type of ovarian cells are easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 and whether ovarian infectivity differs from puberty to menopause. In this study, public datasets containing bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq data derived from ovarian tissues were analyzed to demonstrate the mRNA expression and protein distribution of the two key entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2). Furthermore, an immunohistochemical study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human ovaries of different ages was conducted. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis of ovaries of different ages and with varying ovarian reserves was conducted to explore the potential functions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the ovary. The analysis of the public datasets indicated that the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was observed mostly in oocytes and partially in granulosa cells. However, no marked difference was observed in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression between young and old ovaries and ovaries with low and high reserves. Correspondingly, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were detected in the human ovarian cortex and medulla, especially in oocytes of different stages, with no observed variations in their expression level in ovaries of different ages, which was consistent with the results of bioinformatic analyses. Remarkably, DEG analysis showed that a series of viral infection-related pathways were more enriched in ACE2-positive ovarian cells than in ACE2-negative ovarian cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may potentially target specific ovarian cells and affect ovarian function. However, further fundamental and clinical research is still needed to monitor the process of SARS-CoV-2 entry into ovarian cells and the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the ovarian function in recovered females.","output":"Co-expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human ovaries: Identification of cell types and trends with age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most randomized trials are designed and analyzed using frequentist statistical approaches such as null hypothesis testing and P values. Conceptually, P values are cumbersome to understand, as they provide evidence of data incompatibility with a null hypothesis (e.g., no clinical benefit) and not direct evidence of the alternative hypothesis (e.g., clinical benefit). This counterintuitive framework may contribute to the misinterpretation that the absence of evidence is equal to evidence of absence and may cause the discounting of potentially informative data. Bayesian methods provide an alternative, probabilistic interpretation of data. The reanalysis of completed trials using Bayesian methods is becoming increasingly common, particularly for trials with effect estimates that appear clinically significant despite P values above the traditional threshold of 0.05. Statistical inference using Bayesian methods produces a distribution of effect sizes that would be compatible with observed trial data, interpreted in the context of prior assumptions about an intervention (called priors). These priors are chosen by investigators to reflect existing beliefs and past empirical evidence regarding the effect of an intervention. By calculating the likelihood of clinical benefit, a Bayesian reanalysis can augment the interpretation of a trial. However, if priors are not defined a priori, there is a legitimate concern that priors could be constructed in a manner that produces biased results. Therefore, some standardization of priors for Bayesian reanalysis of clinical trials may be desirable for the critical care community. In this Critical Care Perspective, we discuss both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to clinical trial analysis, introduce a framework that researchers can use to select priors for a Bayesian reanalysis, and demonstrate how to apply our proposal by conducting a novel Bayesian trial reanalysis.","output":"Using Bayesian Methods to Augment the Interpretation of Critical Care Trials.

As a result, these patients require regular monitoring of the complete blood counts (CBC) for optimal patient care. To reduce the strain on the patient, there is a need for a point-of-care (POC) hematology device that provides rapid and reliable results both in general and in cytopenic samples and is suitable for outpatient clinics. We evaluated the HemoScreen device for the most used CBC parameter both overall and at the lower range. METHODS The HemoScreen was compared with the Sysmex XN-9000 in 206 routine venous samples and 79 capillary bedside samples focusing on white blood cells (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), red blood cells (RBC), PLT and HGB. RESULTS The HemoScreen was less precise compared to the acceptance criteria set for larger and more advanced hematology instrument with a CV% 3.0-3.7 for WBCs, 3.6-8.4 for ANCs, 1.1-1.5 for RBCs, 2.5-4.4 for PLTs, and 1.7-2.3 for HGB. Correlation coefficient for all five parameters for the entire range was r >.95 and r >.90 at lower range for venous and capillary samples. Bias limits were within the CTCAE acceptance limits. CONCLUSIONS The HemoScreen provides rapid and accurate test results, for evaluation of WBC, PLT, and HGB, as well as at low concentrations for guiding transfusions and postchemotherapy treatment.

The European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) aimed to evaluate surgeons' experiences and perspectives, to identify gaps in knowledge, to record shortcomings in resources and to register research priorities. METHODS: An ad hoc web-based survey of EAES members and affiliates was developed by the EAES Research Committee. The questionnaire consisted of 69 items divided into the following sections: (&#921;) demographics, (II) institutional burdens and management strategies, and (III) analysis of resource, knowledge, and evidence gaps. Descriptive statistics were summarized as frequencies, medians, ranges,, and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. RESULTS: The survey took place between March 25th and April 16th with a total of 550 surgeons from 79 countries. Eighty-one percent had to postpone elective cases or suspend their practice and 35% assumed roles not related to their primary expertise. One-fourth of respondents reported having encountered abdominal pathologies in COVID-19-positive patients, most frequently acute appendicitis (47% of respondents). The effect of protective measures in surgical or endoscopic procedures on infected patients, the effect of endoscopic surgery on infected patients, and the infectivity of positive patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery were prioritized as knowledge gaps and research priorities.

Those with existing comorbidities and minority ethnic groups have been found to be at increased risk of mortality. We wished to determine if there were any differences in intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 30-day hospital mortality in a city with high levels of deprivation and a large community of people of South Asian heritage. Methods: Detailed information on 622 COVID-19-positive inpatients in Bradford and Calderdale between February-August 2020 were extracted from Electronic Health Records. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between ethnicity with admission to ICU and 30-day mortality, respectively accounting for the effect of demographic and clinical confounders. Results: The sample consisted of 408 (70%) White, 142 (24%) South Asian and 32 (6%) other minority ethnic patients. Ethnic minority patients were younger, more likely to live in deprived areas, and be overweight/obese, have type 2 diabetes, hypertension and asthma compared to white patients, but were less likely to have cancer (South Asian patients only) and COPD. Male and obese patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU, and patients of South Asian ethnicity, older age, and those with cancer were less likely. Being male, older age, deprivation, obesity, and cancer were associated with 30-day mortality. The risk of death in South Asian patients was the same as in white patients HR 1.03 (0.58, 1.82). Conclusions: Despite South Asian patients being less likely to be admitted to ICU and having a higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity, there was no difference in the risk of death compared to white patients.

Healthcare personnel details were collected, including profession, years of professional experience and adverse reactions while wearing L3PPE. Survey results were divided by profession and years of professional experience; differences in adverse reactions were compared. RESULTS: Among the 129 healthcare professionals surveyed, 21 (16.28%) were doctors and 108 (83.72%) were nurses. A total of 122 (94.57%) healthcare professionals experienced discomfort while wearing L3PPE to treat patients with COVID-19. The main reasons for adverse reactions and discomfort include varying degrees of adverse skin reactions, respiratory difficulties, heat stress, dizziness and nausea.

METHODS: This was a time series analysis of visits to 7 EDs in greater Chicago, Illinois from October 20, 2019 to July 25, 2020. We compared the number of ED visits for opioid-related diagnoses in the time period preceding the World Health Organization pandemic declaration (prepandemic period, October 20, 2019CJuly 3, 2020) to the time period following the World Health Organization declaration (pandemic period, March 8, 2020 to July 25, 2020) using a single-group interrupted time series analysis with Newey-West standard errors. We also present data on alcohol-related ED visits for comparison. RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 177,405 visits across the 7 EDs during the study period. The mean number of weekly ED visits in the prepandemic and pandemic periods was 4841 and 4029 weekly visits, respectively. In the interrupted time series analysis, there was no significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on opioid-related ED visits (?0.44 visits per 1000 ED visits, 95% CI ?2.47 to 1.58, P = 0.66), however, there was a significant immediate effect of the pandemic start on alcohol-related ED visits (?4.1, 95% CI: ?8.25 to ?0.01, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite reductions in overall ED visit volumes and alcohol-related visits during COVID-19, the number of opioid-related visits was not significantly reduced during the early pandemic.

Public health is the main focus of government attention. One of the efforts that have been made is to break the chain of covid transmission by limiting activities outside the home and self-quarantine. After carrying out activities only at home social and economic problems emerge requiring people to return to carrying out activities to meet their daily needs. The new life order or the so-called new normal is an alternative for the government to solve these complex problems. The public is expected to implement health protocols in the new normal era as a form of efforts to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. To achieve this goal the participation of health workers is highly expected. The role of education is the main thing that must be done considering that many people dont know dont understand about the new normal and what health protocols must be done in the new normal era. Kediri City is one of the areas that is of concern to the East Java Provincial Government because even though it is in the yellow zone it has a high risk of increasing its status because it is a reference city in the trade economy sector in the Kediri residency area. The updated data obtained from the Kediri City Office on 4 August 2020 obtained an additional 110 cases. One factor in the increase in cases is due to the tendency of peoples attitudes and behavior to ignore health protocols. Therefore, education is an urgent thing that must be done so that the public knows and understands how to live a new life while still paying attention to health protocols as a form of efforts to prevent COVID-19 transmission. The abdimas team in collaboration with Puskesmas Campurejo carries out community service to provide Health Protocol Education in the New Normal era in efforts to support the central government and local government programs of Kediri City. The key to the success of efforts to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 is if the Government Health Workers and all levels of society work together to comply with health protocols properly.

We studied the GQ-forming sequence (named HepB) found in the genome of the hepatitis B virus. Fluorescence-, infrared- and CD-spectroscopy were used. HepB shows a hybrid form in presence of K(+), but Na(+), Li(+), and Rb(+) induce parallel structure. Higher concentrations of metal ions increase the unfolding temperature, which was explained by a short thermodynamic calculation. Temperature stability of the GQ structure was determined for all these ions. Na(+) has stronger stabilizing effect on HepB than K(+), which is highly unusual. The transition temperatures were 56.6, 53.8, 58.5 and 54.4 C for Na(+), K(+), Li(+), and Rb(+) respectively. Binding constants for Na(+) and K(+) were 10.2 mM and 7.1 mM respectively. Study of three ligands designed in cancer research for GQ targeting (TMPyP4, BRACO19 and PhenDC3) showed unequivocally their binding to HepB.

Ordinal regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The rates of depression observed (moderate or severe depression: 22.5%) and anxiety (moderate or severe anxiety: 18.4%) were higher than usual but lower than what has been documented in other studies on the effects of lockdown. Women appeared to be more vulnerable than men (Anxiety: AOR=1.647, CI 95%=1.647-2.530; Depression: AOR=1.622, CI 95%=1.274-2.072).

Re-purposing the available protease inhibitor drugs for immediate use in treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infections could improve the currently available clinical management. The current study, aims to predict theoretical structure for protease of COVID-19 and to explore further whether this protein can serve as a target for protease inhibitor drugs such as remdesivir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir and -ketoamide. While the 3D structure of protease was predicted using SWISS MODEL server, molecular interaction studies between protein and ligands were performed using AutoDock software. The predicted protease model was reasonably good based on reports generated by different validation servers. The study further revealed that all the protease inhibitor drugs got docked with negative dock energy onto the target protein. Molecular interaction studies showed that protease structure had multiple active site residues for remdesivir, while for remaining ligands the structure had only one active site residue each. From the output of multiple sequence alignment, it is evident that ligand binding sites were conserved. The current in silico study thus, provides structural insights about the protease of COVID-19 and also its molecular interactions with some of the known protease inhibitors.

The main port of entry for the virus is the upper respiratory tract, and the diagnosis is usually by PCR of the viral RNA with nasal and pharyngeal swab test. Human defensin 5 (HDEF5) is a protein encoded by the DEFA gene, secreted by Paneth cells in the small intestine and by granules of neutrophils. It has an affinity of 39.3 nM to ACE2, much higher than that of the corona S1. HDEF5 may also attach to glycosylated Corona S1 protein, make its efficiency even better. The issues to be investigated are the affinity of HDEF5 to S1 protein, the ability of recombinant HDEF5 function in attaching both ACE2 and S1, and the feasibility to perform aerosol spray of this protein. In addition, safety and efficiency should be studied in phases I, II and II clinical protocols. Thus, an aerosol spray of HDEF5 given through the nose and throat, once to several times a day, may be a very efficient approach to prevent infection with SARA-CoV-2 as well as influenza A.","output":"Defensin 5 for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 invasion and Covid-19 Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of vaccination programs against COVID-19 in different countries, several populations such as patients with specific immunological conditions have been considered as the priorities for immunization. In this regard, patients with autoimmune diseases or those receiving immunosuppressive agents and anti-cancer therapies, need special attention. However, no confirmed data is presently available regarding COVID-19 vaccines in these populations due to exclusion from the conducted clinical trials. Given the probable suppression or over-activation of the immune system in such patients, reaching a consensus for their vaccination is critical, besides gathering data and conducting trials, which could probably clarify this matter in the future. In this review, besides a brief on the available COVID-19 vaccines, considerations and available knowledge about administering similar vaccines in patients with cancer, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, solid organ transplantation, multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatologic and dermatologic autoimmune disorders are summarized to help in decision making. As discussed, live-attenuated viruses, which should be avoided in these groups, are not employed in the present COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, the main concern regarding efficacy could be met using a potent COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, the vaccination timing for maximum efficacy could be decided according to the patient's condition, indicated medications, and the guides provided here. Post-vaccination monitoring is also advised to ensure an adequate immune response.

Residential food waste disposal has increased by as much as 30% since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and landfills are reaching capacity more quickly as up to 40% of food is thrown into the trash. A residential food disposal collection campaign to recycle food waste and carbon emissions could be implemented to grow economically sustainable algae on landfills. NASA Surface Attached BioReactor (SABR) technology optimizes growth performance of algae, reduces the capital expenditure by 69% compared to clear polyvinyl chloride (PVC) photobioreactors, and the landfill infrastructure reduces the operational costs for growing algae by 42%. The novel Eat Prosperity Campaign food waste collection and landfill biodiesel model may outcompete standard drilling methods, yielding revenue greater than $100 million, diverting more than 200,000 t of municipal solid waste, and recycling 13,000 t2of methane from food waste annually, per county landfill. The Eat Prosperity Campaign model for food waste collection provides a significant abatement of global greenhouse gas emissions potential within a communal behavioral change. By allowing residents within communities the opportunity to recycle at the source of disposal and actively participate, business-as-usual estimations of global greenhouse gas emissions could be offset by as much as 47 GtCO2in 20 years compared to current 2030 projected estimates. ?

Cancer has been reported as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes of and death from COVID-19. We extracted data from the World Health Organizations progress reports and from the Italian Council of Medicine. In addition, we retrieved clinical data on cancer patients with confirmed COVID-19 in our Institution. As of April 2nd, 2020, 110 574 COVID-19 cases and 13 157 deaths have been described in Italy, representing a global share of 5.1% and 28.9% for incidence and mortality, respectively. In Italy, we report the analysis of the Italian Medical Council on 909 patients who died from COVID-19, of whom 16.5% were cancer patients. The population was enriched with subjects with multiple co-morbid non-communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no co-morbid conditions. At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard of care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings. The median age was 68 years (range: 42C79 years), and patients carried a median of one co-morbid condition (0C2); two out of nine patients presented with severe COVID-19 presentation, and were receiving inpatient care. None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of cancer patients to treatments, prioritizing the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value, and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients. Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including in clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the Global Response Agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as One Community working for One Healths.","output":"The experience on COVID-19 and cancer from an oncology hub institution in Milan, Lombardy Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a nationwide, registry-based study to investigate the importance of 34 potential risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis, hospitalization (with or without intensive care unit [ICU] admission), and subsequent all-cause mortality.

Older age was the strongest risk factor for hospitalization, although the odds of ICU hospitalization decreased after 60C69 years and, after controlling for other risk factors, the odds of non-ICU hospitalization showed no trend after 40C49 years. Residence in a long-term care facility was associated with non-ICU hospitalization. Male sex and the presence of at least one investigated comorbidity or prescription medication were associated with both ICU and non-ICU hospitalization. Three comorbidities associated with both ICU and non-ICU hospitalization were asthma, hypertension, and Down syndrome. History of cancer was not associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, but cancer in the past year was associated with non-ICU hospitalization, after controlling for other risk factors. Cardiovascular disease was weakly associated with non-ICU hospitalization for COVID-19, but not with ICU hospitalization, after adjustment for other risk factors. Excess mortality was observed in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 cases. These results confirm that severe COVID-19 is related to age, sex, and comorbidity in general.

The quantitative assessment was based on wearable magneto-inertial measurement units (MIMUs). Eight male semi-professional football players participated in the study, which was characterized by a football-specific fatiguing protocol in an uncontrolled environment and a test on vertical jump (i.e., Bosco test). Six kinematic parameters were selected as suitable indicators for ballistic skill assessment (i.e., maximum height, mean exerted power, relative strength index, leg stiffness, contact time and flight time). The temporal analysis of their variations allowed to monitor the athletes' recovery. A significant effect of fatigue on measured variables was confirmed during the four weeks for three parameters in the Bosco test. Friedman's test confirmed significant differences across the four weeks for the aforementioned parameters (p < 0.05). From the Cliff's delta effect size, it can be confirmed that after four weeks the fatigue protocol effects were no longer detectable by our instrumental parameters, suggesting a full recovery of athletes' ballistic ability after the COVID-19 forced rest period. Indeed, the mean estimated effect size were 0.73 in the first week, 0.98 in the second one, 0.58 in third and 0.17 in the last one.

Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed Android malware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains 4,322 COVID-19 themed apk samples (2,500 unique apps) and 611 potential malware samples (370 unique malicious apps) by the time of mid-November, 2020. We then present an analysis of them from multiple perspectives including trends and statistics, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious actors behind them. We observe that the COVID-19 themed apps as well as malicious ones began to flourish almost as soon as the pandemic broke out worldwide. Most malicious apps are camouflaged as benign apps using the same app identifiers (e.g., app name, package name and app icon). Their main purposes are either stealing users' private information or making profit by using tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, only a quarter of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who have been active for a long time, while 75% of them are newcomers in this pandemic. The malicious developers are mainly located in US, mostly targeting countries including English-speaking countries, China, Arabic countries and Europe.

These cases are rare and novel, and very little is known. In our systematic review, we analyzed every published case of AIH and reviewed their characteristic findings, treatment, and outcomes. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from December 1, 2019, to November 1, 2021. Two researchers independently extracted information from the articles about vaccine type, patient history, laboratory values, histology results, treatment regimens, and disease course. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients developed AIH-like syndromes after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Jaundice was the most frequently reported symptom (81%), and 19% of patients were initially asymptomatic and presented with elevated liver enzymes found during routine bloodwork. Mean alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and total bilirubin were 1231 U/L, 921 U/L, and 14 mg/dL, respectively. Anti-nuclear antibody was positive in 56%, and anti-smooth muscle antibody in 28% of patients. Steroids were used in 75% of patients. Improvement or complete resolution was seen in 97% of patients. One patient died despite aggressive steroid treatment. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine-induced AIH is an uncommon association with just 32 documented cases in the literature. Clinicians should be vigilant for AIH in patients who present with liver injury following vaccination. These new findings should under not deter individuals from getting vaccinated, as the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.

However, the mechanism for matrikine regulation in acute inflammation has not been well established. Here, we show that these peptides are actively transported from the lung by the oligopeptide transporter, PEPT2. Following intratracheal instillation of Ac-PGP in a mouse model, there was a rapid decline in concentration of the labeled peptide in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) over time and redistribution to extrapulmonary sites. In vitro knockdown of the PEPT2 transporter in airway epithelia or use of a competitive inhibitor of PEPT2, cefadroxil, significantly reduced uptake of Ac-PGP. Animals that received intratracheal Ac-PGP plus cefadroxil had higher levels of Ac-PGP in BAL and lung tissue. Utilizing an acute LPS-induced lung injury model, we demonstrate that PEPT2 blockade enhanced pulmonary Ac-PGP levels and lung inflammation. We further validated this effect using clinical samples from patients with acute lung injury in coculture with airway epithelia. This is the first study to our knowledge to determine the in vitro and in vivo significance of active matrikine transport as a mechanism of modulating acute inflammation and to demonstrate that it may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","output":"A mechanism for matrikine regulation in acute inflammatory lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e. the virus causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is dramatically increasing worldwide to the size of a pandemic. At the time of writing Italy is ranking first among countries both in terms of number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and in terms of number of deaths. Such a wide spread of COVID-19 has led to concern among workers who are facing the risk of becoming infected during the execution of their duties. We believe it is useful to remark on the need for professional expertise in the field of Occupational Hygiene in this emergency context, in which the indications provided by national and international bodies, the available scientific literature and the legal provisions are constantly and rapidly evolving. It is of fundamental importance that there is an effective analysis of expert inputs, to provide essential guidance to Health, Safety and Environmental managers and other prevention managers in workplaces. In this regard, not only a constant update of the regulatory framework is needed, but also a development and circulation of operational guidance to all the stakeholders to translate general indications into clear operating procedures and implementation tools to be adopted in the workplaces. We believe that the scientific associations in the field of Occupational Hygiene play a crucial role in guiding and assisting prevention professionals. There is considerable expertise in the occupational hygiene and exposure science communities that can help employers and workers to contain and delay the spread of COVID-19. For this reason, the Italian Association of Industrial Hygienists (AIDII-Associazione Italiana degli Igienisti Industriali) published documents containing operational guidelines to provide correct and constantly updated information for: (i) workers employed in essential activities (with low and medium risk of contagion), (ii) health workers and other workers at high or very high risk of contagion, and (iii) for the correct use and handling of personal protective equipment for workers and for the population in general. It is worth pointing out that the documents produced are not intended to replace those produced by authoritative bodies, but to comply with and complete them by reporting an effective summary and further indications about the measures that should be taken in practice under the light of the Italian legislation. At present, the challenge is to produce scientifically sound knowledge, appropriate tools, and effective methodologies, by coordinating the initiatives of different scientific associations, with the final aim to effectively transfer them to employers and workers.","output":"COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy: Protecting Worker Health and the Response of the Italian Industrial Hygienists Association"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy lacks a gender perspective, and it is unclear whether gender intersects with socioeconomic status to co-produce inequalities in people's intent to take vaccines.

The results suggest that American women had a higher vaccine hesitancy rate than men. Gender interacts with socioeconomic status to shape people's vaccine hesitancy in a complex way. Specifically, women living in poverty or currently working were more vaccine-hesitant, while poverty and employment status did not affect men's vaccine hesitancy. However, not having a college education contributed to both women's and men's COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, women were more worried about the safety of the vaccine, but men's hesitancy tended to be driven by lower perceptions of COVID-19 dangers and belief in conspiratorial claims.","output":"Gender, socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the US: An intersectionality approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The presence of conditions, such as cardiovascular or chronic lung diseases, was reported to be associated with more severe cases of COVID-19. It is, however, so far unclear how patients with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) perceive their individual COVID-19 risk. Moreover, their worries and preventive behaviors and their associations with risk perception are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A postal survey was conducted in April 2020, including participants with previous PE from the German \\"Lungenembolie Augsburg\\" (LEA) cohort study. The questionnaire contained items on COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception (infection likelihood, susceptibility, dangerousness), information sources and satisfaction with information, individual assignment to a high risk group due to pre-existing conditions, worries, infection likelihood, and implementation of preventive behaviors. RESULTS: From the 185 respondents, 71.7% assigned themselves to a high risk group in terms of developing a severe case of COVID-19. The likelihood of being infected was rated as verylow/low by 82.3% and the susceptability by 37.8%. A considerable percentage of patients expected a very high/high infection risk in a hospital (48.3%) or at a doctor's practice (37.9%). Major sources of information were the patients' general practitioners (48.9%) and the internet (31.5%). Assignment to a high risk group (? = 1.04) and uncertainty in terms of assignment (? = 1.26) were significantly (p = 0.01) associated with a higher level of health-related worries.

The aim of the present study was to identify the clinical conditions and echocardiographic parameters associated with in-hospital mortality in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a multicentre retrospective observational study including seven Italian centres. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 1 March to 22 April 2020, were included into the study population. The association between baseline variables and the risk of in-hospital mortality was assessed through multivariable logistic regression and competing risk analyses. Out of 1401 patients admitted at the participating centres with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, 226 (16.1%) underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and were included in the present analysis. The mean age was 68.9  13.9 years and male sex was reported in 141 patients (62.4%). Admission in intensive care unit was required for 72 patients (31.9%); in-hospital death occurred in 68 patients (30.1%). At multivariable analysis, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, P < 0.001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE, P < 0.001), and ARDS (P < 0.001) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. At competing risk analysis, we found a significantly higher risk of mortality in patients with ARDS vs. those without ARDS (HR: 7.66; CI: 3.95C14.8), in patients with TAPSE  17 mm vs. those with TAPSE > 17 mm (HR: 5.08; CI: 3.15C8.19), and in patients with LVEF  50% vs. those with LVEF > 50% (HR: 4.06; CI: 2.50C6.59) (Figure). CONCLUSIONS: TTE might be a useful tool in risk stratification of patients with COVID-19.

This study aimed to evaluate the usability of the telerehabilitation service program at UP-PGH when it was expanded during the pandemic and to associate telerehabilitation usability ratings with the participant groups, demographic characteristics, and prior telemedicine knowledge and experience. Methods. This cross-sectional study involved the doctors, physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, patients, and patients carers, who participated in at least one telerehabilitation session and consented to respond to a digital survey thereafter. Total enumeration sampling of all telerehabilitation participants was employed. The study outcome was the usability of the expanded telerehabilitation program based on the System Usability Scale (SUS) benchmarked at 68. Descriptive and inferential statistics were done at a 95% confidence interval. The participants responses to open-ended questions regarding telerehabilitation experience and recommendations were also presented. Results. The participants consisted of 19 doctors, 11 therapists, 37 patients, and 74 caregivers. The majority of the participants were female and lived in urban areas. The primary online telerehabilitation platforms used were Viber? and Zoom?. The mean of overall SUS scores was below average for health providers [doctors (mean = 61.71), therapists (mean = 67.73)];and above average for end-users [patients (mean 74.56), and carers (mean = 71.89)]. There was a significant difference in the overall SUS scores between doctors (mean: 61.7) and patients (mean: 74.6), p<0.05. In terms of videoconferencing platform, participants reported significantly higher system usability for those who used either Zoom? (mean: 75.0) or Viber? (mean: 69.3), as compared to Google Meet? (mean: 53.1), p<0.05. There was no significant difference in the overall SUS scores across sexes, places of residence, primary telerehabilitation techniques used, prior telemedicine knowledge, and experience. The majority viewed telerehabilitation as a valuable method to provide service during the pandemic, but they were mostly concerned with technical problems, particularly an unstable Internet connection. Conclusion. The expanded telerehabilitation service program of the PGH was perceived as useful by patients and caregivers but not by the health providers. While the program succeeded in providing continued outpatient rehabilitation services during the pandemic, the challenges experienced by its telehealth providers must be investigated and addressed. ? 2022 University of the Philippines Manila.

OBJECTIVES To assess the association between RAAS inhibitor use and two outcomes: infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Model 1) and severe COVID-19 among those infected (Model 2). METHODS We accessed used electronic health records of individuals from Israel who were receiving anti-hypertensive medications for this retrospective study. For Model 1 we used a case-control design. For Model 2 we used a cohort design. In both models, inverse probability weighting adjusted for identified confounders as part of doubly robust outcome regression. RESULTS We tested 38,554 individuals for SARS-CoV-2 who had hypertension and were being treated with medication; 691 had a positive test result. Among those with a positive test, 119 developed severe illness. There was no association between RAAS inhibitor use and a positive test. Use of RAAS inhibitors was associated with a decreased risk for severe COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.47, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.29-0.77) compared with users of non-RAAS anti-hypertensive medication. The association remained significant when use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0.46, 95%CI 0.27-0.77) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (adjusted OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.16-0.95) were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS Among individuals with hypertension using RAAS inhibitors, we found a lower risk of severe disease compared to those using non-RAAS anti-hypertensive medications. This finding suggests that RAAS inhibitors may have a protective effect on COVID-19 severity among individuals with medically treated hypertension.","output":"Association of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Inhibitors with COVID-19 Infection and Disease Severity among Individuals with Hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic accelerates, the supply of personal protective equipment remains under strain. To combat shortages, re-use of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended. Prior decontamination is paramount to the re-use of these typically single-use only items and, without compromising their integrity, must guarantee inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other contaminating pathogens. AIM: We provide information on the effect of time-dependent passive decontamination (infectivity loss over time during room temperature storage in a breathable bag) and evaluate inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a non-enveloped model virus as well as mask and respirator integrity following active multiple-cycle vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and dry heat (DH) decontamination. METHODS: Masks and respirators, inoculated with infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus or murine norovirus, were submitted to passive decontamination or single or multiple active decontamination cycles; viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured via TCID50 assay. In parallel, filtration efficiency tests and breathability tests were performed according to EN standard 14683 and NIOSH regulations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus and murine norovirus remained detectable on masks and respirators up to five and seven days of passive decontamination. Single and multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH were shown to not adversely affect bacterial filtration efficiency of masks. Single- and multiple UVGI did not adversely affect respirator filtration efficiency, while VHP and DH induced a decrease in filtration efficiency after one or three decontamination cycles. Multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH slightly decreased airflow resistance of masks but did not adversely affect respirator breathability. VHP and UVGI efficiently inactivated both viruses after five, DH after three, decontamination cycles, permitting demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude. This multi-disciplinal approach provides important information on how often a given PPE item may be safely reused.","output":"\\"Don, doff, discard\\" to \\"don, doff, decontaminate\\"-FFR and mask integrity and inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a norovirus following multiple vaporised hydrogen peroxide-, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation-, and dry heat decontaminations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective : To investigate the effect of interview format changes (in-person to virtual, one-to-one to multiple-to-one) necessitated by the COVID-19 travel restrictions on candidate ranking variabilities.

CVID patients frequently suffer from recurrent infections and inflammatory conditions. Currently, immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) is the first-line treatment to prevent infections and aminorate immune alterations in CVID patients. Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg), a preparation of highly purified poly-specific IgG, is used for treatment of immunodeficiencies as well as for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, as IVIg exerts immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory actions on innate and adaptive immune cells. To determine the mechanism of action of IVIg in CVID in vivo, we determined the effect of IVIg infusion on the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CVID patients, and found that peripheral blood monocytes are primary targets of IVIg in vivo, and that IVIg triggers the acquisition of an anti-inflammatory gene profile in human monocytes. Moreover, IVIg altered the relative proportions of peripheral blood monocyte subsets and enhanced the proportion of CD14(+) cells with a transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional profile that resembles that of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Therefore, our results indicate that CD14 + MDSC-like cells might contribute to the immunoregulatory effects of IVIg in CVID and other inflammatory disorders.

Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. Inhalation of nitric oxide is used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Herein, we evaluated the phenyl furoxan, a well-known exogenous NO donor to identify the possible potent inhibitors through in silico studies such as molecular docking as per target analysis for candidates bound to substrate binding pocket of SARS-COV-2 Mpro. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of most stable docked complexes (Mpro-22 and Mpro-26) helped to confirm the notable conformational stability of these docked complexes under dynamic state.

Various combination antivirals have been tried. Methods A single-center, open-label, parallel-arm, stratified randomized controlled trial evaluated the therapeutic potential of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir in combination with ribavirin in COVID-19. Enrolled patients in severe category were randomized into three groups: A: standard treatment, B: hydroxychloroquine+ribavirin+standard treatment, or C: lopinavir+ritonavir+ribavirin+standard treatment; while non-severe category into two groups: A: standard treatment or B: hydroxychloroquine+ribavirin. Combination antivirals was given for 10 days and followed for 28 days. The primary endpoints were safety, symptomatic and laboratory recovery of organ dysfunctions, and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative report. Results Total 111 patients randomized: 24, 23, and 24 in severe category A, B, and C respectively, and 20 in each non-severe group. Two patients receiving ribavirin experienced drug induced liver injury and another developed QT prolongation after hydroxychloroquine. In the severe category, 47.6%, 55%, and 30.09% in A, B, and C groups respectively showed symptomatic recovery compared to 93.3% and 86.7% in A and B groups respectively in the non-severe category at 72hrs (P>0.05).

There is growing interest in utilising digital technologies to facilitate aspects of focus group research. To date, no study in the pharmacy profession has comprehensively described and evaluated a fully virtual process to focus group research, from recruitment to reimbursement. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to describe an entirely online approach to: recruiting for and facilitating virtual focus group discussions, and reimbursement of participants within the pharmacy profession. Specifically, our objectives were to identify 1) the dropout rate, 2) the geographic diversity of focus group participants, and 3) the occurrence of technological issues. METHOD: Traditional face-to-face focus group recruitment and facilitation methods were adapted, pre-tested, and conducted using online platforms for advertising, participant expressions of interest, participant consent, focus group facilitation, and participant reimbursement. Populations of interest included community pharmacists, specialty practice pharmacists, hospital pharmacists, and pharmacy assistants and technicians across Australia. RESULTS: Of the 153 potential participants who either completed an expression of interest to participate (135/153) or agreed to participate after direct contact (18/153), 59 confirmed that they would attend the focus group discussion (39%); 49 of the 59 (dropout rate: 17%) participated in one of eight focus groups. Collectively, there was representation from all States and Territories in Australia, as well as representation in each of the populations of interest. Three of 49 participants (6%) experienced minor technological issues during the process; no participant encountered major technological issues that precluded successful participation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that an entirely online approach to focus group methodology is possible, has the potential to recruit demographically and geographically-diverse participants with low dropout rates, and can be successfully conducted with minimal technological issues.

However, AM is not only about new production equipment and processes. Given the decreasing degree of vertical integration in many companies, suppliers add significant value to the finished product. AM might lead to the redesign of production networks, including a scenario in which the buyer uses AM to produce parts with data provided by suppliers. Overall, AM could have a major impact on the ways in which buyers and suppliers collaborate in the future. Nevertheless, research on AM in the field of industrial procurement remains scarce. This is surprising, given that AM is not only changing traditional procurement categories and creating new ones (comprising printers, powder raw materials, data and the associated engineering services) but AMs widely discussed potential for decentralisation might also restructure the logistical aspects (transport, stocks) of supply chains. In addition, AM may resurrect the old procurement question of make or buy. Current research focuses on the logistical aspects of AM and concerns such issues of decentralisation (such as the diminishing need for transportation and the design of transport networks). In contrast, this research addresses the question of whether AM demands new answers to strategic sourcing questions. For this purpose, academic journal literature concerning procurement and AM search strings is reviewed. Selected articles are analysed using a fine-grained analytical framework of procurement strategies. The findings show that existing research lacks theoretical approaches and a systematic view of the topic.

Although COVID-19 vaccines are showing promising results, they are not 100% effective and resistant mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains are on the rise. To successfully fight against SARS-CoV-2 and prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks, it is essential to understand SARS-CoV-2 protein functions, their host interactions, and how these processes convey pathogenicity at host tissue, organ and systemic levels. In vitro models are valuable but lack the physiological context of a whole organism. Current animal models for SARS-CoV-2 research are exclusively mammals, with the intrinsic limitations of long reproduction times, few progeny, ethical concerns and high maintenance costs. These limitations make them unsuitable for rapid functional investigations of virus proteins as well as genetic and pharmacological screens.

A second aim was to evaluate the influence of different factors such as fluid and blood administration on brain tissue oxygenation. METHODS This was a prospective pilot study. Mechanically ventilated trauma patients admitted to the trauma unit had cerebral-somatic oxygen saturation monitoring. Oximeter readings (rSO2) were prospectively collected and compared with concurrent values for peripheral pulse oximetry (SO2). Data were recorded every 15 min and during interventions such as administration of a fluid bolus and blood administration. All interventions were based on accepted clinical parameters. RESULTS Thirty-three patients were enrolled. A total of 210 simultaneous measurements of rSO2 and pulse oximetry values were performed. There was correlation between these two parameters in only one third of patients. Twenty-seven events of possible brain ischemia, defined as rSO2 values less than 50 or a decrease of more than 20% from the baseline, were observed. In 68 (77.2%) of these measurements there was no decrease of peripheral SO2. Significant increases in rSO2 were observed only during administration of fluid boluses.

This article reviews the research progress of key signal molecules and transcription factors of TMJ in embryonic development on the basis of modern molecular biology technology in order to find more core regulatory molecules and understand their regulation mechanism on TMJ development.","output":"[Research progress in signal molecules and transcription factors related to the development of temporomandibular joint in embryonic stage]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The Harmonic Scalpel and Ligasure (Covidien) devices are commonly used in head and neck surgery. Parotidectomy is a complex and intricate surgery that requires careful dissection of the facial nerve. This study aimed to compare surgical outcomes in parotidectomy using these haemostatic devices with traditional scalpel and cautery. METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was performed with subsequent meta-analysis of seven studies that compared the use of haemostatic devices to traditional scalpel and cautery in parotidectomy. Outcome measures included: temporary facial paresis, operating time, intra-operative blood loss, post-operative drain output and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies representing 675 patients were identified: 372 patients were treated with haemostatic devices, and 303 patients were treated with scalpel and cautery. Statistically significant outcomes favouring the use of haemostatic devices included operating time, intra-operative blood loss and post-operative drain output. Outcome measures that did not favour either treatment included facial nerve paresis and length of hospital stay.

Viral outbreaks are characterized by socio-behaviorally-oriented public health efforts aimed at reducing exposure and prevention of morbidity/mortality once infected. These efforts involve different points-of-view, generally, than do those aimed to understand the virus' natural history. Rampant spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cities clearly signals that urban areas contain conditions favorable for rapid transmission of the virus. MAIN TEXT: The Critical Medical Ecology model is a multidimensional, multilevel way of viewing pandemics comprehensively, rooted simultaneously in microbiology and in anthropology, with shared priority for evolution, context, stressors, homeostasis, adaptation, and power relationships. Viewing COVID-19 with a Critical Medical Ecological lens suggests three important interpretations: 1) COVID-19 is equally - if not more - a socially-driven disease as much as a biomedical disease, 2) the present interventions available for primary prevention of transmission are social and behavioral interventions, and 3) wide variation in COVID-19 hospitalization/death rates is not expected to significantly be attributable to a more virulent and rapidly-evolving virus, but rather to differences in social and behavioral factors - and power dynamics - rather than (solely) biological and clinical factors. Cities especially are challenged due to logistics and volume of patients, and lack of access to sustaining products and services for many residents living in isolation. CONCLUSIONS: In the end, SARS-CoV-2 is acting upon dynamic social human beings, entangled within structures and relationships that include but extend far beyond their cells, and in fact beyond their own individual behavior. As a comprehensive way of thinking, the Critical Medical Ecology model helps identify these elements and dynamics in the context of ecological processes that create, shape, and sustain people in their multidimensional, intersecting environments.","output":"Critical medical ecology and SARS-COV-2 in the urban environment: a pragmatic, dynamic approach to explaining and planning for research and practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Contact tracing is intended to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is difficult to conduct among people who live in congregate settings, including people experiencing homelessness (PEH). This analysis compares person-based contact tracing among two populations in Salt Lake County, Utah, from March-May 2020. METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed positive cases among PEH (n = 169) and documented in Utah's surveillance system were included in this analysis. The general population comparison group (n = 163) were systematically selected from all laboratory-confirmed cases identified during the same period. RESULTS: Ninety-three PEH cases (55%) were interviewed compared to 163 (100%) cases among the general population (P < .0001). PEH were more likely to be lost to follow-up at end of isolation (14.2%) versus the general population (0%; P-value < .0001) and provided fewer contacts per case (0.3) than the general population (4.7) (P-value < .0001). Contacts of PEH were more often unreachable (13.0% vs. 7.1%; P-value < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that contact tracing among PEH should include a location-based approach, along with a person-based approach when resources allow, due to challenges in identifying, locating, and reaching cases among PEH and their contacts through person-based contact tracing efforts alone.","output":"Assessment of contact tracing for COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness, Salt Lake County Health Department, March-May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the century, the world has witnessed a number of pandemicssuch as plague, Spanish flu, smallpox, and tuberculosis. Such pandemics have not only resulted in a great loss to human lives but have also affected the economy of many countries. COVID-19, declared as global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the latest in this series which has hit the world since the last quarter of 2019. Although a number of scales exist to assess fear and distress of individuals related to COVID-19, it is well articulated in the extant literature that sometimes the proposed scales are context specific and lack applicability in multi-cultural environment as also the factors structure of the scale are fit from the context of audience from certain geographical regions. Thus, a need was felt to evaluate the FCV-19S and propose and statistically validate a new COVID-19-based scale called Phobic COVID-19 Disorder scale (Phobic-19 scale). A structured e-questionnaire in English was used to collect the data from the respondents. A 12-item, three-dimensional (fear, anxiety, and distress) scale was developed to capture the emotions of general populations towards COVID-19. The study analyzes the dimensionality and item structure of the scale through exploratory factor analysis and further validated with the help of confirmatory factor analysis. The results show that the Phobic-19 scale has a strong internal consistency along with better psychometric characteristics. Mass replication and a large number of empirical research using the Phobic-19 scale would instill confidence amongst scholars and practitioners in the results.

CO-CPR appears to be most effective for cardiac causes, but there is a lack of evidence for asphyxial causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Thus, the aim of our study was to compare CO-CPR versus S-CPR in adult OHCA from medical etiologies and assess neurologic outcome in asphyxial and non-asphyxial causes. Methods: Using the French National OHCA Registry (RAC), we performed a multicenter retrospective study over a five-year period (2013 to 2017). All adult-witnessed OHCA who had benefited from either S-CPR or CO-CPR by bystanders were included. Non-medical causes as well as professional rescuers as witnesses were excluded. The primary end point was 30-day neurological outcome in a weighted population for all medical causes, and then for asphyxial, non-asphyxial and cardiac causes. Results: Of the 8 541 subjects included for all medical causes, 6 742 had a non-asphyxial etiology, including 5 904 of cardiac causes, and 1 799 had an asphyxial OHCA.

The present study investigated the relationship between ASMI and the bone mineral density (BMD) categories of postmenopausal women. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study with a probabilistic sample, sociodemographic, lifestyle, menopause time, anthropometric, and physical activity variables were collected. ASMI and BMD were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Participants were grouped according to BMD values into normal density, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Multivariate logistic regression models were applied to verify the influence of ASMI on BMD. Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software, version 22. The significance level for all tests was set at 5%. RESULTS: Of the 114 women analyzed, most were between 60 and 69.9 years of age (62.3%), on menopause for 19.0 (51.8%), self-declared brown race/color (49.1%), had < 4 years of education (41.2%), never smoked (69.0%) or drank alcohol (62.8%).

There was an association between the 1st tertile of ASMI and osteoporosis. However, after adjustments for age, race/color, and body mass index, the strength of association between BMD and ASMI was not maintained.

A decline in the rates of primary PCI has been observed globally during the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Fear of exposure to in-hospital infection has been hypothesized as the main mechanism of this phenomenon, also contributing to a delayed presentation of patients with STEMI. However, a formal assessment of initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) among STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is still lacking. We therefore compared pre-hospital ECGs of STEMI patients hospitalized in Italy after the first reported case of COVID-19 on 21 February 2020 with data from the same period in 2019 to identifying potential changes between the two periods. Methods and results Prehospital ECGs were obtained from the STEMI care network in the Campania region. Deidentified ECGs were analysed by two expert reviewers who were blinded to date of recording. Pathological Q-waves were defined as a Q-wave with a duration 40 ms and/or depth 25% of the R-wave in the same lead or the presence of a Q-wave equivalent. These criteria have been shown to be associated with final infarct size at cardiac magnetic resonance. For all conventional STEMI, the timing of STEMI onset was estimated with the Anderson-Wilkins (AW) acuteness score, ranging from 1 (least acute) to 4 (most acute). From 21 February 2020 to 16 April 2020, a total of 3239 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded by the emergency medical system and 167 (5.15%) were classified as STEMI. During the same period in 2019, 3505 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded, and 196 (5.59%) were classified as STEMI. There was no difference between the two study periods in terms of age, gender, type, and location of STEMI (Table 1). Pathological Q-waves were present in 54.5% of ECGs recorded during the COVID-19 period compared with 22.1% of ECGs recorded in the same period in 2019 (risk difference 32.3, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 21.2C43.5 percentage points). There was also an increase in the mean number of Q-waves during the COVID-19 compared with the control period (1.4 vs. 0.9;P < 0.001). These findings remained similar when QS- and qR complexes were analysed separately. Consistently, the AW score was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (2.4 vs. 2.8;P < 0.001). Conclusions Prehospital ECGs of STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic presented more frequently with signs of late ischemia compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Approximately, one out of two patients had already pathological Q-waves in the initial ECG. The AW acuteness score is superior to patient history (historical timing) in predicting myocardial salvage and mortality after reperfusion in STEMI patients, thus explaining the higher mortality rate and the increased risk of infarct-related complications observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Prehospital ECG in patients with acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe risk of outbreaks escalating into pandemics has soared with globalization. Therefore, understanding transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases has become critical to formulating global public health policy. This systematic review assessed evidence in the medical and public health literature for the military as a disease vector. MethodsWe searched 3 electronic databases without temporal restrictions. Two researchers independently extracted study data using a standardized form. Through team discussions, studies were grouped according to their type of transmission mechanism and direct quotes were extracted to generate themes and sub-themes. A content analysis was later performed and frequency distributions for each theme were generated. ResultsOf 6477 studies, 210 met our inclusion criteria and provided evidence, spanning over two centuries (1810 - 2020), for the military as a pathogen transmitter, within itself or between it and civilians. Biological mechanisms driving transmission included person-to-person transmission, contaminated food and water, vector-borne, and airborne routes. Contaminated food and/or water were the most common biological transmission route. Social mechanisms facilitating transmission included crowded living spaces, unhygienic conditions, strenuous working, training conditions, absent or inadequate vaccination programs, pressure from military leadership, poor compliance with public health advice, contractor mismanagement, high-risk behaviours, and occupation-specific freedom of movement. Living conditions were the most common social transmission mechanism, with young, low ranking military personnel repeatedly reported as the most affected group. Selected social mechanisms, such as employment-related freedom of movement, were unique to the military as a social institution. While few studies explicitly studied civilian populations, considerably more contained information that implied that civilians were likely impacted by outbreaks described in the military. ConclusionsThis study identified features of the military that pose a significant threat to global health, especially to civilian health in countries with substantial military presence or underdeveloped health systems. While biological transmission mechanisms are shared by other social groups, selected social transmission mechanisms are unique to the military. As an increasingly interconnected world faces the challenges of COVID-19 and future infectious diseases, the identified features of the military may exacerbate current and similar challenges and impair attempts to implement successful and equitable global public health policies.","output":"The military as a neglected pathogen transmitter and its implications for COVID-19: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endophytic fungi have proven to be prolific producers of bioactive secondary metabolites with agricultural applications.

Pre-existing CD8(+) T-cell immunity directed towards conserved internal viral regions can greatly ameliorate the disease. However, mutational escape within the T cell epitopes is a substantial issue for virus control and vaccine design. Although mutations can result in a loss of T cell recognition, some variants generate cross-reactive T cell responses. In this study, we used reverse genetics to modify the influenza NP(336C374) peptide at a partially-solvent exposed residue (N->A, NPN3A mutation) to assess the availability, effectiveness and mechanism underlying influenza-specific cross-reactive T cell responses. The engineered virus induced a diminished CD8(+) T cell response and selected a narrowed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire within two V regions (V8.3 and V9). This can be partially explained by the H-2D(b)NPN3A structure that showed a loss of several contacts between the NPN3A peptide and H-2D(b), including a contact with His155, a position known to play an important role in mediating TCR-pMHC-I interactions. Despite these differences, common cross-reactive TCRs were detected in both the na?ve and immune NPN3A-specific TCR repertoires. However, while the NPN3A epitope primes memory T-cells that give an equivalent recall response to the mutant or wild-type (wt) virus, both are markedly lower than wt->wt challenge. Such decreased CD8(+) responses elicited after heterologous challenge resulted in delayed viral clearance from the infected lung. Furthermore, mice first exposed to the wt virus give a poor, low avidity response following secondary infection with the mutant.

The prolonged time looking at the monitor may cause fatigue, which can subsequently impact the mental and physical health. A fatigue detection system is needed to monitor the Internet users well-being. Previous research related to the fatigue detection system used a fuzzy system, but the accuracy was below 85%. In this research, machine learning is used to improve accuracy. Objective: This research examines the combination of the Face Net algorithm with either k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) or multiclass support vector machine (SVM) to improve the accuracy. Methods: In this study, we used the UTA-RLDD dataset. The features used for fatigue detection come from the face, so the dataset is segmented using the Haar Cascades method, which is then resized. The feature extraction process uses FaceNet's pre-trained algorithm. The extracted features are classified into three classesfocused, unfocused, and fatigueusing the K-NN or multiclass SVM method. Results: The combination between the FaceNet algorithm and K-NN, with a value of resulted in a better accuracy than the FaceNet algorithm with multiclass SVM with the polynomial kernel (at 94.68% and 89.87% respectively). The processing speed of both combinations of methods has allowed for real-time data processing.

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) engages and regulates several innate immune response pathways during infection. We have previously shown that the SARS-CoV Papain-like Protease (PLpro) inhibits type I interferon (IFN) by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation thereby blocking downstream Interferon induction. This finding prompted us to identify other potential mechanisms of inhibition of PLpro on IFN induction. METHODS: We have used plasmids expressing PLpro and IRF3 including an IRF3 mutant that is constitutively active, called IRF3(5D). In these experiments we utilize transfections, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Electro-mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) and protein localization to identify where IRF3 and IRF3(5D) are inhibited by PLpro. RESULTS: Here we show that PLpro also inhibits IRF3 activation at a step after phosphorylation and that this inhibition is dependent on the de-ubiquitination (DUB) activity of PLpro. We found that PLpro is able to block the type I IFN induction of a constitutively active IRF3, but does not inhibit IRF3 dimerization, nuclear localization or DNA binding. However, inhibition of PLpros DUB activity by mutagenesis blocked the IRF3 inhibition activity of PLpro, suggesting a role for IRF3 ubiquitination in induction of a type I IFN innate immune response. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate an additional mechanism that PLpro is able to inhibit IRF3 signaling. These data suggest novel innate immune antagonism activities of PLpro that may contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis.","output":"The SARS coronavirus papain like protease can inhibit IRF3 at a post activation step that requires deubiquitination activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All-inclusive, more than 20 million individuals have been infected with the COVID-19, with the most number of cases from the United States, trailed by Brazil and India In perspective on this developing extent of the number of cases, forecasting models are exceptionally useful to be prepared to confront the pandemic circumstance In this work, we have used an efficient time series based Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to forecast the COVID-19 cases in India We have trained the system with data from 3 March 2020 to 7 August 2020 and we have forecasted the values from 8 August 2020 to 9 September 2020 We have seen that the total no of cases will get doubled, i e reaches 40 Lakhs by the end of the forecasted period Along with this forecast we have done the multi-level validation of our work using metrics, r-squared error (R2), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE)","output":"Simple forecasting model for covid-19 cases in India - Multilevel model evaluation with R2, MSE, and MAE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este artculo analiza la evolucin de la economa colombiana durantecla pandemia de COVID-19 desde una perspectiva agregada, as como la poltica fiscal adoptada para enfrentar la crisis desatada por la enfermedad Argumenta que en la coyuntura actual el objetivo principal de la poltica macroeconmica debera ser aumentar el nivel de empleo y que la austeridad fiscal adoptada por el gobierno nacional no lleva a ese fin Adems, considera el papel de la tributacin en este contexto y examina los programas que el gobierno emprendi en uso de facultades de emergencia a la luz de la necesidad de un marco econmico e institucional que ayude a enfrentar eficazmente crisis socioeconmicas y desastres naturales","output":"Situacin econmica, poltica fiscal y pandemia en Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The academic literature contains little information regarding the interventions that create age-friendly cities and communities in order to promote active ageing. Objectives: A systematic review was carried out to determine the available empirical evidence in relation to the characteristics, content and effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving environmental and psychosocial risk factors for older people, from the perspective of age-friendly communities and the promotion of active ageing. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the studies retained in this review were identified through a systematic search of the academic literature in selected electronic databases including Web of Science and Scopus. Independent critical appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two reviewers. The checklist was used to assess the quality of the articles. Findings: The search identified 1020 potentially eligible documents, of which 11 satisfied the established criteria. Non-exhaustive practices prevailed over rigorous investigations, with a high proportion of studies observed to be of low methodological quality and at high risk of bias. This reflected the predominance of uncontrolled interventions. Environmental interventions were focused on reducing risk and adapting the everyday environmental setting, while psychosocial interventions prioritised social strategies (behavioural changes, promotion of participation) and training. Interventions were more effective in certain domains of age-friendly cities and communities such as transportation and housing, followed by increased participation as a lifestyle-related behavioural change. The inferred changes were associated with providing information and enhancing skills; modifying access, barriers, exposures, and opportunities; enhancing services and support; continuity and effectiveness of changes over time; and modifying policies based on the bottom-up approach of age-friendly cities and communities (AFCC). Discussion and conclusion: Interventions focused on personal and organisational aspects might have positive effects in the longer term. However, fewer changes would be observed in interventions revolving around changing lifestyles owing to the impact of complex multi-causal factors. The relative effectiveness in terms of health calls into question the design of interventions and the supposed friendliness of certain communities.

According to the Alzheimer's Society there are over 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, costing the UK 26 billion in 2013. Therefore, research into treatment of those conditions is vital. Research into the cerebral endothelial glycocalyx (CeGC) could offer effective treatments. The CeGC, consisting of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids, is a dynamic structure covering the luminal side oftheendothelial cells of capillaries throughout the body. The CeGC is thicker in cerebral micro vessels, suggesting specialisation for its function as part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent research evidences that the CeGC is vital in protecting fragile parenchymal tissue and effective functioning of the BBB, as one particularly important CeGC function is to act as a protective barrier and permeability regulator. CeGC degradation is one of the factors which can lead to an increase in BBB permeability. It occurs naturally in aging, nevertheless, premature degradationhas beenevidencedin multipleconditions linked to cognitive impairment, such as inflammation,brain edema, cerebral malaria, Alzheimer's and recently Covid-19. Increasing knowledge of the mechanisms of CeGC damage has led to research into preventative techniques showing that CeGC is a possible diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target. However, the evidence is relatively new, inconsistent and demonstrated mainly in experimental models. This review evaluates the current knowledge of the CeGC, its structure, functions, damage and repair mechanisms and the impact of its degeneration on cognitive impairment in multiple conditions, highlighting the CeGC as a possible diagnostic marker and a potential target for therapeutic treatment.","output":"Cerebral microvascular endothelial glycocalyx damage, its implications on the blood-brain barrier and a possible contributor to cognitive impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus. Patients with COVID-19 infection can present with thrombosis in the setting of inflammation (thromboinflammation), presumably from endothelial dysfunction, or endotheliopathy. Yu et al demonstrated in vitro that the spike protein subunit of SARS-COV2 acts as a potent activator of the alternative complement pathway (AP), one of three complement pathways within the innate immune system. Satyam et alreported the deposition of complement components on lung tissue of patients who succumbed to COVID-19, consistent with activation of classical and alternate pathways. These studies suggest complement dysregulation potentially causing endotheliopathy in COVID-19 patients. Thrombomodulin (TM) is an endothelial glycoprotein that plays two crucial roles in maintaining a healthy endothelium - as a natural anticoagulant and a negative regulator of complement. TM shed into the circulation due to endothelial injury can be measured in the plasma as soluble TM (sTM). Goshua et al showed elevated sTM in an adult cohort of patients with COVID-19. However, it is yet to be demonstrated if there is any correlation between endothelial injury and AP activation in COVID-19, or if either play a role in clinical outcome in the pediatric population. Objective: To 1) assess endothelial injury and AP activation in a cohort of critically ill pediatric patients with COVID-19 by measuring sTM and Ba (an AP activation product); 2) determine the correlation between endothelial injury and AP activation; and 3) analyze the utility of sTM and Ba in predicting pediatric clinical outcomes. Methods: We collected plasma samples of patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 between Dec 2, 2020 and Jan 22, 2021 at Texas Children's Hospital. For controls, we collected plasma samples from pediatric patients undergoing preoperative clearance, all at their baseline state of health. sTM levels and Ba levels were measured in plasma samples using commercially available TM and Ba ELISA kits. sTM greater than 7.6 ng/ml (based on the assay range in adults) and Ba greater than 1080 ng/ml (based on data from adult healthy controls) were considered elevated. Data regarding demographics, length of ICU stay, clinical indicators of end organ damage- mechanical ventilation, dialysis, use of vasopressors, ECMO, mortality were obtained retrospectively via chart review. Inclusion criteria included all patients with a positive SARS-COV2 PCR admitted to the ICU. Exclusion criteria was age greater than 21 years, pregnant female, patients with known inflammatory or complement-mediated disorders. Statistical analysis: For sTM and Ba levels between control and COVID-19 patients, mean +/- standard deviation was calculated and significance determined with an unpaired t-test. Fischer exact test, Wilcoxon rank sum and Pearson product-moment correlation tests were used for statistical analysis of clinical outcomes as appropriate. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 38 control patients and 33 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Ba and sTM levels were both significantly higher in the COVID-19 pediatric patients compared to the controls (Fig. 1). Within the COVID-19 patient cohort, 61% (n=20) had elevated sTM and 42% (n=14) had elevated Ba levels. There was a moderately positive correlation between sTM and plasma Ba levels in the COVID-19 cohort (Fig. 2). Within the COVID-19 patients' cohort, though higher Ba levels were not associated with an increased rate of intubation, they were associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation (p=.039) for those intubated (Table 1). Elevated sTM was associated with increased vasopressor use (p=.011). Although other clinical outcome variables did not reach statistical significance likely owing to small numbers, overall trend indicated worse outcomes in patients with elevated sTM. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that SARS-COV-2 activates AP and causes endothelial injury in children. The positive correlation between sTM and Ba suggest interplay between inflammation, coagulation and endotheliopathy supporting thromboinflammation in COVID-19. Higher sTM and Ba levels indicated worse clinical outcomes in children, but larger studies are needed to confirm our findings.

OBJECTIVES: We elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which the cyclophilin inhibitors Cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) restrict MERS-CoV to validate their suitability as readily-available therapy in MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: Calu-3 cells and primary human alveolar epithelial cells (hAEC) were infected with MERS-CoV and treated with CsA or ALV or inhibitors targeting cyclophilin inhibitor-regulated molecules including Calcineurin, NFAT, or MAP kinases. Novel CsA-induced pathways were identified by RNA sequencing and manipulated by gene knockdown or neutralising antibodies. Viral replication was quantified by qRT-PCR and TCID50. Data were validated in a murine MERS-CoV infection model. RESULTS: CsA and ALV both reduced MERS-CoV titers and viral RNA replication in Calu-3 and hAEC improving epithelial integrity. While neither Calcineurin nor NFAT inhibition reduced MERS-CoV propagation, blockade of c-Jun N-terminal kinase diminished infectious viral particle release but not RNA accumulation. Importantly, CsA induced interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), a pronounced type-III-interferon (IFN&#955;) response and expression of antiviral genes. Down-regulation of IRF1 or IFN&#955; increased MERS-CoV propagation in presence of CsA. Importantly, oral application of CsA reduced MERS-CoV replication in vivo, correlating with elevated lung IFN&#955; levels and improved outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that cyclophilin inhibitors efficiently decrease MERS-CoV replication in vitro and in vivo via upregulation of inflammatory, antiviral cell responses, in particular IFN&#955;. CsA might therefore represent a promising candidate to treat MERS-CoV infection.","output":"Cyclophilin Inhibitors Restrict Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Via Interferon  In Vitro And In Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug compulsion manifests in some but not all individuals and implicates multifaceted processes including failures in top-down cognitive control as drivers for the hazardous pursuit of drug use in some individuals. As a closely related construct, impulsivity encompasses rash or risky behaviour without foresight, and underlies most forms of drug taking behaviour, including drug use during adverse emotional states (i.e., negative urgency). While impulsive behavioural dimensions emerge from drug-induced brain plasticity, burgeoning evidence suggests that impulsivity also predates the emergence of compulsive drug use. Although the neural substrates underlying the apparently causal relationship between trait impulsivity and drug compulsion are poorly understood, significant advances have come from the interrogation of defined limbic cortico-striatal circuits involved in motivated behaviour and response inhibition, together with chemical neuromodulatory influences from the ascending neurotransmitter systems. We review what is presently known about the neurochemical mediation of impulsivity, in its various forms, and ask whether commonalities exist in the neurochemistry of compulsive drug-motivated behaviours that might explain individual risk for addiction.","output":"Neurochemical substrates linked to impulsive and compulsive phenotypes in addiction: a preclinical perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Healthcare-associated infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, are among the most common adverse events in healthcare, and of them, pneumonia is the most commonly reported. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence and clinical outcome of respiratory viruses in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods: This was a prospective cohort study, include patients aged between 0 and 18 who fulfilled Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for HAP. Demographic and clinical data were obtained, and a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was taken for the detection of respiratory viruses. All included patients were monitored until discharge to collect data on the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. All-cause 30-day mortality was also ascertained. Results: Four thousand three hundred twenty-seven patients were followed for 42,658 patient-days and 5,150 ventilator-days. Eighty-eight patients (2.03%) met the CDC criteria for HAP, 63 patients were included, and clinical and epidemiological characteristics showed no statistically significant differences between patients with virus associated healthcare-associated pneumonia (VAHAP) and those with non-viral healthcare-associated pneumonia (NVHAP). At least one respiratory virus was detected in 65% [95% CI (53C77)] of episodes of HAP, with a single viral pathogen observed in 53.9% and coinfection with 2 viruses in 11.1% of cases. The outcome in terms of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and the 30-day mortality did not show a significant difference between groups. Conclusions: In two-thirds of the patients a respiratory virus was identified. There was no difference in mortality or the rest of the clinical outcome variables. About half of the patients required mechanical ventilation and 10% died, which emphasizes the importance of considering these pathogens in nosocomial infections, since their identification can influence the decrease in hospital costs and be taken into account in infection control policies.","output":"Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia: Don't Forget About Respiratory Viruses!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thermoeconomic analysis, a combined application of thermodynamic and economic analyses, has emerged as an important tool to optimize the performance of desalination systems Contrary to conventional economic analysis, it offers flexibility to investigate and improve the performance of each component in the system, individually The current paper presents a comprehensive framework for conducting thermoeconomic analysis of desalination systems In this regard, different energy calculation methods are discussed first Then a detailed review of theoretical developments of thermoeconomic analyses is conducted to summarize the correlations/magnitude of important economic parameters This is followed by a discussion on cost balance equations for important desalination components Finally, a systematic thermoeconomic analysis model is developed for the mechanical vapor compression desalination system operating under different arrangements as an example The monetary value of each stream calculated using appropriate fiscal parameters in the system is presented in the form of a cost flow diagram The study can be used to conduct the thermoeconomic analysis of other commercial desalination systems","output":"A comprehensive framework for thermoeconomic analysis of desalination systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For many decades, children from low-income families have been able to receive free or reduced-price lunches and breakfasts at their school.

So far, no effective vaccine is known to combat HTLV-1, hence, the current research work was performed to design a potential multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine (MEBV) by adopting the latest methodology of reverse vaccinology. Briefly, three highly antigenic proteins (Glycoprotein, Accessory protein, and Tax protein) with no or minimal (<37%) similarity with human proteome were sorted out and potential B- and T-cell epitopes were forecasted from them. Highly antigenic, immunogenic, non-toxic, non-allergenic and overlapping epitopes were short-listed for vaccine development. The chosen T-cell epitopes displayed a strong binding affinity with their corresponding Human Leukocyte Antigen alleles and demonstrated 95.8% coverage of the worlds population. Finally, nine Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes, six Helper T Lymphocytes and five Linear B Lymphocytes epitopes, joint through linkers and adjuvant, were exploited to design the final MEBV construct, comprising of 382 amino acids. The developed MEBV structure showed highly antigenic properties while being non-toxic, soluble, non-allergenic, and stable in nature. Moreover, disulphide engineering further enhanced the stability of the final vaccine protein. Additionally, Molecular docking analysis and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the strong association between MEBV construct and human pathogenic immune receptor TLR-3. Repeated-exposure simulations and Immune simulations ensured the rapid antigen clearance and higher levels of cell-mediated immunity, respectively. Furthermore, MEBV codon optimization and in-silico cloning was carried out to confirm its augmented expression. Results of our experiments suggested that the proposed MEBV could be a potential immunogenic against HTLV-1; nevertheless, additional wet lab experiments are needed to elucidate our conclusion.","output":"Rational design of chimeric Multiepitope Based Vaccine (MEBV) against human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1: An integrated vaccine informatics and molecular docking based approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prone positioning has been used as an intervention to improve oxygenation in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. During the COVID-19 pandemic, resources were even more limited given a surge in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, which outstripped intensive care unit (ICU) capacity at many institutions. LOCAL PROBLEM: The purpose of this article is to describe the development and implementation of a proning team during the surge in ICU patients with COVID-19 and to measure the impact of the program through surveys of staff involved. METHODS/INTERVENTIONS: A proning protocol and educational plan was developed. A proning team of redeployed staff was created. A survey of ICU registered nurses and proning team members was used to evaluate the benefits and challenges of the proning team. RESULTS: The proning team was successful in safely performing more than 300 proning and supinating maneuvers for critically ill patients. There is overwhelming support within the institution for a proning team for future COVID-19 surges. DISCUSSION: The development and implementation of the proning team happened quickly to assist with the surge of patients and off-load work from ICU registered nurses. Despite the success of the proning team, more clearly defined roles and expectations, as well as additional education, are needed to further enhance teamwork and workflow. CONCLUSIONS: Creation of the proning team was a creative use of resources that helped manage the large and medically complex patient population.

Three of the bacteria, Lactobacillus ruminis SPM0211, Bifidobacterium longum SPM1205, and SPM1206, inhibited human strain Wa rotavirus infection in Caco-2 cells.

We analyzed the differences in patterns of ED visits in Italy during the two pandemic waves, focusing on changes in accesses for acute and chronic diseases. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study using data from a metropolitan area in northern Italy that includes twelve ED. We analyzed weekly trends in non-COVID-19 ED visits during the first (FW) and second wave (SW) of the pandemic. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of triage codes, patient destination, and cause-specific ED visits in the FW and SW of the year 2020 vs. 2019 were estimated using Poisson regression models. MAIN FINDINGS We found a significant decrease of ED visits by triage code, which was more marked for low priority codes and during the FW. We found an increased share of hospitalizations compared to home discharges both in the FW and in the SW. ED visits for acute and chronic conditions decreased during the FW, ranging, from -70% for injuries (IRR = 0.2862, p < 0.001) to -50% and - 60% for ischemic heart disease and heart failure.

Around one third of the DNA trace profiles registered in the Swiss DNA database are related to burglaries. However, during the collection of potential DNA traces within someones residence after a burglary, it is not known whether the sampled DNA originated from the perpetrator or from an inhabitant of said home. Because of the high incidence of burglaries, crime scene investigators usually do not collect reference samples from all the residents for economical and administrative reasons. Therefore, the presumably high probability that a DNA profile belonging to a person authorized to be at the crime scene ends up being sent to a DNA database for comparison, has to be taken into account. To our knowledge, no investigation has been made to evaluate the percentage of these non-perpetrator profiles straying into DNA databases. To shed light on this question, we collected reference samples from residents who had been victims of recent burglaries in their private homes. By comparing the profiles established from these reference samples with the profiles generated from trace DNA, we can show that the majority of the DNA samples collected in burglary investigations belong to the residents. Despite the limited number of cases included in the study, presumably due to a crime decline caused by the pandemic, we further show that trace DNA collection in the vicinity of the break and entry area, in particular window and door glasses, is most promising for sampling perpetrator instead of inhabitant DNA.","output":"Efficient DNA Sampling in Burglary Investigations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has presented a lot of learning for the community through various new information and vocabulary related to the nature and meaning of COVID-19.

They are abundant in the human peripheral blood and also enriched in mucosal layers and in the lungs, SARS-CoV-2's main ports of entry. Once activated, MAIT cells produce inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic effector molecules quickly and copiously. MAIT cells are best known for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. However, they are also activated during viral infections, typically in a cytokine-dependent manner, which may promote antiviral immunity. On the other hand, it is plausible to assume active roles for MAIT cells in infection-provoked cytokine storms and tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic, mild, severe, or even fatal, depending on sex, age, the presence of preexisting morbidities, and the individual's immunological competence, or lack thereof, among other factors. Based on the available literature, I propose that MAIT cells regulate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and constitute attractive targets in the prevention or clinical management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and some of its complications. Unlike mainstream T cells, MAIT cells are restricted by a monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule called MHC-related protein 1 (MR1).

Policies put in place to curb the tide of the pandemic resulted in a decrease of patient volumes throughout the ambulatory system. The future implications of COVID-19 in healthcare are still unknown, specifically the continued impact on the ambulatory landscape. The primary objective of this study is to accurately forecast the number of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 weekly visits in primary care practices. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a single health system in Delaware. All patients records were abstracted from our electronic health records system (EHR) from January 1, 2019 to July 25, 2020. Patient demographics and comorbidities were compared using t-tests, Chi square, and Mann Whitney U analyses as appropriate. ARIMA time series models were developed to provide an 8-week future forecast for two ambulatory practices (AmbP) and compare it to a na?ve moving average approach. Results Among the 271,530 patients considered during this study period, 4,195 patients (1.5%) were identified as COVID-19 patients. The best fitting ARIMA models for the two AmbP are as follows: AmbP1 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(4,0,1), AmbP1 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(2,0,1), AmbP2 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(1,1,1), and AmbP2 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(1,0,0). Discussion and Conclusion: Accurately predicting future patient volumes in the ambulatory setting is essential for resource planning and developing safety guidelines.

Obstetrics and gynaecology trainees in the West Midlands have adapted to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic despite significant impact on their training, working practices and wellbeing. It is important to tailor training to improve trainees' education and combat lost training time during the pandemic. This should be considered for long-term shaping of the obstetrics and gynaecology training pathway.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Little research is available about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetrics and gynaecology trainees. This is the first study of its kind to assess the effect of the pandemic on obstetrics ang gynaecology trainees in the United Kingdom.What do the results of this study add? The results of this study have shown that obstetrics and gynaecology training has been heavily affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been significant impacts on their training, working patterns and physical and mental wellbeing.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? These findings can be used to mould the obstetrics and gynaecology training pathway based on the feedback given by the trainees during the pandemic. The survey questions can also be utilised as a framework for similar research projects across the United Kingdom Deaneries, among other specialties and around the world.","output":"The effect of the measures taken during the coronavirus pandemic on specialty trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology in the United Kingdom: an online questionnaire survey in one region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People living with a degenerative retinal disease such as retinitis pigmentosa are oftentimes faced with difficulties navigating in crowded places and avoiding obstacles due to their severely limited field of view.

Using a virtual reality headset with eye tracking, we simulated tunnel vision of 20 in diameter in visually healthy participants (n = 9). Employing this setup, we investigated how different scanning patterns influence the dynamic field of viewthe average area over time covered by the field of viewof the participants in an obstacle avoidance task and in a search task. One of the two tested scanning patterns showed a significant improvement in both dynamic field of view (navigation 11%, search 7%) and collision avoidance (33%) when compared to trials without the suggested scanning pattern. However, participants took significantly longer (31%) to finish the navigation task when applying this scanning pattern.

In the relative absence of formal infrastructures, people informally forge their own connections, capacities and opportunities so that they are able to access the social support they requirewhen needed. Recognizing this trend, this paper argues that there is a greater need for epidemic program planners to recognize and leverage the potential social infrastructure of informal communities and self-governance mechanisms during a disease epidemic. This need highlights the importance of tapping into already existing networks of social capital that can be readily mobilized during an epidemic to achieve a more rapid response. The empirical basis of our arguments draws primarily on qualitative research in informal settlements of Freetown, Sierra Leone and Monrovia, Liberia, following the 2014C16 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks. Our research reveals that distrust in government and inadequacies in the official response were identified as primary factors accounting for the severity of the EVD outbreaks in informal settlements. Overall, the research stresses the importance of adopting community-based approaches to infectious disease response that explicitly builds on context-specific knowledge pertaining to locally-based informal social arrangements, governance mechanisms and the local political history in which the informal settlement is embedded.","output":"Mobilizing the social infrastructure of informal settlements in infectious disease response C The case of Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had rapidly spread since FEB/MAR 2020. Policy to prevent transmission of COVDI-19 resulted in multi-dimensional impact on social interaction. We aimed to develop a beneficial survey tool with favorable quality and availability, the Societal Influences Survey Questionnaire (SISQ), to evaluate social influences on people during this pandemic. The SISQ was developed with 15 items and 4-point Likert scales consisting of five factors. These include social distance, social anxiety, social desirability, social information, and social adaptation. Construct validity and reliability were performed to verify the SISQ. A total of 1912 Taiwanese were recruited. The results demonstrated that the SISQ has acceptable reliability, with Cronbach's alphas ranging between 0.57 and 0.76. The SISQ accounted for 58.86% and satisfied the requirement of Kaiser-Mayer-Olkinvalues (0.78) and significant Bartlett's Test of sphericity. Moreover, the confirmatory factor analysis fit indices also indicated the adequacy of the model. As for multiple comparison, females scored higher than males in factor of social distance. Unemployed participants and those without partners scored higher in several domains of factors. The survey method and survey instrument prove reliable and valuable, also providing different categories of assessment results regarding social influences and their impacts.

The study will categorize and quantify the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) in a cohort of MS patients recruited from clinical sites around the UK. The study was motivated particularly by a need to establish the safety profile of newer DMTs, but will also gather data on outcomes among treatment-eligible but untreated patients and those receiving established DMTs (interferons and glatiramer acetate). It will also explore the impact of treatment switching. METHODS: Causal pathway confounding between treatment selection and outcomes, together with the variety and complexity of treatment and disease patterns observed among MS patients in the real world, present statistical challenges to be addressed in the analysis plan. We developed an approach for analysis of the Optimise:MS data that will include disproportionality-based signal detection methods adapted to the longitudinal structure of the data and a longitudinal time-series analysis of a cohort of participants receiving second-generation DMT for the first time. The time-series analyses will use a number of exposure definitions in order to identify temporal patterns, carryover effects and interactions with prior treatments. Time-dependent confounding will be allowed for via inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW). Additional analyses will examine rates and outcomes of pregnancies and explore interactions of these with treatment type and duration. RESULTS: To date 14 hospitals have joined the study and over 2,000 participants have been recruited. A statistical analysis plan has been developed and is described here. CONCLUSION: Optimise:MS is expected to be a rich source of data on the outcomes of DMTs in real-world conditions over several years of follow-up in an inclusive sample of UK MS patients. Analysis is complicated by the influence of confounding factors including complex treatment histories and a highly variable disease course, but the statistical analysis plan includes measures to mitigate the biases such factors can introduce. It will enable us to address key questions that are beyond the reach of randomized controlled trials.","output":"Challenges and Opportunities of Real-World Data: Statistical Analysis Plan for the Optimise:MS Multicenter Prospective Cohort Pharmacovigilance Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent trend in the food industry of a developing country like India is to produce food products that will provide nutritional health benefits beyond their intrinsic natural nutrient content.

It helps in overcoming the geographical physical barrier, increasing access to the healthcare services. Telemedicine has been growing in Nepal, with several hospitals and medical organizations providing services since 2006. COVID\\\\19 pandemic ignited significant interests in it, which previously remained unnoticed, realizing its importance for the present and future. The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitude toward telemedicine among medical students in Nepal. METHODS: An observational study among medical students in 19 medical colleges in Nepal was performed from May to June using Google forms. The survey consisted of 27 questions including information on demography and telemedicine exposure, its status in Nepal, interest, and plans for its future utilization. RESULTS: Of 146 total surveyed students, 77.4% (n = 113) provided their views regarding telemedicine. Among students with knowledge of telemedicine, only 8.8% (n = 10) had attended some training. Only 6% (n = 4) of those who had previously consulted through telemedicine labeled their experience as poor. Exactly 88.5% (n = 100) were not satisfied with present telemedicine practices and coverage and 43.4% (n = 49) were optimistic about using telemedicine in future. Irrespective of location of medical colleges (Kathmandu Valley or outside) or levels of study (preclinical or clinical), students had similar knowledge and attitude regarding telemedicine. CONCLUSION: The participants have good knowledge regarding the importance of telemedicine but only few of them are educated regarding its usage. Despite limited exposure to telemedicine, participants advocate for expansion and wide use of telemedicine due to economy, technological advancement, and topographic diversities. Internet, sense of reliability, privacy issue, and lack of proper curriculum seem to have raised question on their positive attitude.

Antihistamines are safe and effective treatments for reducing inflammation and cytokine release. Combinations of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor antagonists have been effective in urticaria, and might reduce the histamine-mediated pulmonary cytokine storm in COVID-19. Can a combination of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor blockers improve COVID-19 inpatient outcomes? METHODS: A physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine was performed in hospitalized patients with severe to critical pulmonary symptoms. Pulmonologists led the inpatient care in a single medical center of 110 high-acuity patients that were treated with cetirizine 10 mg b.i.d. and famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. plus standard-of-care. RESULTS: Of all patients, including those with Do Not Resuscitate directives, receiving the dual-histamine receptor blockade for at least 48 h, the combination drug treatment resulted in a 16.4% rate of intubation, a 7.3% rate of intubation after a minimum of 48 h of treatment, a 15.5% rate of inpatient mortality, and 11.0 days duration of hospitalization. The drug combination exhibited beneficial reductions in inpatient mortality and symptom progression when compared to published reports of COVID-19 inpatients. Concomitant medications were assessed and hydroxychloroquine was correlated with worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine provides proof-of-concept of a safe and effective method to reduce the progression in symptom severity, presumably by minimizing the histamine-mediated cytokine storm.

The most common agent causing viral infections in patients with CF before the age of 3 years is respiratory syncytial virus. OBJECTIVES: To obtain the prevalence of the different types of viral infection in CF patients and to identify its relation with the type of bacterial infection, (CFTR) mutations and pulmonary function test (PFT). METHODOLOGY: A retrospective charts review of 387 patients with CF of all age groups who were screened for the detection of viruses during respiratory exacerbation from the period of January 1, 1984 to June 1, 2016. RESULTS: A total of 159 CF patients had pulmonary exacerbation and had viral PCR obtained. Fifty-eight patients (36%) had positive viral PCR. Males were more commonly infected in 30/58 patients (52%) compared to females in 28 patients (48%). Forty-five of 58 patients (78%) were alive and 13 patients (22%) died. Rhinovirus was the most frequently reported viral PCR in 33/74 sample (45%). Out of 74 viral PCR, 41 (55.4%) were during the colder seasons (OctoberCFebruary) and 33 (44.5%) during the warmer seasons (MarchCSeptember). During viral infection and viral recurrence, there was an increase in bacterial colonization specifically of H. influenza and staphylococcus aureus. The most common CFTR mutation for the CF viral infection is: 3120+1G>A in Intron 16 in 11/57 patients (19%). The Eastern Province had the highest viral infection of 24 out of 57 patients (42%). Follow-up PFT post viral infection showed no significant difference in the type and the severity of PFT compared to the initial PFT during the viral illness. CONCLUSION: Viral infections contributed to the increase in morbidity and mortality of CF patients in our population, and rhinovirus was the most common causative agent. Viral infections and viral recurrence increased the prevalence of bacterial infection of specific pathogens such as H. influenza and S. aureus.

In a pilot phase, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptance of such program. METHODS: The BE THere for diabetes CARE (BETHCARE) project is a real-world PSP conducted through telephone and digital coaching system to provide educational and emotional support to Italian adults with diabetes receiving long-acting basal insulin degludec. This pilot phase was conducted in 11 centres that enrolled a total of 63 patients (89% with type-2 diabetes). Counselors contacted patients to define a set of emotional, physical and nutritional targets, and monitoring calls were performed on a monthly basis. Data were collected on socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics, selected clinical information, quality of life, achievement of targets and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Fifty-eight subjects (92%) chose to participate by telephone and 5 (8%) by mobile app. Most participants (ie, 80%) evaluated counselors calls useful/very useful, duration of calls adequate/adequately long, were satisfied with the educational pathway and declared to be more confident in diabetes management after the program. About half of participants were confident to maintain their targets after the PSP. Achievement of nutritional targets improved during counseling, from a mean score of 1.56 at week 1 to 1.88 at week 16 (p-value = 0.03). No significant variations in the achievement of emotional and physical targets emerged.

Another candidate was prepared by loading Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists as adjuvant into the interior cavity of PhMV-CH401although the addition of the adjuvant conferred no additional immune priming. The VLP-based anti-HER2 vaccine candidate was administered subcutaneously, using a prime-boost immunization schedule and BALB/c mice. The vaccine candidate elicited a strong immune response, including high titers of HER2-specific immunoglobulins and increased the toxicity of antisera to DDHER2 tumor cells.

Copper-free click chemistry and infusion encapsulation protocols were developed to prepare VLPs displaying the HER2-derived CH401 peptide epitope, with and without Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists loaded into the interior cavity of the VLPs;Physalis mottle virus (PhMV)-based VLPs were used. After prime-boost immunization of BALB/c mice through subcutaneous administration of the vaccine candidates, sera were collected and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the CH401-specific antibodies;Th1 vs. Th2 bias was determined by antibody subtyping and splenocyte assay. Efficacy was assessed by tumor challenge using DDHER2 tumor cells. We successful developed two VLP-based anti-HER2 vaccine candidatesPhMV-CH401 vs. CpG-PhMV-CH401;however, the addition of the CpG adjuvant did not confer additional immune priming. Both VLP-based vaccine candidates elicited a strong immune response, including high titers of HER2-specific immunoglobulins and increased toxicity of antisera to DDHER2 tumor cells. DDHER2 tumor growth was delayed, leading to prolonged survival of the vaccinated vs. na?ve BALB/C mice. The PhMV-based anti-HER2 vaccine PhMV-CH401, demonstrated efficacy as an anti-HER2 cancer vaccine.

Few studies exist on the utilization and determinants of timely ANC and use of different types of health facilities at the community level in Bangladesh. This study aims to assess the utilization, timeliness of, and socio-demographic determinants of antenatal and delivery care services in two sub-districts in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data collected through a structured questionnaire in the eRegMat cluster-randomized controlled trial, which enrolled pregnant women between October 2018-June 2020. We undertook univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the associations of socio-demographic variables with timely first ANC, four timely ANC visits, and facility delivery. We considered the associations in the multivariate logistic regression as statistically significant if the p-value was found to be <0.05. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Data were available on 3293 pregnant women. Attendance at a timely first antenatal care visit was 59%. Uptake of four timely antenatal care visits was 4.2%. About three-fourths of the women delivered in a health facility. Women from all socio-economic groups gradually shifted from using public health facilities to private hospitals as the pregnancy advanced. Timely first antenatal care visit was associated with: women over 30 years of age (AOR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.05C2.19); nulliparity (AOR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04C1.62); husbands with >10 years of education (AOR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.09C1.81) and being in the highest wealth quintile (AOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.18C1.89). Facility deliveries were associated with womans age; parity; education; the husbands education, and wealth index. None of the available socio-demographic factors were associated with four timely antenatal care visits. CONCLUSIONS: The study observed socio-demographic inequalities associated with increased utilization of timely first antenatal care visit and facility delivery. The pregnant women, irrespective of wealth shifted from public to private facilities for their antenatal care visits and delivery. To increase the health service utilization and promote good health, maternal health care programs should pay particular attention to young, multiparous women, of low socio-economic status, or with poorly educated husbands.

PURPOSE To describe the study design and methodology of the Manhattan Vision Screening and Follow-up Study in Vulnerable Populations, which aims to investigate whether community-based vision screenings can improve detection and management of glaucoma, vision impairment, cataract, and other eye diseases among vulnerable populations living in affordable housing developments in upper Manhattan. METHODS This 5-year prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled trial consists of vision screening and referral for follow-up eye care among eligible residents aged 40 and older. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and fundus photography are measured. Participants with visual worse than 20/40, or IOP 23-29?mmHg, or unreadable fundus images fail the screening and are scheduled with the on-site optometrist. If IOP is 30?mmHg, participants are assigned as \\"fast-track\\" and referred to ophthalmology. Participants living in seven developments randomized to the Enhanced Intervention Group who fail the screening and need vision correction receive complimentary eyeglasses. Those referred to ophthalmology receive enhanced support with patient navigators to assist with follow-up eye care. Participants living in three developments randomized to the Usual Care Group who fail the screening and need vision correction are given an eyeglasses prescription only and a list of optical shops. No enhanced support is given to the Usual Care Group. All participants referred to ophthalmology are assisted in making their initial eye exam appointment. CONCLUSION This study targets vulnerable populations where they live to ensure improved access to and utilization of eye-care services in those who are least likely to seek eye care.","output":"Manhattan Vision Screening and Follow-up Study in Vulnerable Populations (NYC-SIGHT): Design and Methodology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient: Female, 29-year-old Final Diagnosis: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection Symptoms: Cardiac arrest Medication:  Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Critical Care Medicine OBJECTIVE: Unknown etiology BACKGROUND: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute myocardial infarction, and the literature is undecided on the etiology, predisposing factors, and susceptible populations involved. SCAD is a disease that is under-recognized, underdiagnosed, and mainly affects young women of reproductive age. It has the highest incidence in the third trimester and postpartum period.

The patient was brought in with no cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 20 min. She was resuscitated successfully in the ED. Her initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF). Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) was performed during pulse checks, which revealed no signs of right ventricular strain nor signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). After that, she underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention, which confirmed the diagnosis of right coronary artery dissection.

However, there is uncertainty about the mechanistic pathway for such transmissions. Our objective was to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from primary studies and systematic reviews assessing the role of fomites in transmission. Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar;assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We found 64 studies: 63 primary studies and one systematic review (n=35). The settings for primary studies were predominantly in hospitals (69.8%) including general wards, ICU and SARS-CoV-2 isolation wards. There were variations in the study designs including timing of sample collection, hygiene procedures, ventilation settings and cycle threshold. The overall quality of reporting was low to moderate. The frequency of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests across 51 studies (using RT-PCR) ranged from 0.5% to 75%. Cycle threshold values ranged from 20.8 to 44.1. Viral concentrations were reported in 17 studies;however, discrepancies in the methods for estimation prevented comparison. Eleven studies (17.5%) attempted viral culture, but none found a cytopathic effect. Results of the systematic review showed that healthcare settings were most frequently tested (25/35, 71.4%), but laboratories reported the highest frequency of contaminated surfaces (20.5%, 17/83). Conclusions: The majority of studies report identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on inanimate surfaces;however, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating the recovery of viable virus. Lack of positive viral cultures suggests that the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through fomites is low. Heterogeneity in study designs and methodology prevents comparisons of findings across studies.

STUDY SELECTION Studies evaluating complications in elderly patients treated for distal femur fractures with either immediate DFR or surgical fixation were included. Studies with mean patient age <55 years, nontraumatic indications for DFR, or SF with non-locking plates were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION Two studies provided Level II or III evidence while the remaining 28 studies provided Level IV evidence. Studies were formally evaluated for methodologic quality using established criteria. Treatment failure between groups was compared using an incidence rate ratio. DATA SYNTHESIS Treatment failure was defined for both surgical fixation and arthroplasty as complications requiring a major reoperation for reasons such as mechanical failure, nonunion, deep infection, aseptic loosening, or extensor mechanism disruption. There were no significant differences in complication rates or knee range of motion between SF and DFR. CONCLUSION SF and DFR for the treatment of geriatric distal femur fractures demonstrate similar overall complication rates. Given the available evidence, no strong conclusions on the comparative effectiveness between the two treatments can be definitively made. More rigorous prospective research comparing SF versus DFR to treat acute geriatric distal femur fractures is warranted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic Level IV.

Identifying new biomarkers for early and efficient disease detection is crucial for disease prevention. Compared to the majority of the healthy general population, abnormal values are located within the tails of the biomarker distribution. Thus, parametric regression models that accommodate abnormal values in biomarkers can better detect the association between biomarkers and disease. In this article, we propose semiparametric Gumbel regression models for (1) longitudinal continuous biomarker outcomes, (2) flexibly modeling the time-effect on the outcome, and (3) accounting for the measurement error in biomarker measurements. We adopted the EM algorithm in combination with a two-dimensional grid search to estimate regression parameters and a function of time-effect. We proposed an efficient asymptotic variance estimator for regression parameter estimates. The proposed estimator is asymptotically unbiased in both theory and simulation studies. We applied the proposed model and two other models to investigate associations between fasting blood glucose biomarkers and potential risk factors from a diabetes ancillary study to the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.

Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 10(4) TCID(50) or 10(5) TCID(50), the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 10(5) TCID(50) group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Additionally, we demonstrate that a mild disease course can be simulated by low dose infection with 10(2) TCID(50) SARS-CoV-2, resulting in minimal clinical manifestation and near uniform survival.

One hundred and thirty-one cases from the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, including 67 healthy individuals and 64 non-COVID-19 inpatients, served as the noninfected group. Approximately every 5 days, sera from 20 cases were collected and analyzed three times, using an automatic biochemical analyzer, to detect serum MMP3 concentrations. Correlation was analyzed between MMP3 and other proinflammatory cytokines. Following normality tests, differences in serum MMP3 levels between the infected and noninfected group were analyzed via SPSS (version 25.0) software, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The MMP3 concentration was 44.44 (23.46 ~ 72.12) ng/mL in the infected group and 32.42 (28.16 ~ 41.21) ng/mL in the noninfected group.

A controlled human infection model (CHIM) would accelerate the efficacy assessment of candidate vaccines. This strategy would require deliberate exposure of volunteers to SARSCoV2 with no currently available treatment and a small but definite risk of serious illness or death. This raises complex questions about the social and ethical acceptability of risk to individuals, given the potential benefit to the wider population, and as such, a study cannot be done without public involvement. We conducted a structured public consultation with 57 individuals aged 20-40 years to understand public attitudes to a CHIM, and pre-requisites for enrolment. The overall response to this strategy was positive, and many would volunteer altruistically. Carefully controlled infection is viewed as safer than natural exposure to wild virus. The prolonged social isolation required for the proposed CHIM is considered an obstacle but not insurmountable, with reasonable compensation and supportive care. Given the significant level of public interest, a CHIM should be done as open science with regular, controlled dissemination of information into the public domain. Importantly, there was a strong view that the final decision whether to conduct a CHIM should be in the hands of qualified and experienced clinician-scientists and the authorities.","output":"Exploring the acceptability of controlled human infection with SARSCoV2-a public consultation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19-associated university closures moved classes online and interrupted ongoing research in universities throughout the US. In Vanderbilt University, first year biomedical sciences PhD students were in the middle of their spring semester coursework and in the process of identifying a thesis research lab, while senior students who had already completed the first year were at various stages of their graduate training and were working on their thesis research projects. To learn how the university closure and resulting interruptions impacted our students learning and well-being, we administered two surveys, one to the first year students and the other to the senior students. Our main findings show that the university closure negatively impacted the overall psychological health of about one-third of the survey respondents, time management was the aspect of remote learning that caused the highest stress for close to 50% of the students, and interaction with their peers and in-person discussions were the aspects of on-campus learning that students missed the most during the remote learning period. Additionally, survey responses also show that students experienced positive outcomes as a result of remote learning that included spending increased time on additional learning interests, with family, on self-care, and for dissertation or manuscript writing. Though a variety of supportive resources are already available to students in our institution, results from our survey suggest enhancing these measures and identifying new ones targeted to addressing the academic and emotional needs of PhD students would be beneficial.

OBJECTIVE: To review a selective for a course in diagnostic pathology geared toward undergraduate medical students, including its design, technical implementation, instructor and student evaluations, and suggestions for options for further adjusting and optimizing the selective. DESIGN: Whole slide images (WSI) were anonymized and students were given remote access to university computers, which were prepared with two freely available WSI viewers. Each topic was taught in a four-part module: Self-assigned reading, lecture via Zoom, quiz based on digital slide sets, and a frontal review of the slides via Zoom. Fifty-nine students participated in the selective. Following the course, students completed an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 59 participants, 42% (n = 25) responded. None of the respondents had any previous instruction in diagnostic pathology. Overall, the course was rated very favorably: 68% (n = 17) gave at least 3 points on a 4-point scale on questions relating to course interest, improvement in understanding of the covered diseases, and how strongly they would recommend a student take this course if given an option. The most significant disadvantage of the class, as reported by 80% (n = 20) were technical challenges in accessing the slides. CONCLUSION: We believe the course was a success and can be a model for future virtual pathology electives. Great effort should be done to provide technical support to the students.

To this end, an extended susceptible-exposed-infected-vaccinated-recovered (SEIVR) epidemic model is first established deterministically, considering the quarantine and vaccination effects, and then applied to the available COVID-19 data from US. Afterwards, the prediction results are described as a time-series of the number of people infected, recovered, and dead. Upon introducing the extended SEIVR model into a limit-state function and defining the model parameters including transmission, recovery, and mortality rates as random variables, the problem is transformed into a reliability model and analyzed by the Monte Carlo sampling. The findings are subsequently given in the form of exceedance probabilities (EPs) of the three main outputs, namely, the maximum number of infected cases, the total number of recovered cases, and the total number of fatal cases. Afterwards, by incorporating time into the formulation of the reliability problem, the EPs are calculated over time and presented as 3D probability graphs, illustrating the relationship between the number of cases affected (i.e., infected, recovered, or dead), exceedance probability, and time. The results for the US demonstrate that, by the end of 2021, the number of the infected (active) cases decreases to 0.8 million and number of cases recovered and fatalities increases to 41.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively.","output":"Time-variant reliability-based prediction of COVID-19 spread using extended SEIVR model and Monte Carlo sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) excretion in stools is well documented by RT-PCR, but evidences that stools contain infectious particles are scarce.

Among the RALH patients were cases of greater complexity: (1) higher prevalence of prior abdominopelvic surgery than that found among LAVH patients; (2) an increased number of procedures for endometriosis and pelvic reconstruction. Uterine weights also were greater in RALH patients [207.4 vs. 149.6 (LAVH; P < 0.001) and 141.1 g (LSH; P = 0.005)]. Despite case complexity, operative time was significantly lower in RALH than in LAVH (89.9 vs. 124.8 min, P < 0.001) and similar to that in LSH (89.6 min). Estimated blood loss was greater in LAVH (167.9 ml) than in RALH (59.0 ml, P < 0.001) or LSH (65.7 ml, P < 0.001). Length of hospital stay was shorter for RALH than for LAVH or LSH. Conversion and complication rates were low and similar across procedures. Multivariable regression indicated that LAVH, obesity, uterine weight 250 g and older age predicted significantly longer operative time. The learning curve for RALH demonstrated improved operative time over the case series. Our findings show the benefits of RALH over LAVH. Outcomes in RALH can be as good as or better than those in LSH, suggesting the latter should be the choice primarily for women desiring cervix-sparing surgery.","output":"Comparison of minimally invasive surgical approaches for hysterectomy at a community hospital: robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy, laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery trials were systematically reviewed.

Timing of an asthma event is extremely important and lack of identification of asthma increases the risk of death. A major challenge for health systems is the length of time between symptom onset and care seeking, which could result in delayed treatment initiation and worsening of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the utility of the internet search query data for the identification of the onset of asthma symptoms. METHODS: Pearson correlation coefficients between the time series of hospital admissions and Google searches were computed at lag times from 4 weeks before hospital admission to 4 weeks after hospital admission. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model with an autoregressive process at lags of 1 and 2 and Google searches at weeks C1 and C2 as exogenous variables were conducted to validate our correlation results. RESULTS: Google search volume for asthma had the highest correlation at 2 weeks before hospital admission. The ARIMAX model using an autoregressive process showed that the relative searches from Google about asthma were significant at lags 1 (P<.001) and 2 (P=.04).

The patients condition improved within a few days and the measures were no longer necessary. This measles case occurred in the pre-Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic when use of a Public Health Ordinance was considered an extreme measure.

Whereas general psychological symptoms (global symptom index, GSI) and percentage of responders above clinical cut-off for further psychological investigation were higher in the May sample compared to the October sample, schizotypy scores (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire) were higher in the October sample. We investigated potential associations, using general linear regression models (GLM). For schizotypy scores, we found that loneliness, use of drugs, and financial burden were more strongly corrected with schizotypy in the October compared to the May sample. We identified similar associations for GSI, as for schizotypy scores, in the May and October samples.

Thus, this review aims to systematically summarize and evaluate prior studies investigating the efficacy and safety of TTF in patients with high-grade gliomas. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines from database inception through February 2019. To be included, studies must have investigated the efficacy of TTF in adult high-grade glioma patients. RESULTS In total, 852 studies were initially identified, 9 of which met final inclusion criteria. In total, 1191 patients were identified who received TTF. Included studies consisted of two pilot clinical trials, two randomized clinical trials, and five retrospective studies.

Underpinned by the social model of disability and acceptance that universal design benefits the entire community, this study was conducted at a leading Australian university. A mixed methods approach was used to examine each of the three standard accommodations available: assignment extension, special consideration, and academic adjustment plans. Students living with disability were able to self-identify and to share their experiences relating to these procedures. As a result, data from 493 student survey responses and 9 subsequent follow-on interviews were analysed. At the same time, 10 disability support staff were asked about barriers and enablers faced by students. It was found that most students requiring assistance due to disability, identified as having a hidden disability (learning, cognition or psychiatric conditions). It was also found that accommodations most often related to assessment. While students were most satisfied with academic adjustment plans developed with the support staff, self-perceived notions of stigma associated with disability negatively impacted upon interactions with peers and teaching staff. This study contributes to an emerging body of literature which considers the potential impact universal design might have on the student experience. It is argued that findings are particularly relevant as educators re-imagine university learning and teaching for a post-COVID world.","output":"Academic accommodations for university students living with disability and the potential of universal design to address their needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Moderate and severe COVID-19 patients typically present with pneumonia.

Demographic and clinical data were obtained for each patient. Chest imaging was performed initially and after 3 weeks to detect post COVID pulmonary residuals. RESULTS: The study population included 74 (87.1%) moderate and 11 (12.9%) severe patients. Patients with older age, male gender, high BMI and initial chest CT of consolidation/mixed consolidation and ground glass opacities (GGOs) had more frequent post COVID-19 pulmonary residuals (P 0.003, 0.026, 0.031, 0.035) respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between patients who showed complete resolution and patients who developed pulmonary residuals regarding the lymphocyte count, serum CRP and ferritin levels (P 0.0001). After logistic regression, male gender, high BMI, initial chest CT of consolidation/mixed consolidation and GGOs, lymphocytopenia, high serum CRP and ferritin levels were the predictors of pulmonary residuals. While the age wasn't statistically significant. CONCLUSION: 38.5% of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients tend to have pulmonary residuals.

Since pandemic outbreaks are relatively infrequent, there is a dearth of evidence addressing the following questions: (i) Have the resources invested in strategic and routine communication for past pandemic outbreaks yielded public health preparedness benefits? (ii) Have past efforts sensitized people to pay attention to new pandemic threats? The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that was followed closely by major media outlets in the USA provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between exposure to public communication about epidemics and public awareness and knowledge about new risks. METHODS: In December, 2013, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 627 American adults and examined the associations between people's awareness to prior pandemics and their awareness of and knowledge about MERS. RESULTS: Awareness of prior pandemics was significantly associated with awareness and knowledge of MERS. The most common sources from which people first heard about MERS were also identified.

There have been studies of patients on in-center hemodialysis, but home dialysis population data are scarce. Our objective is to study the incidence and course of COVID-19 in a home dialysis unit (HDU) at the height of the pandemic. METHODS: An observational, retrospective study enrolling all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the HDU of Hospital Universitario La Paz (La Paz University Hospital) (Madrid, Spain) between March 10 and May 15, 2020. We collected clinical data from the HDU (57 patients on peritoneal dialysis and 22 patients on home hemodialysis) and compared the clinical characteristics and course of patients with and without COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Twelve patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (9 peritoneal dialysis; 3 home hemodialysis). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of clinical characteristics between patients with COVID-19 and the rest of the unit. The mean age was 6218.5 years; most were men (75%). All patients but one required hospitalization. Ten patients (83%) were discharged following a mean of 16.49.7 days of hospitalization. Two patients were diagnosed while hospitalized for other conditions, and these were the only patients who died. Those who died were older than those who survived. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 in our HDU in Madrid at the height of the pandemic was high, especially in patients on peritoneal dialysis. No potential benefit for preventing the infection in patients on home dialysis was observed. Advanced age and nosocomial transmission were the main factors linked to a worse prognosis.","output":"COVID-19 incidence and outcomes in a home dialysis unit in Madrid (Spain) at the height of the pandemic./ Incidencia y resultados de la COVID-19 en una unidad de dilisis domiciliaria en Madrid (Espa?a) durante el pico de la pandemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ectoparasite Varroa destructor is the greatest threat to managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies globally. Despite significant efforts, novel treatments to control the mite and its vectored pathogens have shown limited efficacy, as the host remains na?ve. A prospective solution lies in the development of Varroa-resistant honey bee stocks, but a paucity of rigorous selection data restricts widespread adoption. Here, we characterise the parasite and viral dynamics of a Varroa-resistant honey bee stock, designated 'Pol-line', using a large-scale longitudinal study. Results demonstrate markedly reduced Varroa levels in this stock, diminished titres of three major viruses (DWV-A, DWV-B, and CBPV), and a two-fold increase in survival. Levels of a fourth virus that is not associated with Varroa-BQCV-do not differ between stocks, supporting a disruption of the transmission pathway. Further, we show that when decoupled from the influence of Varroa levels, viral titres do not constitute strong independent predictors of colony mortality risk. These findings highlight the need for a reassessment of Varroa etiology, and suggest that derived stocks represent a tractable solution to the Varroa pandemic.","output":"A derived honey bee stock confers resistance to Varroa destructor and associated viral transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesTo determine whether COVID-19 efficacy varies with clinical risk category and to investigate risk factors for severe COVID-19 in those who have received two doses of vaccine.

Main outcome measureSevere COVID-19, defined as cases with entry to critical care or fatal outcome. ResultsEfficacy against severe COVID-19 of two doses of vaccine was 94% (95 percent CI 93% to 96%) in those without designated risk conditions, 89% (95 percent CI 86% to 91%) in those with moderate risk conditions, but only 73% (95 percent CI 64% to 79%) in those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and eligible for shielding. Of the 641 cases of severe COVID-19 in double-vaccinated individuals, 47% had moderate risk conditions and 38% were CEV. In the double-vaccinated CEV group, the rate ratio for severe disease (with no risk condition as reference category) was highest in solid organ transplants at 101 (95% CI 47 to 214) but even in this subgroup the absolute risk of severe COVID-19 was low (35 cases in 23678 person-months of follow-up). ConclusionsTwo doses of vaccine protect against severe COVID-19 in CEV individuals but the residual risk in double-vaccinated individuals remains far higher in those who are CEV than in those who are not.

RESULTS: Fifty-two clinic directors or their representatives completed the survey (83% response rate). About 2/3 of the clinics reported a greater than 50% decrease in the number of available patient appointments, and modified clinical surveillance and research protocols. Fifty-one clinics (98%) newly instituted telehealth during the pandemic. Barriers to telehealth prior to the pandemic were insurance reimbursement concerns and lack of infrastructure. Since telehealth was initiated, high provider satisfaction was reported with ease of use. The most common area of concern was related to inability to perform a physical examination.

METHODS Both the rotational and the multipinhole SPECT systems used the same model gamma-detectors. The 2 systems were applied in tandem to study 26 patients with documented coronary status. Visual image evaluation of the MPI together with quantitative analysis using circumferential profile curves (CPC) were used for interpretation of stress/rest myocardial flow differences. A dual-peak attenuation compensation (DPAC) technique was applied to the stress (201)Tl multipinhole SPECT images by weighted combination of the images from the upper and lower peaks. RESULTS Detection of myocardial infarction by location and extent correlated closely, and correlation of differential flow changes between stress and rest indicated similar accuracy in terms of location and extent of myocardial blood flow differences as well. In addition, the application of DPAC clarified the multipinhole stress (201)Tl images through reduced background and increased statistics and also improved the relative superposition of the normalized CPC, especially for the inferior and more basal reconstructed regions. CONCLUSION The prototype 3-detector multipinhole SPECT system achieved diagnostic results comparable to those for rotational SPECT and required only a single image-acquisition session to generate stress/rest MPI and 16-segment poststress gated studies. This reduction in acquisition time significantly improves productivity without compromising diagnostic accuracy. In addition, DPAC is a useful adjunct to the multipinhole SPECT modality because it improves both the visual clarity of the stress images and the stress/rest quantitative comparability.","output":"Comparison of simultaneous dual-isotope multipinhole SPECT with rotational SPECT in a group of patients with coronary artery disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Science may be failing to convince a significant number of people about COVID-19 scientific facts and needed public health measures.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the levels of D-dimer, total serum bilirubin (TSB), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), and CRP in diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection to COVID-19 patients without diabetes. Blood samples were collected from individuals with diabetes who had COVID-19 and non-diabetic COVID patients as control. Moreover, D-dimer and CRP were evaluated by using Min Vidus and Latx, respectively, whereas AccEnT 200 system was used to measure the serum level of TSB, GPT, and GOT in the hematology lab. Also demonstrated that the average serum concentration of D-dimer, GOT and CRP was high in diabetic COVID-19-infected patients (980.66 ng/mL, 67.71 U/L, and 27.06 mg/L, respectively) compared with non-diabetic COVID-19-infected patients (791.17 ng/mL, 54.023 U/L and 20.11 mg/L, respectively) (p < 0.05), while the situation was inverse for the average concentration of TSB and GTP when their average concentrations were low in diabetic COVID-19-infected patients (12.89 Mmol/L and 59.79 U/L, respectively) (p > 0.05).

Whilst challenges for knowledge and clinical skills are being actively addressed, wider considerations such as the impact on professional identity development have been mostly neglected thus far. A robust professional identity is linked to professional behaviour and has been shown to reduce burnout and be an important factor for general practice career choice amongst medical students. The Communities of Practice Model is a sociocultural approach that conceptualises the formation of professional identity through student engagement within a community. We argue the current suspension of clinical placements holds the potential to negatively influence such identity acquisition. In this commentary we explore how the Communities of Practice Model may inform professional identity development of medical students within the COVID-19 environment, considering digital communities and volunteering roles within primary care. We further encourage educators and institutions to consider professional identity in future planning to address the challenges posed by the current situation, both in terms of placement loss but also changes in the way primary care is delivered.

This is an important public health concern, and it has been largely attributed to the stigma attached to men who seek help. The present studies aim to understand the nature of such stigma. Specifically, are men who seek help for mental distress perceived to be less masculine and/or more feminine? Our findings suggest that symptomology, the diagnostic label, and targets' reaction to the symptoms jointly shape the gendered perceptions of help-seeking. In four experiments (N = 1118), participants read descriptions of targets with varying psychological or physical symptoms and provided masculinity and femininity ratings of the targets. People seeking help for internalizing symptoms (e.g., depressed moods) are perceived to be less masculine and more feminine than those seeking help for physical symptoms, yet the reverse pattern was found for people seeking help for externalizing symptoms (e.g., angry outbursts). In addition, the knowledge of a depression diagnosis decreased masculinity ratings and increased femininity ratings of male targets with physical symptoms (but not those with psychological symptoms), suggesting the power of labeling in shaping perceptions. Importantly, seeking help affects how men are perceived above and beyond symptomology: Men who downplay physical symptoms are perceived to be more masculine; whereas those who seek help for psychological symptoms are perceived to be more feminine. The association between help-seeking and masculinity ideologies shapes person perception, particularly because help-seeking violates norms of masculinity.

Local collaborations have been developed for decades. Yet little is known about the impact of cross-sector collaboration on health and health equity. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review of reviews to synthesize evidence on the health impacts of collaboration between local health care and non-health care organizations, and to understand the factors affecting how these partnerships functioned. We searched four databases and included 36 studies (reviews) in our review. We extracted data from these studies and used Nvivo 12 to help categorize the data. We assessed risk of bias in the studies using standardized tools. We used a narrative approach to synthesizing and reporting the data. RESULTS: The 36 studies we reviewed included evidence on varying forms of collaboration in diverse contexts. Some studies included data on collaborations with broad population health goals, such as preventing disease and reducing health inequalities. Others focused on collaborations with a narrower focus, such as better integration between health care and social services. Overall, there is little convincing evidence to suggest that collaboration between local health care and non-health care organizations improves health outcomes. Evidence of impact on health services is mixed. And evidence of impact on resource use and spending are limited and mixed. Despite this, many studies report on factors associated with better or worse collaboration. We grouped these into five domains: motivation and purpose, relationships and cultures, resources and capabilities, governance and leadership, and external factors. But data linking factors in these domains to collaboration outcomes is sparse. CONCLUSIONS: In theory, collaboration between local health care and non-health care organizations might contribute to better population health. But we know little about which kinds of collaborations work, for whom, and in what contexts. The benefits of collaboration may be hard to deliver, hard to measure, and overestimated by policymakers. Ultimately, local collaborations should be understood within their macro-level political and economic context, and as one component within a wider system of factors and interventions interacting to shape population health.

METHODS: We surveyed adult patients and parents of pediatric patients from rheumatology clinics in the Bronx, in the month following the epidemic peak regarding medication access, medication interruptions, COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and COVID-related distress. We examined which factors associated with patient-reported flares, disease activity, and overall health scores in regression models accounting for socio-demographics and rheumatologic disease type. RESULTS: Of 1,692 patients and parents contacted, 361 (21%) responded; 16% reported medication access difficulty, 14% medication interruptions, and 41% flare. In a multivariable logistic regression model, medication access difficulty was associated with increased odds of flare (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.5-10.4, p=0.005), as was high COVID-related distress (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6, p=0.01).

New antiviral medications against this disease have not been properly tested yet, and their efficiency, side effects, and drugCdrug interactions are not entirely known. Organ transplant recipients receive immunosuppressive medications such as tacrolimus to prevent graft rejection. Tacrolimus is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Many medications can either induce or inhibit this enzyme and affect the level. Awareness of possible drugCdrug interactions is vital because tacrolimus levels should be kept within a specific narrow range determined by the recipient's immunologic risk. Underexposure increases the risk of graft rejection, whereas overexposure may lead to adverse effects. Paxlovid, a novel antiviral medication approved for emergency use to treat SARS-CoV-2, is a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, a cytochrome P450 34A inhibitor. In this case report, we present a case of a kidney transplant patient receiving tacrolimus treated with Paxlovid, leading to an abruptly high tacrolimus level, significant symptoms, treatment interruption, and acute kidney injury. We conclude that the drugCdrug interaction between Paxlovid and tacrolimus is indeed robust and noteworthy and leads to high tacrolimus levels and its metabolites, adverse effects, and acute kidney injury. Physicians managing immunocompromised patients receiving tacrolimus should be aware of this significant drugCdrug interaction and consider other options or reduction of daily tacrolimus dose during treatment in addition to timely monitoring of both tacrolimus levels and serum creatinine.

The effectiveness of CP likely depends on its antiviral neutralizing potency and is determined using in vitro neutralizing antibody assays. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated abilities of three immunoassays for anti-spike antibodies (EUROimmun, Ortho, Roche), a pseudotype-based neutralization assay, and two assays that quantify ACE2 binding of spike protein (GenScript and hemagglutination test [HAT]-based assay) to predict neutralizing antibody titers in 113 CP donations. Assay outputs were analyzed through linear regression and calculation of sensitivities and specificities by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Median values of plasma samples containing neutralizing antibodies produced conversion factors for assay unitage of 6.5 (pseudotype), 19 (GenScript), 3.4 (HAT assay), 0.08 (EUROimmun), 1.64 (Roche), and 0.10 (Ortho). All selected assays were sufficient in identifying the high titer donations based on ROC analysis; area over curve ranged from 91.7% for HAT and GenScript assay to 95.6% for pseudotype assay. However, their ability to predict the actual neutralizing antibody levels varied substantially as shown by linear regression correlation values (from 0.27 for Ortho to 0.61 for pseudotype assay). DISCUSSION: Overall, the study data demonstrate that all selected assays were effective in identifying donations with high neutralizing antibody levels and are potentially suitable as surrogate assays for donation selection for CP therapy.","output":"Comparability of six different immunoassays measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with neutralizing antibody levels in convalescent plasma: From utility to prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was aimed at providing practical information to improve Korean adolescents wellness by empirically identifying its correlation with sports participation and having an internal health locus of control (IHLC) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Growth kinetics showed peak titers of 105.5 plaque-forming units ml?1 15 h after infection. Filtration experiments and electron microscopy revealed a particle diameter between 100 and 200 nm. The bouyant density of the virus was 1.18. The particle lost its infectivity on treatment with lipid solvents. Virus replication could not be inhibited by 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine. PEDV was moderately stable at 50C, but heat sensitivity was not altered by divalent cations. At 4C, the virus was stable between pH 5.0 and 9.0, but at 37C stability was restricted to the pH range 6.5C7.5. Viral infectivity was not impaired by ultrasonication or by multiple freezing and thawing. PEDV was not neutralized by transmissible gastroenteritis virus antiserum. On the basis of the tests carried out, PEDV is a pleomorphic, enveloped RNA virus with a particle diameter of  150 nm and a bouyant density of 1.18. Infectivity depends on the presence of trypsin, and infected cells show a tendency to fuse and to form syncytia.

METHODS Thirty-two patients with familial Mediterranean fever and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. All the patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurement. The AngioVue optical coherence tomography angiography device (Optovue, Fremont, CA) with split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography was used to evaluate and examine the retinal microvascular structure. Three-dimensional en face Optical coherence tomography angiography images were obtained by examining the macula using the 3 x 3 mm scanning protocol in the Angio Retina mode and the optic nerve using the 3 x 3 mm scanning protocol in the Angio Disk mode. All the patients' right eyes were examined. RESULTS A total of 62 subjects were included in the study, of whom 32 (53.3%) were female and 30 (46.7%) were male. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of optic nerve head or radial peripapillary capillary vessel density. On examination, the superficial capillary plexuses were statistically similar between the two groups, but the deep capillary plexus vessel density in the parafovea, superior hemi, temporal, and superior areas were significantly lower in the patients with familial Mediterranean fever. CONCLUSIONS We found that the capillary plexus vessel density was significantly lower in the parafovea, superior hemi, temporal, and superior regions in the patients with familial Mediterranean fever than in the control group.

Each task involves performing a series of scrolling or swiping gestures, from which behavioral information such as movement speed or pressure is extracted. The completion of the daily tasks did not require extra interaction with the Mechanical Turk platform, yet paid workers through it. This differs somewhat from the typical rapid completion of one-off tasks that workers are used to on Amazon Mechanical Turk. This atypical use of the platform prompted us to evaluate aspects related to long-term worker retention and engagement over the study period, in particular the impacts of payment schedule (amount and structure over time) and reminder notifications.

This paper implements a contact tracing-based stochastic compartment model as a baseline, to further modify the existing setup to include the spatial risk. This modification of each individual-level contact's intensity to be dependent on its spatial location has been termed as Contextual Contact Tracing. The results highlight that the inclusion of spatial context tends to send more individuals into quarantine which reduces the overall spread of infection.

All 3 that screen all patients do not use contrast if the patient has an eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) of 30-59 ml/min, 1 considers other modality; and if the patient has an eGFR of <30 ml/min, 2 do not use contrast but consider other modality, however 1 continues with the high risk agent. CONCLUSION Gadodiamide is widely used, with varied practice in screening for renal function, and risk factors associated with NSF. Current evidence shows that it is advisable to administer macrocyclic agents in patients with compromised renal function. It is also imperative to establish local guidelines in line with international guidelines in order to minimize the incidence of NSF.","output":"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: A survey of the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in Ghana."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus that has spread rapidly around the world, leading to high mortality because of multiple organ dysfunction; however, its underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. To determine the molecular mechanism of multiple organ dysfunction, a bioinformatics analysis method based on a time-order gene co-expression network (TO-GCN) was performed. First, gene expression profiles were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database (GSE161200), and a TO-GCN was constructed using the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to infer the pattern of changes in the different organs over time. Second, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was used to analyze the main biological processes related to COVID-19. The initial gene modules for the immune response of different organs were defined as the research object. The STRING database was used to construct a proteinCprotein interaction network of immune genes in different organs. The PageRank algorithm was used to identify five hub genes in each organ. Finally, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database played an important role in exploring the potential compounds that target the hub genes. The results showed that there were two types of biological processes: the bodys stress response and cell-mediated immune response involving the lung, trachea, and olfactory bulb (olf) after being infected by COVID-19. However, a unique biological process related to the stress response is the regulation of neuronal signals in the brain. The stress response was heterogeneous among different organs. In the lung, the regulation of DNA morphology, angiogenesis, and mitochondrial-related energy metabolism are specific biological processes related to the stress response. In particular, an effect on tracheal stress response was made by the regulation of protein metabolism and rRNA metabolism-related biological processes, as biological processes. In the olf, the distinctive stress responses consist of neural signal transmission and brain behavior. In addition, myeloid leukocyte activation and myeloid leukocyte-mediated immunity in response to COVID-19 can lead to a cytokine storm. Immune genes such as SRC, RHOA, CD40LG, CSF1, TNFRSF1A, FCER1G, ICAM1, LAT, LCN2, PLAU, CXCL10, ICAM1, CD40, IRF7, and B2M were predicted to be the hub genes in the cytokine storm. Furthermore, we inferred that resveratrol, acetaminophen, dexamethasone, estradiol, statins, curcumin, and other compounds are potential target drugs in the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"The Molecular Mechanism of Multiple Organ Dysfunction and Targeted Intervention of COVID-19 Based on Time-Order Transcriptomic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 epidemic expands in the world, and with the previous SARS epidemic, avian flu, Ebola and AIDS serving as a warning, biomedical and biotechnological research has the task to find solutions to counteract viral entry and pathogenesis A novel approach can come from marine chemodiversity, recognized as a relevant source for developing a future natural \\"antiviral pharmacy\\" Activities of antioxidants against viruses can be exploited to cope with human viral infection, from single individual infections to protection of populations There is a potentially rich and fruitful reservoir of such compounds thanks to the plethora of bioactive molecules and families present in marine microorganisms The aim of this communication is to present the state-of-play of what is known on the antiviral activities recognized in (micro)algae, highlighting the different molecules from various algae and their mechanisms of actions, when known Given the ability of various algal molecules-mainly sulfated polysaccharides-to inhibit viral infection at Stage I (adsorption and invasion of cells), we envisage a need to further investigate the antiviral ability of algae, and their mechanisms of action Given the advantages of microalgal production compared to other organisms, the opportunity might become reality in a short period of time","output":"Marine Algal Antioxidants as Potential Vectors for Controlling Viral Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The association of invasive fungal infections (IFI) and viral infections has been described in patients with hematologic malignancies (HM), in particular in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of summary statistics from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Data were publicly available and de-identified, and individuals were not involved. MEASUREMENT AND METHODS: We extracted the age-standardised and age-specific incidence/mortality rates, and risk factors attributed to COPD in China and high SDI countries from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. We first described differences in COPD patterns (ie, incidence and mortality rates) in China and high SDI countries briefly, and then explored possible reasons for driving such differences by comparing rankings for six well-established COPD risk factors and estimating change points in age-specific incidence and mortality rates for COPD and several commonly encountered competing risks using segmented regression models. RESULTS: Differences in age-standardised incidence and mortality rates for COPD between China and high SDI countries converged during 1990C2017 but still differed, particularly for mortality rates. Smoking was the leading attributable risk factor followed by ambient air pollution, with higher rankings for occupational risks in China than in high SDI countries. The change point was ~80 years for age-specific COPD mortality rate in both China and high SDI countries. However, the change point for COPD incidence was 5-year later in China (~65 years) than in high SDI countries (~60 years). The change points for mortality rates due to competing risks (eg, ischaemic heart disease) also varied between settings. CONCLUSION: Differences in risk factors largely shaped the differences in COPD patterns between China and high SDI countries. Varying patterns of mortality due to competing risks might also contribute to the discrepancy in COPD mortality rates, by affecting the survival of the underlying population.","output":"Do deaths from competing risks influence COPD patterns in China and high socio-demographic index countries?: a cross-sectional analysis of summary statistics from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resistance to the last-line antibiotics against invasive Gram-negative bacterial infection is a rising concern in public health. Multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii Aci46 can resist colistin and carbapenems with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 512 g/mL as determined by microdilution method and shows no zone of inhibition by disk diffusion method. These phenotypic characteristics prompted us to further investigate the genotypic characteristics of Aci46. Next generation sequencing was applied in this study to obtain whole genome data. We determined that Aci46 belongs to Pasture ST2 and is phylogenetically clustered with international clone (IC) II as the predominant strain in Thailand. Interestingly, Aci46 is identical to Oxford ST1962 that previously has never been isolated in Thailand. Two plasmids were identified (pAci46a and pAci46b), neither of which harbors any antibiotic resistance genes but pAci46a carries a conjugational system (type 4 secretion system or T4SS). Comparative genomics with other polymyxin and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains (AC30 and R14) identified shared features such as CzcCBA, encoding a cobalt/zinc/cadmium efflux RND transporter, as well as a drug transporter with a possible role in colistin and/or carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses against MDR ACICU strain showed three novel mutations i.e., Glu229Asp, Pro200Leu, and Ala138Thr, in the polymyxin resistance component, PmrB.

This study focuses on these obstacles while considering the different activities (or subprocesses) embedded in this phase and the different actors involved in this complex process. We conducted a longitudinal case study in real time to investigate the implementation of MI internally generated by a multinational industrial company. Our results show that the obstacles encountered during the MI implementation phase may differ depending on the different activities and actors of this phase, thus leading us to question current implementation frameworks.

For an outbreak with reproductive numbers R between 1.1 and 2, our results suggest that the intervention effect of weekly pooled testing of the 10% largest households in an urban area is on par with the effect of imposing strict lockdown measures. By testing no more than 20% of households every 4 days, the model predicts that one can reduce R from 1.6 to below unity over a few weeks, lowering the prevalence by 75%.

Much less attention is paid to the longer-term consequences for individuals and populations in terms of the sequelae of infections, such as blindness after smallpox, deafness due to congenital rubella, and paralysis after polio. This same tendency is observed in the COVID-19 pandemic, with counts of cases and deaths, questions of immunity, and economic impacts at the foreground and long-term or chronic health impairment of COVID-19 survivors receiving less attention. Much of the existing research on the effects of such disease sequelae has come from disability history;in addition, the bioarchaeology of impairment/disability is an emerging area of research that can contribute insight into experiences of disease consequences. In this article, we give an overview of published work on survivors of infectious disease using both bioarchaeology and disability history. Using the example of post-polio paralysis, we propose a theoretical approach to the bioarchaeological study of infectious disease that is inclusive of the history of impairment and disability, which we refer to as a survivor lens. We structure this discussion through scaffolded questions that move through multiple levels of analysis: from the individual and relational to the drivers of cultural change. We argue that bioarchaeological research on past epidemics and pandemics that attends to morbidity and lasting impairment and disability can contribute to wider conversations about infectious disease and disability in the past and present.

The impacts of virtual learning on students performance during the COVID-19 pandemic were investigated in this study as well. For collecting the data, a semi-structured interview was employed. After collecting the data, the data was transcribed verbatim and four major themes were constructed: (1) students perceptions of learning practices before the outbreak of COVID-19, 2) the impact of distance learning modality during the COVID-19 pandemic and its challenges on students learning, 3) students learning anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic, and 4) level of students satisfaction from face-to-face learning system after a decrease in the cases of COVID-19. The findings showed that students learning process across the higher education institutions of Afghanistan have been worst affected due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The results also revealed that virtual learning modality during the COVID-19 caused more anxiety in students learning practices and it led to more isolation in their learning process.

METHODS A sub-analysis of a prospective, multicenter non-representative cohort study conducted in 162 ICUs in 24 countries. RESULTS Of the 1156 patients with hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) included in the EUROBACT study, 96 patients had a HAF. Median time to its diagnosis was 20 days (IQR 10.5-30.5) and 9 days (IQR 3-15.5) after hospital and ICU admission, respectively. Median time to positivity of blood culture was longer in fungemia than in bacteremia (48.7 h vs. 38.1 h; p = 0.0004). Candida albicans was the most frequent fungus isolated (57.1%), followed by Candida glabrata (15.3%) and Candida parapsilosis (10.2%). No clear source of HAF was detected in 33.3% of the episodes and it was catheter-related in 21.9% of them. Compared to patients with bacteremia, HAF patients had a higher rate of septic shock (39.6% vs. 21.6%; p = 0.0003) and renal dysfunction (25% vs. 12.4%; p = 0.0023) on admission and a higher rate of renal failure (26% vs. 16.2%; p = 0.0273) at diagnosis. Adequate treatment started within 24 h after blood culture collection was less frequent in HAF patients (22.9% vs. 55.3%; p < 0.001). The 28-day all cause fatality was 40.6%. According to multivariate analysis, only liver failure (OR 14.35; 95% CI 1.17-175.6; p = 0.037), need for mechanical ventilation (OR 8.86; 95% CI 1.2-65.24; p = 0.032) and ICU admission for medical reason (OR 3.87; 95% CI 1.25-11.99; p = 0.020) were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in HAF patients. CONCLUSIONS Fungi are an important cause of hospital-acquired BSI in the ICU. Patients with HAF present more frequently with septic shock and renal dysfunction on ICU admission and have a higher rate of renal failure at diagnosis. HAF are associated with a significant 28-day mortality rate (40%), but delayed adequate antifungal therapy was not an independent risk factor for death. Liver failure, need for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission for medical reason were the only independent predictors of 28-day mortality.","output":"Characteristics and risk factors for 28-day mortality of hospital acquired fungemias in ICUs: data from the EUROBACT study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Senecavirus A (SVA) is a member of the genus Senecavirus of the family Picornaviridae.

Characteristic symptoms include vesicular lesions on the snout and feet as well as lameness in adult pigs and even death in piglets. The capsid protein VP3, a structural protein of SVA, is involved in viral replication and genome packaging. Here, we developed and characterized a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3E9 against VP3. A motif (192)GWFSLHKLTK(201) was identified as the linear B-cell epitope recognized by mAb 3E9 by using a panel of GFP-tagged epitope polypeptides. Sequence alignments show that (192)GWFSLHKLTK(201) was highly conserved in all SVA strains. Subsequently, alanine (A)-scanning mutagenesis indicated that W193, F194, L196, and H197 were the critical residues recognized by mAb 3E9. Further investigation with indirect immunofluorescence assay indicated that the VP3 protein was present in the cytoplasm during SVA replication. In addition, the mAb 3E9 specifically immunoprecipitated the VP3 protein from SVA-infected cells.

This study aimed to validate two serologic tests for total (IgM, IgG, IgA) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, (i) the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody assay for the Vitros 5600 analyzers and (ii) a manual laboratory developed ELISA (FDA EUA pending), for use in parallel orthogonal testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers and affiliates of the University of Maryland Medical System. DESIGN AND METHODS: Validation and verification of the two tests was performed using samples from hospitalized patients that were found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, samples pre-COVID-19, and samples from individuals with current/previous infections with other viruses. Healthcare workers and affiliates from across the University of Maryland Health System were provided testing free of charge and their results were reported as reactive or non-reactive if the two tests were concordance, or indeterminate if the results were discordant. RESULTS: Validation testing found the Ortho Vitros test to be 100% (73/73) sensitive, and 99.3% (152/153) specific, while the UMMC ELISA was found to be 97.6% (204/209) sensitive and 100% (288/288) specific. Real world testing among 8399 healthcare workers found that 2.9% (247/8399) of healthcare workers were positive for anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by both tests. An indeterminate rate of 1.1% (91/8399), in which one test reported reactive results, and one as non-reactive was also seen. CONCLUSIONS: Parallel orthogonal testing improves the positive and negative predictive value of serologic testing in populations with low prevalence.

The inclusion criteria were that the paper provided evidence on the impact of lockdown and related measures, focused on LLMICs, addressed impacts on women and child's health, addressed epidemics from 2000-2020, was peer-reviewed, provided original evidence, and was published in English. The Joanne Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tools were used to assess the quality of the studies, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting. The evidence from the papers was grouped by type of lockdown measure and categories of impact, using a narrative data-based convergent synthesis design. RESULTS The review process identified 46 papers meeting the inclusion criteria from 17 countries that focussed on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Ebola epidemics. The evidence on the decrease of utilisation of health services showed plummeting immunisation rates and faltering use of maternal and perinatal services, which was linked to a growth of premature deaths. Impacts on the mental health of children and women were convincingly established, with lockdowns associated with surges in depression, anxiety and low life satisfaction. Vulnerability may be compounded by lockdowns, as livelihoods were disrupted, and poverty levels increased. CONCLUSION Limitations included that searches were conducted in late-2020 as new research was being published, and that some evidence not published in English may have been excluded.

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression levels, microsatellite instability, and tumor mutation burden may assist in predicting the anti-tumor efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. However, their clinical application value is limited, and there is currently a dearth of specific clinical markers to monitor or predict the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

Therefore, this review aimed to introduce and discuss the latest research on the correlation between the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and irAEs.

Methods: A 3-month prospective study of patients 65 years of age and above in three medicine wards: in two wards patients were examined by trained study team members using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), while the third was a control ward where CAM was not administered. The third ward served to control for the effect of the presence of investigators in the other wards as a potential confounding factor. Based on the results of this assessment patients were defined as suffering from subsyndromal delirium, full delirium (these two groups were later combined into an any symptoms of delirium group), and no delirium. The rate of diagnosis by the medical team was obtained from the electronic medical records. Results: The full delirium rate was 5.1%, the rate of subsyndromal delirium was 14.6%, and the rate of any symptoms of delirium was 19.6%. Absence of a partner, pain, anemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and the use of drugs with an anticholinergic burden were factors for any symptoms of delirium as well as for subsyndromal delirium. Subsyndromal delirium and any symptoms of delirium were associated with a reduced chance of being discharged to home and a higher 3-month mortality rate.

Methods After permission from institutional review board, 60 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were divided into two groups, smokers and non-smokers (30 each). Along with baseline haemo-dynamic parameters, arterial blood gas sampling was done to assess and compare PCO2, pH and bicarbonate (HCO3) values at various time intervals with respect to pneumo-peritoneum creation, between smokers and non smokers. Results Baseline systolic blood pressure was higher and oxygen saturation was significantly lower in smoker group. PCO2 and end-tidal CO2 were significantly higher in smokers at all intervals (P < 0.001). pH was significantly lower and HCO3 higher, in smokers after creation of pneumo-peritoneum. Increase in PCO2 due to pneumo-peritoneum was higher in the smoker group (3.49  8.5) mmHg versus non smoker (0.56  4.86) mmHg, although statistically not significant.

The uncorrected visual acuity was 20/400 in both eyes and the best corrected visual acuity was determined to be 20/25 in the right eye with -5.50 spherical refractive correction and 20/20 in the left eye with -6.25 spherical refractive correction. On the second day of examination, diplopia developed. The patient's clinical condition was considered to be related to the drug and topiramate was discontinued immediately. The clinical findings of the patient subsequently improved rapidly without treatment. On the fifth day of examination, her autorefractometry measurements were +0.25 -0.25  121 in her right eye and +0.25 in her left eye and her uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes with normal bilateral anterior chamber depth. She had no vision complaint or diplopia but she began to experience photosensitivity, which persisted for 4 months before regressing completely. When ophthalmologists encounter acute myopia and acute-onset ACG, especially in young patients, they should keep the use of topiramate in mind.","output":"Topiramate-Induced Acute Myopia, Diplopia, and Photosensitivity: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is high, but breakthrough infections still occur. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 67 breakthrough cases after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), or JNJ-78436735 (Janssen) to unvaccinated controls (February-April 2021) in metropolitan New York, including their phylogenetic relationship, distribution of variants, and full spike mutation profiles. Their median age was 45 years; seven required hospitalization and one died. Most breakthrough infections (54/67) occurred with B.1.1.7 (Alpha) or B.1.526 (Iota). Among the 7 hospitalized cases, 5 were infected with B.1.1.7, including 1 death. Both unmatched and matched statistical analyses considering age, sex, vaccine type, and study month as covariates supported the null hypothesis of equal variant distributions between vaccinated and unvaccinated in chi-squared and McNemar tests (p>0.1) highlighting a high vaccine efficacy against B.1.1.7 and B.1.526. There was no clear association among breakthroughs between type of vaccine received and variant. In the vaccinated group, spike mutations in the N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain that have been associated with immune evasion were overrepresented. The evolving dynamic of SARS-Co-V2 variants requires broad genomic analyses of breakthrough infections to provide real-life information on immune escape mediated by circulating variants and their spike mutations.","output":"Dominance of Alpha and Iota variants in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) has been shown to improve motor performance in people with and without disabilities. Previous investigations on the use of nGVS to improve upper-limb motor performance have focused on unimanual fine motor movements, nevertheless, bimanual gross movements are also essential for conducting activities of daily living and can be affected as a result of cerebral dysfunction. Consequently, in this study we investigated the effects of nGVS on bimanual gross motor performance. Methods Twelve healthy participants completed a visuomotor task in which they performed bimanual upper-limb movements using two robots. During the task, participants tracked a target that oscillated following a sinusoidal amplitude-modulated trajectory. In half of the trials, participants received subthreshold nGVS, in the other half, they received sham stimulation. Primary outcome measure: percent improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) between the target's and cursors' trajectories. Secondary outcome measures: percent improvement in lag between the cursors and target; and percent improvement in RMSE between the cursors' trajectories. A post-test questionnaire was administered to evaluate the experience of participants. Results Tracking error was not affected by nGVS: left -2.6(5.5)%, p = 0.128; right -0.9(6.2)%, p = 0.639; nor was bimanual coordination -1.5(9.6)%, p = 0.590. When comparing if one hand was affected more than the other, we did not find a statistically significant difference (-1.7(3.3)%, p = 0.098). Similar results were found for the lag. Questionnaire results indicated that the robotic devices did not limit participants' movements, did not make participants feel unsafe, nor were they difficult to control. Furthermore, participants did not feel unsafe with the nGVS device, nor did they report any discomfort due to nGVS. Conclusion Results suggest that nGVS applied to people without disabilities do not affect bimanual gross motor performance. However, as this was the first study to investigate such effects, stimulation parameters were based on previous unimanual fine motor studies. Future studies should investigate optimal stimulation parameters for improving upper-limb gross motor performance. Overall, participants felt safe using the robotic devices and receiving the noisy electrical stimulation. As such, a similar setup could potentially be employed for subsequent studies investigating the relation between upper-limb performance and nGVS.","output":"Effects of Noisy Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation During a Bimanual Tracking Robotic Task."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and","output":"Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)-A Systemic Review and Comparison of Clinical Presentation and Symptomatology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aims to propose a framework of transformative strategies across the different levels of the service ecosystem for the recovery, well-being and inclusion of Latin American small service firms in the new service marketplace.

Main outcomes were loss of quality-adjusted life days (QALDs); physical symptoms; and COVID-19-related private expenditures. We analysed results using multivariable regressions with post-hoc weighting by age and sex, and conditional logistic regressions for the association of each symptom and EQ-5D limitation on cases and controls. Results: Of 548 cases (mean age 41.1 years; 61.5% female), 16.8% reported physical symptoms at month 6 (most frequently extreme tiredness, headache, loss of taste and/or smell, and shortness of breath). Cases reported more limitations with doing usual activities than controls. Almost half of cases spent a mean of GBP18.1 on non-prescription drugs (median: GBP10.0), and 52.7% missed work or school for a mean of 12 days (median: 10).

Complete genomic analysis revealed that the P. alcaligenes isolate KAM426 co-harbors tmexC3D2-toprJ3 consisting of tmexC3, tmexD2, and toprJ3, along with two copies of the carbapenemase gene blaIMP-1 on the chromosome. tmexC3D2-toprJ3 in KAM426 was flanked by the IS5/IS1182 family transposase gene, suggesting that the gene cluster was acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Comparative genomic analysis using the public genome database showed that tmexC3D2-toprJ3 has spread to other Pseudomonas species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa via HGT mediated by mobile gene elements such as a plasmid.

Even before the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, youth included screens in many aspects of growth and development, including academic achievement, family and social connections, and identity exploration. Thus, it has become increasingly challenging to keep a teenagers actions on digital media outside of the school perimeter, especially when these actions may appear malicious or threatening in nature. This presentation will: 1) help child and adolescent psychiatrists review the most common digital mediaCrelated incidents that might precipitate a school threat assessment;and 2) provide guidance to parents and school officials regarding how to approach these digital mediaCrelated threats and navigate the students continued use of these media. Methods: This presentation will review common ways in which safety concerns might arise from student behaviors on digital media. Using case examples, we will help participants to evaluate digital mediaCbased threats differently from those made directly in person. Finally, we will guide participants through drafting media plans for students who engage in online threatening behaviors. Results: Schools may cite numerous safety concerns regarding a students online behavior including cyberbullying, involvement in extremist forums/fringe groups, or even gaming. While the substantive nature of all potential threats must be determined, digital media in particular may facilitate a teenagers participation in online aggression through a lack of face-to-face accountability and group-think. After a threat is made, the initial inclination may be to recommend removal of a teenagers access to digital media;however, this decision is not without ramifications, and as such, we recommend the use of concrete media planning. Conclusions: Digital media will remain a constant in adolescents lives, and therefore, threatening behavior will continue to make its way into the school from cyberspace. For this reason, it is imperative that child and adolescent psychiatrists who interface with schools have awareness of how the virtual world can influence aggressive behavior and how to help schools respond to digital threats.

There is no treatment method proven effective in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics. The whole world is still working on it. Convalescent Plasma (CP) treatment is a passive antibody treatment that has been shown to be effective during periods of epidemic disease in history. CP treatment is interesting in the treatment of virus infection without vaccine or specific treatment, such as SARSCoV-2, which causes COVID-19. The mechanisms of action of CP include neutralizing the virus by direct binding, initiating virus elimination by complement activation, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and / or phagocytosis. Neutralizing antibodies are the most important mechanisms of action. The most important point in recovery is the inactivation of the virus and the prevention of viral replication. It was demonstrated for the first time that CP significantly reduced mortality in COVID-19 disease. Our results of CP treatment in COVID-19 patients have been published. We have shown that CP is effective and safe in COVID-19 disease. We aimed to gather CP experiences up to date in COVID-19.

ARDS associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 infection has been shown to have 45% mortality, secondary to elevated inflammatory cytokines2. Prolonged duration of ECMO leads to poor short term neurological function 3. However there is lack of data regarding long term quality of life among patients who undergo ECMO for ARDS. We plan to conduct a retrospective study among patients undergoing ECMO to assess their quality of life. Methods: Retrospectives chart review and phone interviews conducted approximately 6 months after receiving ECMO at New York University-Long Island Hospital. 22 patients have received veno-venous or veno-arterial ECMO since March 2020. Phone interviews of 10 patients have been conducted. Welch two sample t test will be used to detect differences between activities of daily living (ADL) between prolonged ECMO (more than 20 days) and routine ECMO (less than 20 days) groups. Association between ECMO parameters, laboratory values and ADL will be evaluated by using a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Result will be considered statistically significant if p&lt;0.05 Results:11 out of 22 patients have been discharged from hospital, 1 patient continues to receive ECMO. Initial analysis of our data shows that patients undergoing prolonged ECMO have a low mean score of 14 for activities of daily living (bathing, independent use of toilet, cooking and eating meals, shopping, driving, and use of supplemental oxygen) when compared to a mean score of 30 among routine ECMO. Mean Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and D Dimer levels 24 hours prior to undergoing cannulation for ECMO among prolonged ECMO group was higher when compared to routine ECMO group.

Autoimmune aPLs are pathogenic as patients are at increased risk of enhancing thrombin generation at a young age. There are only three aPLs considered as diagnostic laboratory markers for APS - IgM, IgG, and IgA isotypes. However, the association of the IgA isotypes with clinical thrombosis remains highly controversial. A 30-year-old male with a past medical history of childhood asthma initially presented to the hospital with acute left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke, which did not get resolved with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) but was successfully resolved with thromboembolectomy. It was speculated to be associated with a clot from mitral valve prolapse found subsequently on echocardiogram. Twenty-eight days later, the patient presented again with a high-grade luminal narrowing of his mid- and distal left internal carotid artery with 80% narrowing and an acute dissection of his left internal carotid artery. The recurrence of thrombosis was evaluated through hypercoagulable state workup, which demonstrated evidence of antiphospholipid syndrome with elevated beta-2 glycoprotein IgA antibody titers of more than 150 U/mL. This is one of the first cases reported nationwide as evidence of thrombogenesis recurrence induced by IgA antiphospholipid antibody (2) glycoprotein I-dependent in early adulthood. IgA anti- (2)GPI antibodies are found to have an association with many clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome and thrombotic events, particularly arterial thrombosis. To determine the link between the IgA-a(2)GPI antibodies and APS-events in asymptomatic individuals before recommending preventive treatments, there needs to be a broader intention to standardize IgA-a(2)GPI assays as a diagnostic criterion for APS.","output":"Evidence of Thrombogenesis Recurrence Induced by IgA Antiphospholipid Antibody 2 Glycoprotein I-Dependent in Early Adulthood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the provision of mental health care services and the ability to provide neuropsychological evaluations.

The study aimed to develop a novel predictor called cumulative oxygen deficit (COD) for the risk stratification. METHODS: The study was conducted in four designated hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients in Jingmen, Wuhan, from January to March 2020. COD was defined to account for both the magnitude and duration of hypoxemia. A higher value of COD indicated more oxygen deficit. The predictive performance of COD was calculated in multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: A number of 111 patients including 80 in the non-IMV group and 31 in the IMV group were included. Patients with IMV had substantially lower PaO(2) (62 (49, 89) vs. 90.5 (68, 125.25) mmHg; p < 0.001), and higher COD (?6.87 (?29.36, 52.38) vs. ?231.68 (?1040.78, 119.83) mmHgday) than patients without IMV. As compared to patients with COD < 0, patients with COD > 30 mmHgday had higher risk of fatality (HR: 3.79, 95% CI [2.57C16.93]; p = 0.037), and those with COD > 50 mmHgday were 10 times more likely to die (HR: 10.45, 95% CI [1.28C85.37]; p = 0.029).

Estimates of the proportion of populations who wash their hands have indicated limited compliance. While biases of self-report items for hand hygiene, such as the tendency to overestimate one's behaviour, represent a limitation, direct survey questions remain important. This study aims to compare indices of handwashing compliance based on single vs. combined handwashing attributes, i.e., its frequency, technique, and duration. METHODS: Data of a representative survey on hygiene and infection control by the German Federal Centre for Health Education were analysed. In a cross-sectional, computer-assisted telephone interview design, the resident population in Germany aged 16-85 years was surveyed in 2012. For handwashing, duration, frequency in different situations, and technique (use of soap, washing interdigital spaces, and drying hands) were self-reported. Self-reports were rated as (non-)compliant based on national recommendations and combined into single- and multi-attribute indices. Use of hand disinfectants, recall of handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms, and socio-demographics were also assessed. In total, N = 4483 persons participated (response rate: 49.7%). Data were weighted to compensate for sampling bias and analysed by cross-tabulation and multiple logistic regression. Primarily due to missing data, the analysis was confined to N = 4093 respondents (i.e., 91%). RESULTS: Among women, the proportion of those who reported to wash hands \\"almost always\\" in at least seven of nine situations was 30.8% (men: 20.3%). In contrast, 51% of men reported always using soap, drying hands, and washing interdigital spaces (women: 43.5%; p < 0.001). Compliance based on indices that included \\"frequency\\" was higher in women by 5.2% for \\"frequency + technique\\" (17.6% vs. 12.4%), and 2.5% for \\"frequency + duration\\" (13.1% vs. 10.6%) and \\"frequency + duration + technique\\" (8.8% vs. 6.3%; p < 0.02). Socio-demographic differences were most consistent regarding higher compliance among healthcare workers. Finally, especially men recalling handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms had higher compliance than those with no recall, namely, for \\"frequency + technique\\" (15.4% vs. 10.6%; OR: 1.9), all three attributes (7.6% vs. 5.3%; OR = 1.7), and \\"technique\\" (56.9% vs. 47.7%; OR = 1.6). The highest odds ratio was noted for disinfectant use among men (OR = 2.5; 12.2% vs. 4.9%). DISCUSSION: While being representative for Germany, limitations include the survey's cross-sectionality, response rate, and the study representing the situation in 2012. Nonetheless, indices based on combined attributes allow better comparison to scarce compliance estimates for Germany based on observation. Socio-demographic differences add to existing evidence, e.g., higher compliance by healthcare workers. Finally, although reverse causation is possible, it is notable that although handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms focus on duration and technique, women recalling them reported higher frequency, and men more often report hand disinfectant use, suggesting possible carry-over effects. CONCLUSION: Self-reported handwashing compliance assessment may be improved by partitioning the behavioural domain into different attributes and using indices based on combinations of these.","output":"When, how, and how long do adults in Germany self-reportedly wash their hands?

In the current study, a comparative transcriptome analysis of two N. perurans isolates of contrasting virulence phenotypes is presented using gill-associated, virulent (wild type) isolates, and in vitro cultured, avirulent (clonal) isolates. Differential gene expression analysis identified a total of 21,198 differentially expressed genes between the wild type and clonal isolates, with 5674 of these genes upregulated in wild type N. perurans. Gene set enrichment analysis predicted gene sets enriched in the wild type isolates including, although not limited to, cortical actin cytoskeleton, pseudopodia, phagocytosis, macropinocytic cup, and fatty acid beta-oxidation. Combined, the results from these analyses suggest that upregulated gene expression associated with lipid metabolism, oxidative stress response, protease activity, and cytoskeleton reorganisation is linked to pathogenicity in wild type N. perurans.

Results: Among 9,225 participants, 44.5% rated symptoms of PTSD, and 17.9 and 12.7% suffered from moderate and severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Individuals who were geographically located in Wuhan and familiar with someone who has COVID-19 had more severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, as well as a higher score in passive coping style (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that people who were geographically located in Wuhan [odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14C1.36, P < 0.001] were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD. Besides, individuals who were familiar with someone who had COVID-19 (OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 2.07C2.63, P < 0.001; OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.66C2.17, P < 0.001; OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.78C2.39, P < 0.001) and had a higher score in passive coping style (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.14C1.17, P < 0.001; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.15C1.19, P < 0.001; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.15C1.19, P < 0.001) were associated with severe symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Moreover, a higher score in active coping style (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.95C0.97, P < 0.001; OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.93C0.94, P < 0.001; OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.94C0.96, P < 0.001) was associated with a lower risk of symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Conclusions: During the midphase of COVID-19 outbreak, quite a few people have mental health problems; nearly half of the respondents rated symptoms of PTSD, and approximately one-fifth reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. Our findings may lead to better comprehend the psychological status of the general public and alleviate the public mental health crisis during the COVID-19 outbreak.","output":"The Psychological Status of General Population in Hubei Province During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND As we move towards a post-pandemic society, a question arises: How will the way we live look different in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic? AIM The aim of this survey was to evaluate changes in eating habits and other lifestyle behaviours (i.e., exercise and smoking) of people of almost all ages, who live in Greece, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A web-based survey using conventional sampling was conducted from during December 2020, in Greece. A total of 2258 individuals, aged 17 years and older voluntarily participated (912 (40%) men). RESULTS 89 (3.94%) of the participants reported that they had, or currently have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Moreover, 36.4% of the participants reported that they have changed their dietary habits during the pandemic towards a healthier diet - those participants had median age of 35 years, were of both sexes, 17% had co-morbidities and 69% with higher education level; moreover, 19% of those participants have started or increased the frequency of receiving dietary supplements that enhance the immune system, 34% of the participants reported that they gained weight during the pandemic period, whereas 19.8% reported that they have lost weight, and 37% of the participants reported that they have started or increased, as compared to the pre-pandemic time, their frequency of physical activities.

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease. In this study, the association between COVID-19 outcomes and vitamin D levels in patients attending a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City are examined. Methods Consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. All patients underwent clinical evaluation and follow-up, laboratory measurements and a thoracic computerized tomography, including the measurement of epicardial fat thickness. Low vitamin D was defined as levels <20 ng/ml (<50nmol/L) and deficient Vitamin D as a level 12 ng/ml (<30 nmol/L). Results Of the 551 patients included, low vitamin D levels were present in 45.6% and deficient levels in 10.9%. Deficient Vitamin D levels were associated with mortality (HR 2.11, 95%CI 1.24C3.58, p = 0.006) but not with critical COVID-19, adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index and epicardial fat. Using model-based causal mediation analyses the increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by low vitamin D levels was partly mediated by its effect on D-dimer and cardiac ultrasensitive troponins. Notably, increased risk of COVID-19 mortality conferred by low vitamin D levels was independent of BMI and epicardial fat. Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency (12 ng/ml or <30 nmol/L), is independently associated with COVID-19 mortality after adjustment for visceral fat (epicardial fat thickness). Low vitamin D may contribute to a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state, increasing the risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Serum Vitamin D Levels Are Associated With Increased COVID-19 Severity and Mortality Independent of Whole-Body and Visceral Adiposity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mike Taigman, Improvement Guide at FirstWatch, helps law enforcement and other agencies improve situational awareness, clinical performance, and patient outcomes by providing strategies to change mindsets and reframe challenging circumstances to help decrease anxiety or stress He shared his expertise for stress and anxiety management in the face of COVID-19 for law enforcement officials and other first responders in a webinar hosted by Lexipol","output":"Manage COVID-19 stress, anxiety by reframing your outlook"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to explore the experience of family care-givers of people with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Veneto region of Italy to understand how and to what extent the emergency has affected care-givers lives and care routines.

Interviews included exploration of the hub-and-spoke (centralized) e-consult model as a system redesign option. Qualitative content analysis procedures were applied to identify and describe salient categories. RESULTS Participants saw several potential benefits to scaling up e-consult delivery from a decentralized model to a hub-and-spoke model, including expanded access to specialist expertise and increased timeliness of e-consult responses. Concerns included differences in resource availability and management styles between sites, anticipated disruption to working relationships, lack of incentives for central e-consultants, dedicated staff's burnout and fatigue, technological challenges, and lack of motivation for change. DISCUSSION Based on a case study from one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the United States, our work identifies novel concerns and offers insights for healthcare organizations contemplating a scale-up of their e-consult systems.

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic safety and perioperative and long-term outcomes of choledochojejunostomy versus T-tube drainage for hepatolithiasis patients with sphincter of Oddi laxity (SOL). METHODS/DESIGN: In total, 210 patients who met the following eligibility criteria were included and were randomized to the choledochojejunostomy arm or T-tube drainage arm in a 1:1 ratio: (1) diagnosed with hepatolithiasis with SOL during surgery; (2) underwent foci removal, stone extraction and stricture correction during the operation; (3) provided written informed consent; (4) was willing to complete a 3-year follow-up; and (5) aged between 18 and 70 years. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial will be the incidence of biliary complications (stone recurrence, biliary stricture, cholangitis) during the 3 years after surgery. The secondary outcomes will be the surgical, perioperative and long-term follow-up outcomes. DISCUSSION: This is a prospective, single-centre and randomized controlled two-group parallel trial designed to demonstrate which drainage method (Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy or T-tube drainage) can better reduce biliary complications (stone recurrence, biliary stricture, cholangitis) in hepatolithiasis patients with SOL.

METHODS: A total of 1313 cases of children hospitalized in Hunan Provincial Peoples Hospital due to community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from April 2011 to May 2014 were enrolled in this study. Samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected for the cohort. WHO criteria for CAP grading was emerged for pneumonia severity classification. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect 12 kinds of respiratory viruses. HAdV types were identified by nested PCR. The relationship between HAdV load and severity of disease was there by analyzed. RESULTS: Finally, 174 cases (174/1313, 13.3%) were positive for HAdV, and HAdV type 7 (HAdV-7) was the main serotype (76/174, 43.7%). Among the 174 cases, 70 cases were with HAdV infection alone and 104 cases were accompanied by other viruses. The patients were divided into mild pneumonia group (n = 108 cases) and severe pneumonia group (n = 66 cases). HAdV load of children in severe pneumonia group was higher than that in mild pneumonia group. Similar result was obtained in the 70 cases with HAdV infection alone after subgrouping. Relevant factors analysis results showed that severe pneumonia children presented lower onset age, more prone to fever, longer fever time, and longer hospital stay compared with that of mild pneumonia children. Children with HAdV-7 infection developed more frequently severe pneumonia. Multivariate regression analysis showed that HAdV load, age, and fever time were risk factors for pneumonia severity.

The prevalence and prognostic implications of anemia in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with anemia. Methods. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all the articles published up to 1 September 2021, reporting data on the adjusted OR (aOR) for mortality among COVID-19 patients with anemia. The pooled prevalence of anemia among COVID-19 patients was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (aOR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I(2) statistic. Results. Five studies, enrolling 9.623 COVID-19 patients [3.707 males (38.5%)], met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of anemia was 25.6% of cases (95% CI: 8.3C56.5%), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 98.9%). Meta-regression showed that the anemia prevalence was influenced by a direct correlation with age (p = 0.007) and chronic kidney disease (p = 0.004) as moderating variables. Conversely, an inverse relationship was observed with male gender (p < 0.0001). Anemia was significantly associated with higher risk of short-term mortality (aOR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.28C2.24, p < 0.001), with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%). Conclusions.

Dysregulated immune response marks severe COVID-19, but the immunological mechanisms driving COVID-19 pathogenesis are still largely unknown, which is hampering the development of efficient treatments. Here we analyzed ~140 parameters of cellular and humoral immune response in peripheral blood of 41 COVID-19 patients and 16 age/gender-matched healthy donors by flow-cytometry, quantitative PCR, western blot and ELISA, followed by integrated correlation analyses with ~30 common clinical and laboratory parameters. We found that lymphocytopenia in severe COVID-19 patients (n=20) strongly affects T, NK and NKT cells, but not B cells and antibody production. Unlike increased activation of ICOS-1+ CD4+ T cells in mild COVID-19 patients (n=21), T cells in severe patients showed impaired activation, low IFN- production and high functional exhaustion, which correlated with significantly down-regulated HLA-DR expression in monocytes, dendritic cells and B cells. The latter phenomenon was followed by lower interferon responsive factor (IRF)-8 and autophagy-related genes expressions, and the expansion of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Intriguingly, PD-L1-, ILT-3-, and IDO-1-expressing monocytic MDSC were the dominant producers of IL-6 and IL-10, which correlated with the increased inflammation and accumulation of regulatory B and T cell subsets in severe COVID-19 patients. Overall, down-regulated IRF-8 and autophagy-related genes expression, and the expansion of MDSC subsets could play critical roles in dysregulating T cell response in COVID-19, which could have large implications in diagnostics and design of novel therapeutics for this disease.","output":"Reduced Expression of Autophagy Markers and Expansion of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Correlate With Poor T Cell Response in Severe COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses have unique lifestyles.

Similarly, the mechanisms, aftermath, and treatment of persistent RNA viruses emerged, in large part, from research on LCMV. Analysis of acute influenza virus infections uncovered the prominent direct role that cytokine storm plays in the pathogenesis, morbidity, and mortality from this disease. Cytokine storm of influenza virus infection is initiated via a pulmonary endothelial cell amplification loop involving IFN-producing cells and virus-infected pulmonary epithelial cells. Importantly, the cytokine storm is chemically treatable with specific agonist therapy directed to the sphingosphine 1 phosphate receptor 1, which is located on pulmonary endothelial cells, pointing to the endothelial cells as the gatekeepers of this hyperaggressive host immune response.","output":"Lessons learned and concepts formed from study of the pathogenesis of the two negative-strand viruses lymphocytic choriomeningitis and influenza."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a public health measure against COVID-19, South Africa restricted the sale of \\"tobacco, e-cigarettes and related products\\" for 5 months, ending on August 17, 2020.

We also analyzed heated tobacco product volume sales (kits) using retail scanner data from Nielsen Company. The 2661 e-cigarette liquids assessed online comprised cannabidiol liquids, 28.8%[767/2661], nicotine salts, 10.4%[276/2661], e-cigarette juice concentrates, 14.1%[376/2661], nicotine-free e-liquid, 4.0%[107/2661], and nicotine-containing e-liquid, 42.6%[1135/2661]. Cannabidiol liquids had the highest percentage of fruit (78.4%[601/767]) and tobacco flavors (9.4%[72/767]). During the restriction, many online e-cigarette vendors actively promoted cannabidiol liquid in lieu of regular e-liquid. Nielsen retail scanner data showed that volume of heated tobacco product sales in February 2020, preceding the restriction (7.76 million kits), were higher than in February 2019 (4.52 million kits).

In the current study, 14 (13%) residents and two (3.6%) HCS were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 28.6% (4/14) among the residents. The median age of the infected residents was 86.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 78.5C88] and 85.7% were women. Five residents were symptomatic (35.7%) and the others were asymptomatic (64.3%). A higher proportion of residents who succumbed to COVID-19 had hypertension than those who recovered. The SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing showed lineage B.6 which is rare globally but common regionally during the early phase of the pandemic. Household transmission is a potential source of introduction into the nursing home, with at least six epidemiologically linked secondary cases. Male residents were less implicated due to the staff segregation plan by block. Among residents, a higher proportion of the non-survivors were asymptomatic and had hypertension compared with survivors.","output":"Epidemiological, Clinical, and Phylogenetic Characteristics of the First SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in a Nursing Home of Singapore: A Prospective Observational Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Philanthropy is one of the most significant Islamic teachings and it has been practiced by Muhammadiyah, one of Indonesia's moderate Islamic organizations. As the pandemic of COVID-19 broke out many parties  including Muhammadiyah  were motivated to get involved in handling it. This research aims to reveal what Muhammadiyah has done and is currently doing to overcome COVID-19 and the extent of its impact on the wider community. For this purpose, the descriptive-analysis method is employed in its writing. Among the findings of this study is that one of the most consistent Islamic philanthropic organizations since its establishment in Indonesia is Muhammadiyah. In the COVID-19 issue Muhammadiyah has contributed a lot and continues to take a significant role in overcoming it. Among other things Muhammadiyah has formed the Muhammadiyah COVID-19 Command Centre (MCCC) which is a special team formed to handle COVID-19. This team has been working since it was founded and continues to work on this case. The results of the work included assistance in the field of health that is needed such as providing hospitals doctors medical personnel and medicine. Assistance in the field of education such as making educational media subsidizing credit for students and discounting student study fees. And assistance in the social sector such as cash assistance distribution of groceries and the provision of free sahur (food before fasting) and takjil (food for breaking fasting) in Ramadan 1441H. Besides through the Tarjih and Tajdid Assembly Muhammadiyah has provided religious guidance for its members during this pandemic so that they are not confused about practicing worship.

Getting an approximation of the number of patients attending the department can assist in service resources planning and prevent overcrowding.

Moreover, series forecasting is performed in two terms: long (four months ahead) and short (seven days ahead). The results show that time aggregations strongly influence the forecast quality, decreasing the effectiveness for one-day aggregations. In addition, best metrics are not obtained in the same aggregation, so there is no best aggregation for all cases.

Through investigating the factor structure, this study aimed to improve the FCRI and its usability. Therefore, we did a comprehensive comparison of the factor structure results of all translations, by exploring and improving the structure of the Dutch FCRI-NL and by testing this new factor structure in two patient samples. METHODS To compare factor structure results of FCRI translations, we did a literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar. We performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) in a mixed cancer sample. The confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were secondary analyses performed in two randomized controlled trial samples: consecutive breast cancer patients and distressed, mainly breast cancer patients. RESULTS All translations showed comparable and reasonable factor structure results; however, the FCRI factor structure can be improved. The EFA resulted in a four-factor solution: fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) severity, cognitive coping, impact of FCR on functioning and behavioural coping. However, the 4-factor CFAs did not fit the sample 2 and 3 data well. CONCLUSION Further exploring the FCRI-NL factor structure did not result in a psychometrically stronger FCRI-NL.

This article draws on the Active Ageing Index (AAI) to capture recent trends in active ageing in Italy with a focus on sub-national diversity. To this end, we compute AAI breakdowns by region separately for men and women for four different years: 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2018. Then, we use linear regression to describe the geographical and sex-specific patterns of change in the AAI over the considered period. The results demonstrate the diversity of regional outcomes and trends in the active ageing of Italian men and women, indicating that the widening geographic gap deserves further consideration by national and regional authorities in designing and implementing active ageing policies. By showing the persistence of disparities in the value of the indicator to the disadvantage of women, results also suggest the need to further integrate both the gender dimension and the life-cycle perspective into active ageing strategies. This article provides an example of how the AAI can be used as a practical tool by policy makers to monitor active ageing trends and outcomes at the sub-national level, and to identify target areas that require further action.","output":"Active Ageing: The Need to Address Sub-National Diversity.

This article describes the knowledge available on the antimicrobial role of tear lipids at the ocular surface and the antimicrobial potential of various lipid classes present in tears that can contribute to antimicrobial protection of the eye. Like other mucosal secretions, tears contain many proteins and lipids with known antimicrobial effects. The antimicrobial defense of tears is far stronger than can be demonstrated by the effects of individual compounds many of which are present in low concentrations but synergistic and additive interactions between them provide substantial antimicrobial protection to the ocular surface. It is inferred that antimicrobial lipids play important role in innate defense of tears, and cooperative interactions between various antimicrobial lipids and proteins in tears provide a potent host defense mechanism that is effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens and renders self-sterilizing properties to tears for keeping the microbial load low at the ocular surface.","output":"Antimicrobial Tear Lipids in the Ocular Surface Defense"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSI) with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

METHODS: A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed at two academic hospitals in Montreal, Canada. Patients &#8805; 18 years of age with MSSA BSI receiving either cefazolin or cloxacillin monotherapy were considered for inclusion. In addition to the standard of care treatment, participants received a 5-day course of adjunctive daptomycin or placebo. The primary outcome was the duration of MSSA BSI in days. RESULTS: Of 318 participants screened, 115 were enrolled and 104 were included in the intention to treat analysis (median age 67 years; 34.5% female). The median duration of bacteremia was 2.04 days among patients who received daptomycin versus 1.65 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference 0.39 days, p=0.40).

The goal of this study was to find acceptable and adaptive coping techniques for nurses in order to keep the healthcare system resilient during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: The scoping review search took place from January 2020 to May 2021 published articles, and the results were saved in Endnote software. For data synthesis and review, the Joanna Briggs Institute manual and PRISMA-ScR principles were followed. Following backward and forward screening to exclude redundant, irrelevant, and ineligible studies, 13 studies (3,613 nurses) were finally selected for this review. RESULTS: The majorities of participants in these studies were female and had children, and worked in departments of critical care, emergency, and fever clinics. Safety concerns for family or colleagues, as well as a lack of safe working environment, were the primary causes of the mental illness. Professional responsibility attitude, COVID-19 training, workplace safety, team spirit, and a few relaxation activities such as deep breathing, reading books, watching movies, and praying, on the other hand, were found to be beneficial for stress coping among nurses. CONCLUSION: Mentally fit nurses are more capable and flexible in the face of any life-threatening outbreak, even if it is very contagious. Several coping strategies were found to be effective for nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas problem-specific intervention trials might yield even better results.

However, sensitive information can be derived from movement patterns, thus protecting the privacy of mobile users is a major concern. Users may only be willing to disclose their locations when some condition is met, for instance in proximity of a disaster area or an event of interest. Currently, such functionality can be achieved using searchable encryption. Such cryptographic primitives provide provable guarantees for privacy, and allow decryption only when the location satisfies some predicate. Nevertheless, they rely on expensive pairing-based cryptography (PBC), of which direct application to the domain of location updates leads to impractical solutions. We propose secure and efficient techniques for private processing of location updates that complement the use of PBC and lead to significant gains in performance by reducing the amount of required pairing operations. We implement two optimizations that further improve performance: materialization of results to expensive mathematical operations, and parallelization. We also propose an heuristic that brings down the computational overhead through enlarging an alert zone by a small factor (given as system parameter), therefore trading off a small and controlled amount of privacy for significant performance gains. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly improve performance compared to the baseline, and reduce the searchable encryption overhead to a level that is practical in a computing environment with reasonable resources, such as the cloud.","output":"A Secure Location-based Alert System with Tunable Privacy-Performance Trade-off"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To survey runners and triathletes about their willingness to resume in-person racing during the COVID-19 pandemic, health concerns related to mass races and changes in running patterns since the start of the pandemic.

METHODS 116 individuals with AD were surveyed about the occurrence of 23 autoimmune diseases among their relatives. RESULTS 74.1% of persons with AD reported at least one relative with an autoimmune disorder - 257 cases were diagnosed in 221 relatives. Hashimoto's thyroiditis was found in 100 individuals, followed by Graves' disease and vitiligo - in 25 and 24 relatives, respectively. Type 1 diabetes was diagnosed in 23 relatives, psoriasis in 15, rheumatoid arthritis in 12, pernicious anaemia in 11, multiple sclerosis in 8, while premature menopause in 8 women. AD was found in 7 relatives, alopecia in 6, and celiac disease in 5. Other conditions were rare. Significant correlation was noticed between the number of autoimmune conditions in AD proband and the number of affected relatives (p = 0.031). 66.4% of people with AD had a first-degree relative suffering from autoimmunity.

With the digitization of health care and the wide availability of health apps, a more diverse range of eHealth skills is required to properly use such health facilities. Existing EHL measurements focus mainly on the skill of obtaining health information (Web 1.0), whereas skills for web-based interactions (Web 2.0) and self-managing health data and applying information (Web 3.0) have not been well measured. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an EHL scale (eHLS) termed eHLS-Web3.0 comprising a comprehensive spectrum of Web 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 skills to measure EHL, and evaluate its validity and reliability along with the measurement invariance among college students. METHODS: In study 1, 421 Chinese college students (mean age 20.5, SD 1.4 years; 51.8% female) and 8 health experts (mean age 38.3, SD 5.9 years; 87.5% female) were involved to develop the eHLS-Web3.0. The scale development included three steps: item pool generation, content validation, and exploratory factor analysis. In study 2, 741 college students (mean age 21.3, SD 1.4 years; 52.2% female) were recruited from 4 Chinese cities to validate the newly developed eHLS-Web3.0. The construct validity, convergent validity, concurrent validity, internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and measurement invariance across genders, majors, and regions were examined by a series of statistical analyses, including confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multigroup CFAs using SPSS and Mplus software packages. RESULTS: Based on the item pool of 374 statements collected during the conceptual development, 24 items (4-10 items per subscale) were generated and adjusted after cognitive testing and content validity examination. Through exploratory factor analysis, a 3-factor eHLS-Web3.0 was finally developed, and it included acquisition (8 items), verification (6 items), and application (10 items). In study 2, CFAs supported the construct validity of the 24-item 3D eHLS-Web3.0 ((2)(244)=903.076, (2)(244)=3.701, comparative fit index=0.924, Tucker-Lewis index=0.914, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.06, and standardized root mean residual [SRMR]=0.051). The average variance extracted (AVE) value of 0.58 and high correlation between eHLS-Web3.0 subscales and the eHealth Literacy Scale (r=0.725-0.880, P<.001) indicated the convergent validity and concurrent validity of the eHLS-Web3.0. The results also indicated satisfactory internal consistency reliability (=.976, =0.934-0.956) and test-retest reliability (r=0.858, P<.001) of the scale.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of lung cancer (LC) patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Three thousand seven-hundred and fifty hospitalized patients with a presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 in a tertiary referral hospital between March 2020-February 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. Among them, 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a history of primary LC were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with severe disease. Result: Of the 36 patients included in the study, 28 (77%) were males and 8 (23%) were females. Median age was 67 years (min-max: 53-81 years). Six patients (17%) had a diagnosis of small cell LC, whereas 30 patients (83%) had a diagnosis of non-small cell LC. The most common symptoms were fever (n= 28, 77%), coughing and myalgia (n= 21, 58%) and dyspnea (n= 18, 50%). The most common radiological finding was ground glass opacity (GGO) (n= 30), of which 13 was bilateral and 17 was unilateral in distribution. Nearly 30% (n= 11) of LC patients with COVID-19 developed severe disease, 5% (n= 2) of the 36 patients were admitted to intensive care unit and all of these patients eventually expired. LC patients with COVID-19 and patchy consolidation on computed tomography of thorax (Th CT) on admission had a higher risk of developing severe disease in univariate (HR 2.41, 95%CI: 1.4- 4.4, p= 0.04) and multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR 0.48, 95%CI: 0.24-0.97, p= 0.03). Conclusions: Clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiographic findings were similar in LC patients with COVID-19 when compared with the general population, LC patients have a higher mortality rate than the general population, with a 5% mortality rate in our series.

The majority of patients, 70 of 101 (69%), were symptomatic. Most common symptoms reported were fever in 34/70 (49%), cough in 31/70 (44%), and headache in 19/70 (27%). A higher percentage of candidates (31%, 4 of 13) were hospitalized for acute COVID-19 infection compared to (17%, 15 of 90) of recipients. A transplant candidate who ultimately died from underlying illness and COVID-19 was the only patient in the cohort who required mechanical ventilation. More deaths (2/13, 15%) occurred in transplant candidates with COVID-19 compared to transplant recipients with COVID-19 (1/90, 1%, p=0.04); however, 2 of the deaths occurred after recovery from acute COVID-19 illness. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that pediatric candidates who are actively listed for transplant with underlying conditions have more severe acute COVID-19 illness than pediatric SOT recipients despite their immunosuppression based on the higher mortality observed in the transplant candidates. Prospective studies are needed to better understand which specific patients are at increased risk for mortality from COVID-19.

AIM: Here, we investigated the clinical value of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in patients with midline shift and supratentorial ICH by observing the consciousness state, midline shift, and short-term mortality. MATERIAL & METHODS: 124 supratentorial ICH patients with midline shift, hematoma volume > 30 mL and <150 ml were included in this study. Based on treatment methods, the enrolled patients were divided into minimally invasive surgical (MIS) (group 1, n=61) and conservative (group 2, n=63) treatment groups. Measurements of midline shift and state of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS score) were performed on day 2 following treatment. Additionally, mortality, adverse events, and neurological recovery (Modified Rankin Scale score) in each group were observed after one month. RESULTS: On day 2 postoperative, the recovery rates of midline shift and consciousness state in group 1 patients were 59.02% and 50.82%, respectively, significantly higher than group 2, 26.98% and 25.40% (P < 0.01). By comparing death, adverse events, and neurological function recovery of the two groups within one month postoperative, we observed a significantly lower fatality rate in group 1 [16.39% (10 cases)] than group 2 [33.33% (21 cases)] (P < 0.05). No significant difference of the adverse event rates was observed between group 1 and 2 [19.67% (12 cases) versus 19.05% (12 cases)]. In addition, neurological function recovery also had no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MIS could reduce early-stage midline shift, improve consciousness state and reduce short-term mortality in patients with supratentorial ICH.","output":"Reduction of Midline Shift and Short-term Mortality following Minimal Invasive Surgery for Spontaneous Supratentorial Intracerebral Hemorrhage A Retrospective and Case-control Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The results of an analysis of trends in the development of the information ecosystem of open science based on the study of the global document flow, open access resources, and scientific data repositories, as well as initiatives in the field of open science, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, are presented.

Phylodynamic and transmission analysis allowed to attribute specific clades as well as infer their importation routes. Thus, the first two waves of positive case increase were caused by the 20B clade, the third peak caused by the 20I (Alpha), while the last two peaks were caused by the 21J (Delta) and 21K (Omicron) variants. The functional analyses of mutations in sequences largely affected epitopes associated with protective HLA loci and did not cause the loss of the signal in PCR tests targeting ORF1ab and N genes as confirmed by RT-PCR.

The objective of this study was to measure the impact of in-situ simulation on the confidence of the surgical teams of two hospitals in assessing and managing acutely unwell surgical patients who are high-risk or confirmed to have COVID-19. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design. The surgical teams at each hospital participated in multi-disciplinary simulation sessions to explore the assessment and management of a patient requiring emergency surgery who is high risk for COVID-19. The participants were surveyed before and after receiving simulation training to determine their level of confidence on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for the premise stated in each of the nine questions in the survey, which represented multiple aspects of the care of these patients. RESULTS: 27 participants responded the pre-simulation survey and 24 the one post-simulation. The level of confidence (VAS score) were statistically significantly higher for all nine questions after the simulation. Specific themes were identified for further training and changes in policy.

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of severe pneumonia and has rapidly spread through many nations, crashing health systems and leading a large number of people to death. In Brazil, the emergence of local epidemics in major metropolitan areas has always been a concern. In a vast and heterogeneous country, with regional disparities and climate diversity, several factors can modulate the dynamics of COVID-19. What should be the scenario for inner Brazil, and what can we do to control infection transmission in each of these locations? Here, a mathematical model is proposed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by abiotic factors, social-economic factors, and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The disease control relies on keeping all individuals' social distancing and detecting, followed by isolating, infected ones. The model reinforces social distancing as the most efficient method to control disease transmission. Moreover, it also shows that improving the detection and isolation of infected individuals can loosen this mitigation strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of control may be different across the country, and understanding it can help set up public health strategies.","output":"Addressing the COVID-19 transmission in inner Brazil by a mathematical model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have demonstrated a novel compatibility (or correspondence) effect between physical stimulus size and horizontally aligned responses: Left-hand responses are shorter and more accurate to a small stimulus, compared to a large stimulus, whereas the opposite is true for right-hand responses. The present study investigated whether relative or absolute size is responsible for the effect. If relative size was important, a particular stimulus would elicit faster left-hand responses if the other stimuli in the set were larger, but the same stimulus would elicit a faster right-hand response if the other stimuli in the set were smaller. In terms of two-visual-systems theory, our study explores whether vision for perception (i.e., the ventral system) or vision for action (i.e., the dorsal system) dominates the processing of stimulus size in our task. In two experiments, participants performed a discrimination task in which they responded to stimulus color (Experiment 1) or to stimulus shape (Experiment 2) with their left/right hand. Stimulus size varied as an irrelevant stimulus feature, thus leading to corresponding (small-left; large-right) and non-corresponding (small-right; large-left) conditions. Moreover, a set of smaller stimuli and a set of larger stimuli, with both sets sharing an intermediately sized stimulus, were used in different conditions. The consistently significant two-way interaction between stimulus size and response location demonstrated the presence of the correspondence effect. The three-way interaction between stimulus size, response location, and stimulus set, however, was never significant. The results suggest that participants are inadvertently classifying stimuli according to relative size in a context-specific manner.","output":"Relative, not absolute, stimulus size is responsible for a correspondence effect between physical stimulus size and left/right responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims: The incidence of CMPA in infancy seems to be approximately 3%. In Italy diagnosis of CMPA is often over estimated. The double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge(DBPCFC) is widely considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of food allergy. Methods: 14 patients, (12 months-12 yrs) previously diagnosed as having CMPA, underwent our diagnostic algorithm in order to confirm or to exclude diagnosis. Diagnostic algorithm includes: total blood cell count, serum IgE assay, RAST, betalactotest, Prick by prick with fresh milk, chemical examination and eosinophilic cell count of the stools. DBPCFC was performed with extensively hydrolyzed formula (as placebo) VS a lactose-free, cow milk derived formula. At discharge a post challenge form was given to parents to record delayed symptoms that might occur at home. Results: 12 out of 14 patients had positive results for skin prick test (prick by prick) and four out of them also presented specific IgE against CMPs. 13 patients showed tolerance to CMP during and after DBPCFC and had no symptoms also in the next 72h. Only one patient, aged 30 months, had to keep CMP avoidance. Conclusion: In our survey DBPCFC demonstrated tolerance to CMP for all but one patients. DBPCFC is effective also to disconfirm diagnosis of CMPA. Skin prick tests and serological specific IgE do not always correlate with oral tolerance test.

METHOD: Numerator data, number of children with CP born a singleton between 1995 and 2014, confirmed at 5 years of age, were drawn from three state registers with population-level ascertainment. Birth prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated per 1000 singleton live births for the three states combined, overall, by gestational age group, by dichotomized disability severity, and spastic laterality. Poisson regression models were used to analyse trends. Using data from all eight registers, trends in the proportional distribution of CP subtypes overall and stratified by gestational age were examined. RESULTS: Birth prevalence of CP declined from 1.8 (95% CI 1.6-2.0) in 1995 to 1996 to 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.4) in 2013 to 2014 (average 5% per 2-year epoch, p < 0.001).

This game has indirectly drawn greater public attention to public health issues by simulating pathogen transmission and disease symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Against this backdrop, this research investigates whether the gameful experience of Plague Inc. has indirectly affected public knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was conducted through social networking services in Taiwan from May 6-28, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 486 subjects participated in this study, of which 276 (56.8%) had played Plague Inc. This study had several findings. First, participants who had played Plague Inc. demonstrated higher levels of knowledge (P=.03, median 7, IQR 7-8) and attitudes (P=.007, median 8, IQR 7-8) than participants who had not played Plague Inc.

As this test is mainly applied on persons with symptomatic disease, it may overlook individuals with pauci- or a-symptomatic infection. Seroprevalence studies are thus essential to get an accurate estimate of the actual SARS-CoV-2 diffusion within the populations. We report on the findings of the first serosurvey conducted in the capital city of Tunisia prior to the implementation of mass vaccination and analyzed factors associated with seropositivity. Methods: : A cross sectional survey was conducted among households living in two areas of the governorate of Tunis, the capital city of the country. The survey was realized between March and April 2021, spanning the end of the second wave and the beginning of the third wave of COVID-19 and prior to the implementation of mass vaccination in Tunisia. SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the spike (S-RBD) or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were detected using an in-house ELISA test. Results were adjusted for test performance. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors independently associated with SARS-COV-2 seropositivity. Results: : The survey included 1676 individuals from 431 households. The mean age and sex ratio were 43.320.9 years and 0.6 respectively. The weighted and test-performance adjusted prevalence of IgG antibodies to the N and the S-RBD proteins were 26.6% [22.9-30.8] and 25.1% [22.2-28.4] respectively. The weighted seroprevalence of anti-N and/or anti-S-RBD IgG antibodies was equal to 38.0% [34.6-41.5]. In multivariate analysis, age under 10, no tobacco use, previous diagnosis of COVID-19, a history of COVID-19 related symptoms and contact with a COVID-19 case within the household, were independently associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Conclusions: : After the end of the second epidemic wave, more than one third of people living in Tunis got antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, the present study aimed to synthesize, qualitatively and quantitatively, information on the prevalence and characteristics of malaria infection among COVID-19-infected individuals. The findings will help us better understand this particular comorbidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The systematic review protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with the identification number: CRD42021247521. We searched for studies reporting on the coinfection of COVID-19 and malaria in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to March 27, 2021 using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. The studys methodological quality in the search output was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools for cross-sectional study. The pooled prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection among patients infected with COVID-19 was estimated using the random effect model and then graphically presented as forest plots. The heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using Cochrane Q and I(2) statistics. The characteristics of patients co-infected with COVID-19 and malaria were derived from case reports and series and were formally analyzed using simple statistics. RESULTS: Twelve of 1,207 studies reporting the coinfection of COVID-19 and malaria were selected for further analysis. Results of quantitative synthesis show that the pooled prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection (364 cases) among COVIDC19 individuals (1,126 cases) is 11%, with a high degree of heterogeneity (95% CI: 4%C18%, I(2): 97.07%, 5 studies). Most of the coinfections were reported in Nigeria (336 cases), India (27 cases), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (1 case). Results of qualitative synthesis indicate that patients with coinfection are typically symptomatic at presentation with mild or moderate parasitemia. An analysis of case reports and series indicates that co-infected individuals often display thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated bilirubin levels. Among four patients (30%) who required treatment with intravenous artesunate, one experienced worsened clinical status after administering the drug. One serious outcome of coinfection involved a pregnant woman who experienced fetal abortion due to the initial misdiagnosis of malaria. CONCLUSIONS: All individuals in malaria-endemic regions who are febrile or display symptoms of COVID-19 should be evaluated for malaria to avoid serious complications. Further prospective studies are required to investigate the burden and outcomes of COVID-19 in malaria-endemic regions.

Measuring airway pH is challenging;direct measurement requires bronchoscopy and is only reflective of the pH of the areas reachable by bronchoscopy. Airway pH can be indirectly measured by exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pH and changes in exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Both of these indirect methods are sensitive for detecting changes in airway pH but nonspecific with regards to the location within the airways they represent. Airway pH can be increased by inhalation of Optate, an alkaline medication designed for inhalation, and Optate inhibits SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A (FluA), Influenza B (FluB), and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. A non-invasive method for measuring airway pH compartmentally would allow for detection of local airway pH imbalances and also monitoring compartmental response to inhaled Optate. We hypothesized that inhalation of Optate would result in compartmental changes in eNO representative of areas of deposition of inhaled Optate. Finally, we hypothesized that inhalation of Optate from vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) would result in a more significant and distal change in eNO than inhalation from a small volume jet nebulizer (SVN).Methods: Compartmental eNO was measured in healthy human subjects and subjects with asthma before and immediately after inhalation of Optate from VMN and SVN on two different visit (a different nebulizer for each visit). Compartmental eNO measurement consists of three exhalations at different flow rates: 30 mL/sec (representing tracheal eNO), 100 mL/sec (representing eNO from the middle airways), and 300 mL/sec (representing acinar eNO). % change was compared in each compartment of each subject after inhalation of Optate. Results: eNO decreased significantly in all compartments (n = 10, p &lt; 0.001), but not equally (Figure). Delivery of Optate by VMN resulted in a significantly greater decrease in eNO than delivery by SVN (n = 18, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Compartmental eNO can be measured by collection of eNO at different expiratory flow rates. Inhalation of Optate alters compartmental eNO differentially, which may allow for the evaluation of compartmental airway pH changes. The greater decrease in eNO after delivery of Optate by VMN compared to SVN suggests that VMN may result in greater airway deposition of medication.","output":"Compartmental Exhaled Nitric Oxide Measurement: A Non-Invasive Method for Mapping the pH of the Airways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: La Socit Fran?aise de Chirurgie Rachidienne (SFCR) a des recommandations pendant la pandmie COVID.

We identified a single strain within the screening panel that was able to effectively utilize inulin and FOS, which did not support efficient growth of the rest of the strains. In our panel tested, we did not find strains that could utilize arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides or sulfated fucoidan. The strain-specific growth phenotype on isomalto-oligosaccharides was further analyzed using high performance anion exchange chromatography and revealed distinct substrate utilization phenotypes within the strain panel. The strain-specific phenotypes could be linked to the strain's genotypes identifying gene clusters encoding for carbohydrate membrane transport systems that are predicted to be involved in the utilization of isomaltose and other (unidentified) oligosaccharides in the isomalto-oligosaccharide substrate.IMPORTANCE Synbiotics combine the concepts of prebiotics and probiotics to synergistically enhance the health benefits associated with these ingredients.

Hyperhydration (using sodium and glycerol osmolytes), and internal and external pre-and in-race cooling methods were also utilized. A low energy availability intervention was implemented with two athletes, as a strategy to periodize ideal race body composition. Race performance data and environmental conditions from the 2021 Olympic Games were also documented. RESULTS: The highest values for aerobic capacity were 63.6 mL?kg(C1)?min(C1) for female race walkers and 73.7 mL?kg(C1)?min(C1) for males. Training volume for the six athletes was the highest in the second week of the team holding camp, and training intensity was lowest in the first week of the team holding camp. Performance outcomes included 6th place in the womens 20 km event (1:30:39), which was within 2% of her 20 km personal best time, and 8th place in the mens 50 km event (3:52:01), which was a personal best performance time. CONCLUSION: Periodized training, heat acclimation/acclimatization, cooling and nutritional strategies study may have contributed to the race outcomes in Olympic Games held hot, humid conditions, for the race walkers within this observational study.","output":"Competing in Hot Conditions at the Tokyo Olympic Games: Preparation Strategies Used by Australian Race Walkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Fed?s recent corporate-bond buying program is approached from a political economy perspective, placing it in the context of its interventions during the 2008 crisis, and the broader swathe of facilities launched in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, many cases of schizophrenia remain untreated due to failure to diagnose, self-denial, and social stigma. With the advent of social media, individuals suffering from schizophrenia share their mental health problems and seek support and treatment options. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used for detecting schizophrenia from social media posts. This study aims to determine whether machine learning could be effectively used to detect signs of schizophrenia in social media users by analyzing their social media texts. To this end, we collected posts from the social media platform Reddit focusing on schizophrenia, along with non-mental health related posts (fitness, jokes, meditation, parenting, relationships, and teaching) for the control group. We extracted linguistic features and content topics from the posts. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts belonging to schizophrenia and interpreted important features to identify linguistic markers of schizophrenia. We applied unsupervised clustering to the features to uncover a coherent semantic representation of words in schizophrenia. We identified significant differences in linguistic features and topics including increased use of third person plural pronouns and negative emotion words and symptom-related topics. We distinguished schizophrenic from control posts with an accuracy of 96%. Finally, we found that coherent semantic groups of words were the key to detecting schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches could help us understand the linguistic characteristics of schizophrenia and identify schizophrenia or otherwise at-risk individuals using social media texts.","output":"Schizophrenia Detection Using Machine Learning Approach from Social Media Content"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: PJI is the most dramatic complication after joint arthroplasty. In patients with chronic infection, prosthesis exchange is in theory the rule. However, this surgical approach is sometimes not desirable especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, as it could be associated with a dramatic loss of function, reduction of the bone stock, fracture, or peroperative death. We propose here to report different approaches that can help to maintain the function in such patients based on a pathophysiology-, multidisciplinary-, and an experience-based approach. METHODS: We describe the different points that are needed to treat such patients: (i) the multidisciplinary care management; (ii) understanding the mechanism of bacterial persistence; (iii) optimization of the conservative surgical approach; (iv) use of suppressive antimicrobial therapy (SAT); (v) implementation of innovative agents that could be used locally to target the biofilm. RESULTS: In France, a nation-wide network called CRIOAc has been created and funded by the French Health ministry to manage complex bone and joint infection. Based on the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of PJI, it seems to be feasible to propose conservative surgical treatment such as \\"debridement antibiotics and implant retention\\" (with or without soft-tissue coverage) followed by SAT to control the disease progression. Finally, there is a rational for the use of particular agents that have the ability to target the bacteria embedded in biofilm such as bacteriophages and phage lysins. DISCUSSION: This multistep approach is probably a key determinant to propose innovative management in patients with complex PJI, to improve the outcome. CONCLUSION: Conservative treatment has a high potential in patients with chronic PJI for whom explantation is not desirable. The next step will be to evaluate such practices in nation-wide clinical trials.","output":"Medical innovations to maintain the function in patients with chronic PJI for whom explantation is not desirable: a pathophysiology-, multidisciplinary-, and experience-based approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the global pandemic of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) agent, impeding the basic research into its biology and the development of effective antivirals. Here, we developed a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) cell culture system for production of transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP). This trVLP expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N), which is required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2 GFP/&#916;N trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be achieved and exclusively confined in the cells ectopically expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, but not MERS-CoV N. Genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in the N-expressing cells. Moreover, intein-mediated protein trans-splicing approach was utilized to split the viral N gene into two independent vectors, and the ligated viral N protein could function in trans to recapitulate entire viral life cycle, further securing the biosafety of this cell culture model. Based on this BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 cell culture model, we developed a 96-well format high throughput screening for antivirals discovery. We identified salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium, lycorine chloride and nigericin sodium as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, we developed a convenient and efficient SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics tool to dissect the virus life cycle under a BSL-2 condition.

Among them, 784 human proteins were found to be interactors of human OGT. Moreover, these proteins spanned a very diverse range of functional classes (e.g., DNA repair, RNA metabolism, translational regulation, and cell cycle), with significant enrichment in regulating transcription and (co)translation.

Currently, data on PD-L1 expression and its prognostic value in Indonesian TNBC patients are still relatively unknown. This study aimed to investigate the expression of PD-L1 in Indonesian TNBC patients as preliminary proof to support PD-L1 inhibitor as a possible treatment option near in the future. METHODS: We retrospectively included stage I-III TNBC patients diagnosed between 2014 and 2017 in Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Clinical variables were collected from medical record.

The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 58.3%. Overexpression of PD-L1 mRNA in TNBC patients is associated with worse prognosis (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant associations between PD-L1 mRNA expression and any of the clinicopathologic variables examined. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, PD-L1 mRNA overexpression is associated with worse survival in Indonesian TNBC patients, independent of other established risk factors.

NPIs involve numerous measurements like hygiene rules or contact restriction that are applied during given situations, while so far only limited quantitative data exist to rate the overall effectiveness. Methods Using the official counts of Robert Koch Institute in Berlin/Germany, press reports and Twitter messages, the early phase of the current COVID-19/Sars-CoV2 in Bavaria is being reconstructed. Results The first cases have been observed in Munich by the end of January 2020. While the initial outbreak could be sufficiently covered using isolation and quarantine measurements, the consecutive early spreading falls into three phases, starting with winter school holidays at the end of February, a number of beer festivals in the following week, and general elections on March, 15. The disaster plan on March, 16 indicates the end of the early phase. Using the official case counts, a rather coherent picture evolves although representative epidemiological studies are still missing. The epidemic started with a few cases during the winter holidays, increased exponentially afterwards including significant more cases by beer festivals and another significant excess of cases following the election that occurred in Bavaria only. Compared to other German countries, Bavaria reached the highest prevalence which could not be reversed by even the most restrictive containment measurements.

Coinciding with these changes, popular pornography websites made some previously premium content available for free, spurring dramatic increases in traffic to these websites. This increase in time spent at home and reported increases in traffic to specific pornographic websites led to some speculation that pornography use might generally increase over the course of the pandemic and that problematic use might also increase. To test these speculations and quantify the effects of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on social behaviors on pornography use, we analyzed data from a longitudinal sample of American adults. Baseline, nationally representative data were collected in August, 2019 via YouGov (N=2,518). Subsequent data were collected in February, 2020 (n=1,677), May, 2020 (n=1,533), August, 2020 (n=1,470), and October, 2020 (n=1,269). Results indicated that, in May, 2020, immediately following the height of the first wave of pandemic related lockdowns, more people reported past month pornography use than at any other time point. Among those who reported use in May, 2020, only 14% reported increases in use since the start of the pandemic, and their use returned to levels similar to all other users by August of 2020. In general, pornography use trended downward over the pandemic, for both men and women. Problematic pornography use trended downward for men and remained low and unchanged in women. Collectively, these results suggests that many fears about pornography use during pandemic related lockdowns were largely not supported by available data.","output":"Porndemic?

In recent years, these institutions have increasingly turned to Mixed Reality (MR) technologies to expand and democratize public access to Cultural Heritage - a trend that is called upon to accelerate with COVID-19 - because these technologies provide opportunities for more remote outreach, and moreover, can make partial remains or ruins more relatable to the public. But as emerging evaluations indicate, existing MR intangible and tangible Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) applications are largely proving inadequate to engaging audiences beyond an initial fascination with the immersive 3D visualization of heritage sites and artefacts owing in part to misguided storytelling or non-compelling narratives. They fail to effectively communicate the significance of Cultural Heritage to audiences and impress upon them its value in a lasting way due to their overreliance on an education-entertainment-touristic consumption paradigm. Building on the recent case made for Literature-based MR Presence, this article examines how the literary tradition of travel narratives can be recruited to enhance presence and embodiment, and further elicit aesthetic experiences in Digital Cultural Heritage applications by drawing on recent findings from the fields of Extended Reality (XR), cognitive literary science and new museology. The projected effects of this innovative approach are not limited to an increase in audience engagement on account of a greater sense of presence and embodiment. This approach is also expected to prompt a different kind of public involvement characterized by a personal valuation of the heritage owing to aesthetic experience. As the paper ultimately discusses, this response is more compatible both with MR applications' default mode of usership, and with newly emerging conceptions of a user-centered museum (e.g., the Museum 3.0), thereby providing a narrative roadmap for future Virtual Museum (VM) applications better suited to the primary mission of transmitting and perpetuating Cultural Heritage. ?

Several CPPs were found in the proteome of viruses such as Tat originated from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), and VP22 derived from herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). In the current study, a wide-range of CPPs was identified in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2, a new member of coronaviruses family, using in silico analyses. These CPPs may play a main role for high penetration of virus into cells and infection of host. At first, we submitted the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 to CellPPD web server that resulted in a huge number of CPPs with ten residues in length. Afterward, we submitted the predicted CPPs to C2Pred web server for evaluation of the probability of each peptide. Then, the uptake efficiency of each peptide was investigated using CPPred-RF and MLCPP web servers. Next, the physicochemical properties of the predicted CPPs including net charge, theoretical isoelectric point (pI), amphipathicity, molecular weight, and water solubility were calculated using protparam and pepcalc tools. In addition, the probability of membrane binding potential and cellular localization of each CPP were estimated by Boman index using APD3 web server, D factor, and TMHMM web server. On the other hand, the immunogenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, hemolytic potency, and half-life of CPPs were predicted using various web servers. Finally, the tertiary structure and the helical wheel projection of some CPPs were predicted by PEP-FOLD3 and Heliquest web servers, respectively. These CPPs were divided into: a) CPP containing tumor homing motif (RGD) and/or tumor penetrating motif (RXXR); b) CPP with the highest Boman index; c) CPP with high half-life (~100 hour) in mammalian cells, and d) CPP with +5.00 net charge. Based on the results, we found a large number of novel CPPs with various features. Some of these CPPs possess tumor-specific motifs which can be evaluated in cancer therapy. Furthermore, the novel and potent CPPs derived from SARS-CoV-2 may be used alone or conjugated to some sequences such as nuclear localization sequence (NLS) for vaccine and drug delivery.","output":"Exploring novel and potent cell penetrating peptides in the proteome of SARS-COV-2 using bioinformatics approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the re-envisioning of a school of social work into a School of Social Work and Social Justice.

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Medical College of Georgia using a sample of convenience. Enrolled first-, second-, and third-year students were invited to complete a survey during the Spring 2020 semester. A total of 194 students responded to specific questions about training on and knowledge of ACEs and principles of TIC. RESULTS The majority of students (80%) indicated they heard of the ACEs Study, and 70% reported they received information about ACEs. Regarding TIC, findings indicated less knowledge on cultural context related to stress and trauma. In addition, first-year students were less likely to know about TIC principles than third-year students. CONCLUSION This preliminary study is the first of its kind in the state of Georgia, where recent surveillance data indicate that 60% of adults have experienced at least one ACE.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study on patients with preoperative colorectal neoplasia, between October 2018 and July 2021. Physical performance was evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test and hand grip strength (HGS). For a decrease in physical performance, SPPB < 10 points or HGS below the EWGSOP2 cut-off points was considered. Nutritional status was evaluated using subjective global assessment (SGA). The prevalence of postoperative complications and mortality during admission, at 1 month, and at 6 months was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients, mean age 60.4  12.8 years, 59.3% male, were evaluated. The mean BMI was 27.6  5.1 kg/m2. The mean total SPPB score was 10.57  2.07 points.

A total of 58 patients presented low HGS (19.6%). SGA found 40.2% (119) of patients with normal nourishment, 32.4% (96) with moderate malnutrition, and 27.4% (81) with severe malnutrition. Postoperative complications were more frequent in patients with a low SPPB score (60.3% vs. 38.6%; p = 0.002) and low HGS (64.9% vs. 39.3%, p = 0.001). A low SPPB test score (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.37-4.79, p = 0.003) and low HGS (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.37-5.29, p = 0.004) were associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications after adjusting for tumor stage and age. Patients with a low SPPB score presented an increase in in-hospital mortality (8.7% vs. 0.9%; p = 0.021), at 1 month (8.7% vs. 1.3%; p = 0.002) and at 6 months (13.1% vs. 2.2%, p < 0.001).

As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug developments, Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly evaluated the binding energetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to find the key residues. Although the overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, the difference in binding affinity is as large as -16.35 kcal/mol. Energy decomposition analyses identified three binding patches in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues (Phe486, Tyr505, Asn501, Tyr489, Gln493, Leu455 and etc) which are believed to be the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces are from van der Waals attractions and dehydration of these residues. It is also worth mention that we found seven mutational sites (Lys417, Leu455, Ala475, Gly476, Glu484, Gln498 and Val503) on SARS-CoV-2 which unexpectedly weakened the RBD-ACE2 binding. Very interestingly, the most repulsive residue at the RBD-ACE2 interface (E484), is found to be mutated in the latest UK variant, B1.1.7, cause complete virus neutralization escapes from highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Our present results indicate that at least from the energetic point of view such E484 mutation may have beneficial effects on ACE2 binding. The present study provides a systematical understanding, from the energetic point of view, of the binding features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 acceptor. We hope that the present findings of three binding patches, key attracting residues and unexpected mutational sites can provide insights to the design of SARS-CoV-2 drugs and identification of cross-active antibodies.","output":"Quantitative Interpretations of Energetic Features and Key Residues at SARS Coronavirus Spike Receptor-Binding Domain and ACE2 Receptor Interface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Better understanding of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection might provide valuable insights into the future implementation of vaccination policies.

Young people aged 16C25 (n = 371, M = 21.1) from the general population in Australia completed an anonymous, cross-sectional online survey advertised on social media from June to October 2020. Participants reported high levels of psychological distress, with over 40% reporting severe levels of anxiety and depression, and those with a mental health diagnosis were more likely to perceive the pandemic to have had a negative impact on their mental health. Gender-diverse participants appeared the most negatively impacted. Social media use was high, with 96% reporting use at least once a day, and two-thirds reporting an increase in social media use since the start of the pandemic. One-third had used social media to seek support for suicidal thoughts or self-harm, and half had used it to support another person.

Social interaction affects both types of motivation equally. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are strong predictors of use intention, which in turn only moderately influences actual use, so follow-up studies should focus more on barriers to use. Multigroup analysis revealed that the relationships between coaching support and extrinsic as well as intrinsic motivation are significantly stronger formen than for women.

METHODS: We used a discrete choice experiment to assess preferences for SARS-CoV-2 test type, specimen type, testing venue, and results turnaround time. Participants (n=4793) from the US national longitudinal Communities, Households and SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING) COVID Cohort Study completed our online survey from July 30 to September 8, 2020. We estimated the relative importance of testing method attributes and part-worth utilities of attribute levels, and simulated the uptake of an optimized testing scenario relative to the current typical testing scenario of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) via nasopharyngeal swab in a provider's office or urgent care clinic with results in >5 days. RESULTS: Test result turnaround time had the highest relative importance (30.4%), followed by test type (28.3%), specimen type (26.2%), and venue (15.0%). In simulations, immediate or same-day test results, both PCR and serology, or oral specimens substantially increased testing uptake over the current typical testing option. Simulated uptake of a hypothetical testing scenario of PCR and serology via a saliva sample at a pharmacy with same-day results was 97.7%, compared to 0.6% for the current typical testing scenario, with 1.8% opting for no test.

Alternative methods to control the spread of the disease such as social isolation, extreme quarantine measures, and contact tracing have been used around the world. However, these measures may not be totally effective to fight COVID-19, in step with the necessary national preparations to meet the new patient care demands. A wide range of digital technologies can be used to enhance these public health strategies, and the pandemic has sparked increasing use of telehealth. This field has grown considerably in Brazil in recent years. Still, despite the intense proliferation of recommendations and rules, until the current pandemic the country still lacked a fully consolidated regulatory framework. The emergence of COVID-19 marks a key moment in the expansion of applications and use of telehealth for improving the health system's response to the current crisis. The article discusses telehealth's contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and the recent initiatives triggered in Brazil as opportunities for the consolidation of telemedicine and improvement of the Brazilian Unified National Health System.

Complications that can cause airway compromise occur infrequently, but can rapidly lead to respiratory arrest, leading to severe morbidity or death. Knowing emergent post-operative airway management including surgical airway placement is critical. We aim to review the different etiologies of post-operative airway compromise following ACSS, the predictable timeline in which they occur, and the most appropriate treatment and management for each. We place special emphasis on the timing and proper surgical technique for an emergent cricothyrotomy. Angioedema is seen the earliest as a cause of post-operative airway compromise, typically within 6-12 hours. Retropharyngeal hematomas can be seen between 6-24 hours, most commonly within 12 hours. Pharyngolaryngeal edema is seen within 24-72 hours. After 72 hours, retropharyngeal abscess is the most likely etiology. Several studies have utilized delayed extubation protocols following ACSS based on patient risk factors and found reduced postoperative airway complications and reintubation rates. The administration of perioperative corticosteroids continues to be controversial with high-level studies recommending both for and against their use. Animal studies showed that after cardiac arrest, the brain can recover if oxygenation is restored within 5 minutes, but this time is likely shorter with asphyxia prior to cardiac arrest. Experience and training are essential to reduce the time for successful cricothyrotomy placement. Physicians must be prepared to diagnose and treat acute postoperative airway complications following ACSS to prevent anoxic brain injury or death. If emergent intubation cannot be accomplished on the first attempt, physicians should not delay placement of a surgical airway such as cricothyrotomy.","output":"Acute post-operative airway complications following anterior cervical spine surgery and the role for cricothyrotomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"APOGEE spectra offer $\\\\lesssim$1 km s$^{-1}$ precision in the measurement of stellar radial velocities (RVs).

However, egg consumption may harm some people for its high contents of cholesterol and association with cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, we investigated the possible effect of using Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) as a probiotic additive in the laying hens diets on lowering egg-yolk cholesterol and also evaluated the immune responses and the productive performance of laying hens. The obtained results display the ability of LA, when supplemented in hen diets, to decrease the plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels and the liver and egg yolk cholesterols in the hen. The beneficial effects of LA were also explored on some important humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in the laying hens. These positive effects led to an improvement in the productive performance of laying hens. Therefore, dietary LA supplementation could be recommended as a nutritional strategy for commercial lower-cholesterol egg production in addition to positive impacts on the performance and health of laying hens. ABSTRACT: This study examines the effect of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) on the cholesterol levels, immune response, and productive performance of laying hens. A total of 216, 40-week-old, commercial Hy-Line brown chicken layers were randomly assigned into four treatment groups (18 birds  three replicates per group) and fed diet supplemented with 0 (control), 1  10(9), 21  10(9), and 31  10(9) colony forming units (CFUs) of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) per kg of feed for six consecutive weeks. Results show that plasma triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterols became lesser, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol became higher in LA-supplemented groups compared to the control. In addition, a significant reduction occurred in the liver and egg yolk cholesterol by LA supplementation. Moreover, the immunological parameters including antibody titer against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-wattle swelling test, and T- & B-lymphocyte proliferation were enhanced in laying hens supplemented with LA compared to the control hens. While the heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio decreased with LA supplementation, indicating low stress conditions in the treated hens. These positive effects for LA were further reflected on the productive performance of laying hens and improved egg production, egg weight, egg mass, and feed efficiency. Our findings indicate that LA probiotic could be recommended in laying hens diets for lowering egg yolk cholesterol with positive impacts on health and performance.","output":"Dietary Supplementation of Probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus Modulates Cholesterol Levels, Immune Response, and Productive Performance of Laying Hens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an escalating, highly infectious global pandemic that is quickly overwhelming healthcare systems.

Due to limited genomic and transcriptomic data, the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin, the major bioactive compound in G. uralensis, is currently unclear. Identification of candidate genes involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway will significantly contribute to the understanding of the biosynthetic and medicinal chemistry of this compound. RESULTS: We used the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium regents to produce a substantial expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset from the vegetative organs of G. uralensis. A total of 59,219 ESTs with an average read length of 409 bp were generated. 454 ESTs were combined with the 50,666 G. uralensis ESTs in GenBank. The combined ESTs were assembled into 27,229 unique sequences (11,694 contigs and 15,535 singletons). A total of 20,437 unique gene elements representing approximately 10,000 independent transcripts were annotated using BLAST searches (e-value  1e-5) against the SwissProt, KEGG, TAIR, Nr and Nt databases. The assembled sequences were annotated with gene names and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. With respect to the genes related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, genes encoding 16 enzymes of the 18 total steps of the glycyrrhizin skeleton synthesis pathway were found. To identify novel genes that encode cytochrome P450 enzymes and glycosyltransferases, which are related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, a total of 125 and 172 unigenes were found to be homologous to cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively. The cytochrome P450 candidate genes were classified into 32 CYP families, while the glycosyltransferase candidate genes were classified into 45 categories by GO analysis. Finally, 3 cytochrome P450 enzymes and 6 glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis through an organ-specific expression pattern analysis based on real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Using the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium reagents, our study provides a high-quality EST database for G. uralensis. Based on the EST analysis, novel candidate genes related to the secondary metabolite pathway of glycyrrhizin, including novel genes encoding cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, were found.

In particular, researchers and system operators (SOs) are now capable of simulating the complete network and of making it interact with the real world thanks to the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) and digital twin (DT) concepts. Such tools create infinite scenarios in which the network can be tested and virtually monitored to, for example, predict and avoid faults or energy shortages. Furthermore, the real-time monitoring of the network allows estimating the status of the electrical assets and consequently undertake their predictive maintenance. The success of the HIL and DT application relies on the fact that the simulated network elements (cables, generation, accessories, converters, etc.) are correctly modeled and characterized. This is particularly true if the RTS acquisition capabilities are used to enable the HIL and the DT. To this purpose, this work aims at emphasizing the role of a preliminary characterization of the virtual elements inside the RTS system, experimentally verifying how the overall performance is significantly affected by them. To this purpose, a virtual phasor measurement unit (PMU) is tested and characterized to understand its uncertainty contribution. To achieve that, firstly, the characterization of a virtual PMU calibrator is described. Afterward, the virtual PMU calibration is performed, and the results clearly highlight its key role in the overall uncertainty.

These viruses possess segmented, negative stranded RNA genomes (vRNA) and are enveloped, usually spherical and bud from the plasma membrane (more specifically, the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells). Complete virus particles, therefore, are not found inside infected cells. Virus particles consist of three major subviral components, namely the viral envelope, matrix protein (M1), and core (viral ribonucleocapsid [vRNP]). The viral envelope surrounding the vRNP consists of a lipid bilayer containing spikes composed of viral glycoproteins (HA, NA, and M2) on the outer side and M1 on the inner side. Viral lipids, derived from the host plasma membrane, are selectively enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. M1 forms the bridge between the viral envelope and the core. The viral core consists of helical vRNP containing vRNA (minus strand) and NP along with minor amounts of NEP and polymerase complex (PA, PB1, and PB2). For viral morphogenesis to occur, all three viral components, namely the viral envelope (containing lipids and transmembrane proteins), M1, and the vRNP must be brought to the assembly site, i.e. the apical plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells. Finally, buds must be formed at the assembly site and virus particles released with the closure of buds. Transmembrane viral proteins are transported to the assembly site on the plasma membrane via the exocytic pathway. Both HA and NA possess apical sorting signals and use lipid rafts for cell surface transport and apical sorting. These lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and are relatively resistant to neutral detergent extraction at low temperature. M1 is synthesized on free cytosolic polyribosomes. vRNPs are made inside the host nucleus and are exported into the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore with the help of M1 and NEP. How M1 and vRNPs are directed to the assembly site on the plasma membrane remains unclear. The likely possibilities are that they use a piggy-back mechanism on viral glycoproteins or cytoskeletal elements. Alternatively, they may possess apical determinants or diffuse to the assembly site, or a combination of these pathways. Interactions of M1 with M1, M1 with vRNP, and M1 with HA and NA facilitate concentration of viral components and exclusion of host proteins from the budding site. M1 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail (CT) and transmembrane domain (TMD) of glycoproteins, and thereby functions as a bridge between the viral envelope and vRNP. Lipid rafts function as microdomains for concentrating viral glycoproteins and may serve as a platform for virus budding. Virus bud formation requires membrane bending at the budding site. A combination of factors including concentration of and interaction among viral components, increased viscosity and asymmetry of the lipid bilayer of the lipid raft as well as pulling and pushing forces of viral and host components are likely to cause outward curvature of the plasma membrane at the assembly site leading to bud formation. Eventually, virus release requires completion of the bud due to fusion of the apposing membranes, leading to the closure of the bud, separation of the virus particle from the host plasma membrane and release of the virus particle into the extracellular environment. Among the viral components, M1 contains an L domain motif and plays a critical role in budding. Bud completion requires not only viral components but also host components. However, how host components facilitate bud completion remains unclear. In addition to bud completion, influenza virus requires NA to release virus particles from sialic acid residues on the cell surface and spread from cell to cell. Elucidation of both viral and host factors involved in viral morphogenesis and budding may lead to the development of drugs interfering with the steps of viral morphogenesis and in disease progression.","output":"Assembly and budding of influenza virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging outbreaks of airborne pathogenic infections worldwide, such as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, have raised the need to understand parameters affecting the airborne survival of microbes in order to develop measures for effective infection control We report a novel experimental strategy, TAMBAS (Tandem Approach for Microphysical and Biological Assessment of Airborne Microorganisms Survival), to explore the synergistic interactions between the physicochemical and biological processes that impact airborne microbe survival in aerosol droplets This innovative approach provides a unique and detailed understanding of the processes taking place from aerosol droplet generation through to equilibration and viability decay in the local environment, elucidating decay mechanisms not previously described The impact of evaporation kinetics, solute hygroscopicity and concentration, particle morphology and equilibrium particle size on airborne survival are reported, using Escherichia coli (MRE162) as a benchmark system For this system, we report that the particle crystallisation does not directly impact microbe longevity, bacteria act as crystallization nuclei during droplet drying and equilibration, and the kinetics of size and compositional change appear to have a larger effect on microbe longevity than equilibrium solute concentration IMPORTANCE A transformative approach to identify the physicochemical processes that impact the biological decay rates of bacteria in aerosol droplets is described It is shown that the evaporation process and changes in the phase and morphology of the aerosol particle during evaporation impact microorganism viability The equilibrium droplet size was found to affect airborne bacterial viability Furthermore, the presence of Escherichia coli (MRE162) in a droplet does not affect aerosol growth/evaporation, but influences the dynamic behaviour of the aerosol through processing the culture media prior to aerosolization affecting the hygroscopicity of the culture medium;this highlights the importance of the inorganic and organic chemical composition within the aerosolised droplets that impact hygroscopicity Bacteria act also as a crystallisation nucleus The novel approach and data has implications for increased mechanistic understanding of aerosol survival and infectivity in bioaerosol studies spanning medical, veterinary, farming, and agricultural fields, including the role of micro-organisms in atmospheric processing and cloud formation","output":"Transformative Approach to Investigate the Microphysical Factors Influencing the Airborne Transmission of Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & objectives : In the context of India's ongoing resurgence of COVID-19 (second wave since mid-February 2021, following the subsiding of the first wave in September 2020), there has been increasing speculation on the possibility of a future third wave of infection, posing a burden on the healthcare system. Using simple mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, this study examined the conditions under which a serious third wave could occur. Methods : Using a deterministic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, four potential mechanisms for a third wave were examined: (i) waning immunity restores previously exposed individuals to a susceptible state, (ii) emergence of a new viral variant that is capable of escaping immunity to previously circulating strains, (iii) emergence of a new viral variant that is more transmissible than the previously circulating strains, and (iv) release of current lockdowns affording fresh opportunities for transmission. Results : Immune-mediated mechanisms (waning immunity, or viral evolution for immune escape) are unlikely to drive a severe third wave if acting on their own, unless such mechanisms lead to a complete loss of protection among those previously exposed. Likewise, a new, more transmissible variant would have to exceed a high threshold (R0>4.5) to cause a third wave on its own. However, plausible mechanisms for a third wave include: (i) a new variant that is more transmissible and at the same time capable of escaping prior immunity, and (ii) lockdowns that are highly effective in limiting transmission and subsequently released. In both cases, any third wave seems unlikely to be as severe as the second wave. Rapid scale-up of vaccination efforts could play an important role in mitigating these and future waves of the disease. Interpretation & conclusions : This study demonstrates plausible mechanisms by which a substantial third wave could occur, while also illustrating that it is unlikely for any such resurgence to be as large as the second wave. Model projections are, however, subject to several uncertainties, and it remains important to scale up vaccination coverage to mitigate against any eventuality. Preparedness planning for any potential future wave will benefit by drawing upon the projected numbers based on the present modelling exercise.","output":"Plausibility of a third wave of COVID-19 in India: A mathematical modelling based analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Everybody likes to make a good prediction, in particular, when some sort of personal investment is involved in terms of finance, energy or time The difficulty is to make a prediction that optimises the reward obtained from the original contribution;this is even more important when investments are the core service offered by a business or pension fund generated by monthly contributions The complexity of finance is that the human predictor may have other interests or bias than the human investor, the trust between predictor and investor will never be completely established as the investor will never know if the predictor has generated, intentionally or unintentionally, the optimum possible reward This paper presents the Random Neural Network in recurrent configuration that makes predictions on time series data, specifically, prices The biological model inspired by the brain structure and neural interconnections makes predictions entirely on previous data from the time series rather than predictions based on several uncorrelated inputs The model is validated against the property, stock and Fintech market: 1) UK property prices, 2) stock markets indice prices, 3) cryptocurrency prices Experimental results show that the proposed method makes accurate predictions on different investment portfolios","output":"The random neural network in price predictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the organisation of health care in Italy, with an acceleration in the development of telemedicine. To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the spread of remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) in Italy, a survey addressed to cardiologists operating in all Italian CIED-implanting centres was launched. A total of 127 cardiologists from 116 Italian arrhythmia centres took part in the survey, 41.0% of all 283 CIED-implanting centres operating in Italy in 2019.

Roughly half of all opioids are prescribed in primary care. Although clinical guidelines describe recommended opioid prescribing practices, implementing these guidelines in a way that balances safety and effectiveness vs. risk remains a challenge. The literature offers little help about which implementation strategies work best in different clinical settings or how strategies could be tailored to optimize their effectiveness in different contexts. Systems consultation consists of (1) educational/engagement meetings with audit and feedback reports, (2) practice facilitation, and (3) prescriber peer consulting. The study is designed to discover the most cost-effective sequence and combination of strategies for improving opioid prescribing practices in diverse primary care clinics. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a hybrid type 3 clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) that randomizes clinics from two health systems at two points, months 3 and 9, of a 21-month intervention. Clinics are provided one of four sequences of implementation strategies: a condition consisting of educational/engagement meetings and audit and feedback alone (EM/AF), EM/AF plus practice facilitation (PF), EM/AF + prescriber peer consulting (PPC), and EM/AF + PF + PPC. The study's primary outcome is morphine-milligram equivalent (MME) dose by prescribing clinicians within clinics. The study's primary aim is the comparison of EM/AF + PF + PPC versus EM/AF alone on change in MME from month 3 to month 21. The secondary aim is to derive cost estimates for each of the four sequences and compare them. The exploratory aim is to examine four tailoring variables that can be used to construct an adaptive implementation strategy to meet the needs of different primary care clinics. DISCUSSION: Systems consultation is a practical blend of implementation strategies used in this case to improve opioid prescribing practices in primary care. The blend offers a range of strategies in sequences from minimally to substantially intensive. The results of this study promise to help us understand how to cost effectively improve the implementation of evidence-based practices. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04044521 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

We aimed to assess the challenges confronting adult people living with HIV (PLHIV) in three countries in North Africa during the COVID-19 crisis and their awareness of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical preventive measures. METHODS: This online survey included PLHIV aged 18 y from three countries in North Africa recruited by a snowball sampling technique, who were asked to complete a modified questionnaire originally developed by the University of Antwerp in Belgium, which was then disseminated through social media tools to assess the study outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 369 respondents, 260 (70.5%) were males and 237 (64.2%) were aged 18-39 y. Adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, wearing facemasks (308 [83.2%]), applying hand-sanitizers (299 [80.8%]) and following cough etiquette (261 [70.5%]), were predominantly reported. Only 48 (13%) were vaccinated against influenza. One hundred and forty-five participants (42%) experienced flu-like symptoms, 29 (20%) were tested for COVID-19, with only one confirmed case identified.

The devastating Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak of 2014C2015 in West Africa impacted significantly on all sectors of the healthcare systems in the MRU countries, including the TB prevention and control programmes. The EVD outbreak also had an adverse impact on the healthcare workforce and healthcare service delivery. At the height of the EVD outbreak, numerous staff members in all MRU countries contracted EBV at the Ebola treatment units and died. Many healthcare workers were also infected in healthcare facilities that were not Ebola treatment units but were national hospitals and peripheral health units that were unprepared for receiving patients with EVD. In all three MRU countries, the disruption to TB services due to the EVD epidemic will no doubt have increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, TB morbidity and mortality, and decreased patient adherence to TB treatment, and the likely impact will not be known for several years to come. In this viewpoint, the impact that the EVD outbreak had on TB diagnostic, management, and prevention services is described. Vaccination against TB with BCG in children under 5 years of age was affected adversely by the EVD epidemic. The EVD outbreak was a result of global failure and represents yet another wake-up call to the international community, and particularly to African governments, to reach a consensus on new ways of thinking at the national, regional, and global levels for building healthcare systems that can sustain their function during outbreaks.

Agriculture-specific COVID-19 resources were developed and disseminated, and a farmer/employer survey was launched. RESULTS: The WCAHS COVID-19 resources web page, worksite checklist, and training guide were shared on over 50 web pages nationally. As of June 30, 2020, 282 online surveys have been received. Ongoing informal discussions with agricultural stakeholders indicate a disconnect between the experiences of farmers/employers and farmworkers in relation to COVID-19 prevention at the worksite. Initial survey responses indicate that implementing social distancing is one of the greatest challenges at the worksite. Confusion over local, state, and federal guidelines and which to follow is another concern. CONCLUSION: The WCAHS response to COVID-19, in close collaboration with agricultural stakeholders, represents a useful model for a rapid response to a public health crisis by regional centers. Key elements to its success include rapid personalized communication with a wide range of agricultural stakeholders, an actively engaged External Advisory Board, the development of industry-specific resources and information, recurring and iterative engagement with stakeholders as new COVID-19 information emerged and resources were developed, and the identification of the unique gap WCAHS was positioned to fill.

In addition, visibility in a newspaper article is an important component of representation in academia. Objective: We sought to determine whether women were underrepresented as COVID-19 expert sources in print newspapers in the United States. Design: We undertook a cross-sectional study of English-language newspaper articles that addressed the COVID-19 pandemic that were published in the top ten most widely read newspapers in the United States between Apr 1 and Apr 15, 2020. Main Measures: We extracted the names of all people cited as expert sources and categorized each expert sources as men, women, or another gender based on pronoun usage within the article or on a business, university, or organization website. Key Results: Of 2,297 expert sources identified, 35.9% (95% CI 33.9-37.8%;n=824) were women, 63.7% were men (95% CI 61.8-65.7%;n=1,464) and for 0.4%, gender could not be assigned (n=9).

We propose that ALI presents as a multidimensional entity characterized by four domains that reflect the key pathophysiologic features and underlying biology of human acute respiratory distress syndrome.

We propose that experimental ALI encompasses a continuum of models ranging from those focusing on gaining specific mechanistic insights to those primarily concerned with preclinical testing of novel therapeutics or interventions. We suggest that mechanistic studies may justifiably focus on a single domain of lung injury, but models must document alterations of at least three of the four domains to qualify as experimental ALI. Finally, we propose that a time criterion defining acute in ALI remains relevant, but the actual time may vary based on the specific model and the aspect of injury being modeled.

The current pandemic leads to increased parental stress, a risk factor for harsh parenting behavior, Therefore, we aimed to assess the role of ACEs and sociodemographic factors associated to parental coping during the current pandemic. In a cross-sectional online survey, 687 parents of minors in Germany were included. Demographic and psychosocial factors associated to parental coping during the first lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic were assessed. Results show that younger age of the respective child, income loss, dissatisfaction with the sharing of childcare duties, and ACEs were significantly associated with an increase of potential harmful parenting behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic. An increase of dissatisfaction with the sharing of childcare duties during the pandemic was predicted by working from home and taking care of the children mainly by oneself, while sharing childcare duties with the partner equally resulted even in an increase of satisfaction with sharing of childcare duties during the pandemic.

Without a clear symptom pattern to narrow the focus of a diagnostic workup, this task can require numerous noninvasive and invasive procedures, imaging studies, and laboratory tests to arrive at a conclusion. Identifying the source of a patients fever in the setting of an acute spinal cord injury can present a unique challenge because this population is at risk for many different conditions that can cause fever, some of which are rarely seen in the general population. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes a unique case and diagnostic workup of fever of unknown origin in a 51-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities who presented to an inpatient rehabilitation service following an acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury. Ultimately, it was determined that the patient had several different factors that were causing him to have intermittent fevers over a 5-week period. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates the importance of obtaining serial medical histories and physical examinations during the investigation for fever of unknown origin. It also supports why additional workup of a patients fever may need to be considered even after a potential source is found. Finally, it demonstrates the need for increased awareness of quadriplegic fever so that this condition can be more effectively recognized, prevented, and managed in the future.","output":"An approach to the management of fever of unknown origin in the setting of acute spinal cord injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a means of cardiopulmonary support for refractory respiratory and cardiac failure.

The effects of the KOR agonist U50,488 and the KOR antagonist aticaprant were assessed on nest building behavior, an ethologically relevant indicator of overall well-being and affect, in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice. Females required a higher dose of U50,488 to suppress nesting, and a higher dose of aticaprant to restore U50,488-induced impairment of nesting. Females also required a higher dose of aticaprant to decrease immobility scores in the forced swim test. Pretreatment with the estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen at a dose which blocked estrogen receptors, augmented the effect of U50,488 on nesting in female mice, suggesting that estrogen receptors play a key role in attenuating the effects of KOR ligands in female mice. Together, these results suggest that females are less sensitive to KOR mediation, requiring a higher dose to achieve comparable results to males. This behavioral sensitivity, as measured by nesting, may be mediated by estrogen receptors.

The aim was to demonstrate the benefit of adding Lyso-GL-3 to primary diagnostic screening to avoid unnecessary genetic testing. The results have shown that determination of the enzyme activity combined with the concentration of Lyso-GL-3 (Lyso-Gb3) in Dried Blood Spots (DBS), substantially improved the diagnostic detection of FD in females compared to using enzyme activity alone.

Due to the high infectivity and pathogenicity of this virus, all studies on the live virus are strictly confined in the biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory but this would hinder the basic research and antiviral drug development of SARS-CoV-2 because the BSL3 facility is not commonly available and the work in the containment is costly and laborious. In this study, we constructed a reverse genetics system of SARS-CoV-2 by assembling the viral cDNA in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector with deletion of the spike (S) gene. Transfection of the cDNA into cells results in the production of an RNA replicon that keeps the capability of genome or subgenome replication but is deficient in virion assembly and infection due to the absence of S protein. Therefore, such a replicon system is not infectious and can be used in ordinary biological laboratories. We confirmed the efficient replication of the replicon by demonstrating the expression of the subgenomic RNAs which have similar profiles to the wild-type virus. By mutational analysis of nsp12 and nsp14, we showed that the RNA polymerase, exonuclease, and cap N7 methyltransferase play essential roles in genome replication and sgRNA production. We also created a SARS-CoV-2 replicon carrying a luciferase reporter gene and this system was validated by the inhibition assays with known anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Thus, such a one-plasmid system is biosafe and convenient to use, which will benefit both fundamental research and development of antiviral drugs.

However, most of these have never been tested under real quarantine situations or derive from older investigations conducted mostly in China and Canada in the face of infections other than COVID-19. The present study aimed at exploring the relationship between a comprehensive set of recommended lifestyles, socio-demographic, and personality variables and mood during the first stages of quarantine. Methods: A virtual snow-ball recollection technique was used to disseminate the survey across the general population in Spain starting the first day of mandatory quarantine (15 March 2020) until three days later (17 March). In total, 2683 Spanish adults (mean age = 34.86 years, SD = 13.74 years; 77.7% women) from the general population completed measures on socio-demographic, COVID-related, behavioral, personality/cognitive, and mood characteristics. Results: In the present study, depression and anger were higher than levels reported in a previous investigation before the COVID-19 crisis, while vigor, friendliness, and fatigue were lower. Anxiety levels were comparable. The expected direction of associations was confirmed for the majority of predictors. However, effect sizes were generally small and only a subset of them correlated to most outcomes. Intolerance of unpleasant emotions, neuroticism, and, to a lesser extent, agreeableness, sleep quality, young age, and time spent Internet surfing were the most robust and strongest correlates of mood states. Conclusions: Some recommended lifestyles (i.e., maintaining good quality of sleep and reducing Internet surfing) might be more important than others during the first days of quarantine. Promoting tolerance to unpleasant emotions (e.g., through online, self-managed programs) might also be of upmost importance. So far, recommendations have been made in general, but certain subgroups (e.g., certain personality profiles and young adults) might be especially vulnerable and should receive more attention.","output":"How Much Support Is There for the Recommendations Made to the General Population during Confinement?

Loneliness and obesity independently have been found to be risk factors for negative physical and mental health outcomes. This study examined the rates and interrelationships of loneliness, body mass index (BMI), and health care utilization in a primary care setting. Methods A cross-sectional survey of adult patients presenting for outpatient care at 7 family medicine clinical practices in Pennsylvania was conducted. Survey questions included self-reported measures of loneliness, height/weight, number of health care visits, and potential confounders (eg, sociodemographic variables, health status). Bivariate and multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze associations among loneliness, BMI, and health care utilization. Results In all, 464 eligible patients returned surveys for an overall response rate of 26%. Mean (standard deviation) loneliness score was 4.2 (1.7), mean BMI was 30.4 (7.6), and mean number of visits in year prior was 2.7 (3.6). On bivariate analysis, BMI was positively associated with loneliness (effect estimate: 0.50; P=0.03). On multivariable analysis, BMI was negatively associated with attending religious services and self-reported physical health and positively associated with self-reported mental health (P<0.05 for all), but not associated with loneliness. While not associated with loneliness, health care utilization was negatively associated with Hispanic ethnicity, marital status, and self-reported physical health (P<0.05 for all). Conclusions Given the detrimental effects loneliness and obesity have on health outcomes, it might be prudent for health care providers to prioritize health concerns for their patients by assessing loneliness and counseling regarding associated risks, particularly in patients with obesity.","output":"Loneliness in Primary Care Patients: Relationships With Body Mass Index and Health Care Utilization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) morbidity is rising in Uganda However, data are limited about people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices Objective To determine knowledge about COVID-19, attitudes towards presidential directives and Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines, and adherence to practicing public health preventive measures (KAP) in Uganda Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 28 and May 19, 2020 Data were collected using online social media platforms, websites, and popular media outlets We descriptively summarized data and categorized KAP scores as knowledgeable about COVID-19, positive attitude towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines, and adherent to public health preventive measures, respectively We tested sex differences in KAP using tests of significance and established independently associated factors using modified Poisson regression analysis, reported using adjusted prevalence risk ratio (aPR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) Results We studied 362 participants with the following sociodemographic characteristics: 86 (23 8%) aged 25-29 years, 212 (58 6%) males, 270 (74 6%) with tertiary or university levels of education, and 268 (74 0%) urban residents Of the 362 participants, 264 (93 9%) were knowledgeable about COVID-19 (94 1% males and 93 8% females), 51 3% had positive attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines (51 0% male and 51 8% female), and 175 (48 3%) were adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (42 9% males and 56 0% females) Compared to males, our data shows that females were more adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (aPR, 1 23;95% CI, 1 01-1 53), knowledgeable about COVID-19 (aPR, 1 01;95% CI, 0 95-1 07), and had positive attitudes towards directives and guidelines (aPR, 1 01;95% CI, 0 82-1 25) Conclusions This study shows that public health prevention efforts should be directed to closing the identified gaps in KAP among Ugandans in order to halt the spread of COVD-19 in Uganda as well as the East African region [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of BioMed Research International is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Findings of a Cross-Sectional Survey on Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices about COVID-19 in Uganda: Implications for Public Health Prevention and Control Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using a stochastic model, we assess the risk of importation-induced local transmission chains in locations seeing few or no local transmissions and evaluate the role of quarantine in the mitigation of this risk.

The latter influences the severity of the outbreaks when they do take place. Quarantine after arrival in a location is an efficacious way to reduce the rate of importations.

METHODS: Systematic search of literature was conducted in Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. Google Scholar and Grey literature including conference proceedings were also checked. Published articles from November 1, 2012 until May 18, 2020 were searched. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were also conducted to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: We found 38 articles with 19,428 individuals met the eligibility criteria. Of these papers, 35 studies were included in meta-analysis. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was estimated to be about 18% (95%CI: 15% to 20%). These symptoms were more frequent in cohort studies (29%) compared to cross-sectional (15%) and case-control (11%) studies. Prevalence rates of PTSD symptoms in MERS (36%) outbreaks were higher than SARS (18%) and COVID-19 (9%) outbreaks. Meta-regression showed that the geographical location of study was the source of heterogeneity (R2: 19.8%, P-value: 0.003). Meta-analysis reported that about three in every ten survivors of coronavirus infection, about two in every ten healthcare workers, and about one in every ten individuals of general population experienced PTSD symptoms in outbreaks.

Countries that have been severely hit by the pandemic are using pharmacists to help triage patients. In order to ensure the continuity of these services, it is of paramount importance that pharmacists be formally involved and engaged in the management of this pandemic. In response to the underlying knowledge deficit, this study was undertaken as the first of its kind in the entirety of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This study is a questionnaire based cross-sectional study that was carried out for a period of five months from March 2020 to July 2020 to assess the role of working pharmacists in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic under different health care settings across Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 398 responses were recorded, in which 51.1% of the respondents were not involved in any learning or awareness activities involving health care providers (HCPs) or patients. The majority of respondents (62.9%) were not involved in creating or evaluating therapeutic plans for COVID19 patients, and 55% were not involved in therapeutic mentoring of COVID19 patients. Only a very low percentage of respondents were participating in COVID19-related research within their institution. Only 37% of respondents reported being satisfied with their role and contribution in the management of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The present study reveals that pharmacists are underutilized in the management of COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia. As such, the findings emphasize the importance of enhancing the role and contribution of pharmacists in patient care management across all hospitals and especially under health care crisis conditions. The establishment of a crisis standard of care guideline for all HCPs, including pharmacists, would help in improving patient overall care under crisis conditions like the present COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Pharmacists satisfaction with their involvement in the management of COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and the fourth most lethal cancer in China. However, although genomic studies have identified some mutations associated with ESCC, we know little of the mutational processes responsible. To identify genome-wide mutational signatures, we performed either whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 104 ESCC individuals and combined our data with those of 88 previously reported samples. An APOBEC-mediated mutational signature in 47% of 192 tumors suggests that APOBEC-catalyzed deamination provides a source of DNA damage in ESCC. Moreover, PIK3CA hotspot mutations (c.1624G>A [p.Glu542Lys] and c.1633G>A [p.Glu545Lys]) were enriched in APOBEC-signature tumors, and no smoking-associated signature was observed in ESCC. In the samples analyzed by WGS, we identified focal (<100 kb) amplifications of CBX4 and CBX8. In our combined cohort, we identified frequent inactivating mutations in AJUBA, ZNF750, and PTCH1 and the chromatin-remodeling genes CREBBP and BAP1, in addition to known mutations. Functional analyses suggest roles for several genes (CBX4, CBX8, AJUBA, and ZNF750) in ESCC. Notably, high activity of hedgehog signaling and the PI3K pathway in approximately 60% of 104 ESCC tumors indicates that therapies targeting these pathways might be particularly promising strategies for ESCC.

Low social support is a key risk factor for developing PND. From an evolutionary perspective this is perhaps unsurprising, as humans evolved as cooperative childrearers, inherently reliant on social support to raise children. The coronavirus pandemic has created a situation in which support from social networks beyond the nuclear family is likely to be even more important to new mothers, as it poses risks and stresses for mothers to contend with;whilst at the same time, social distancing measures designed to limit transmission create unprecedented alterations to their access to such support.

Levels of depressive symptoms, as assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were high, with 47.5% of the participants meeting a &gt;=11 cut-off for PND. Quasi-Poisson regression modelling found that the number of network members seen in-person, and remote communication with a higher proportion of those not seen, was negatively associated with depressive symptoms;however, contact with a higher proportion of relatives was positively associated with symptoms, suggesting kin risked seeing mothers in need. Thematic qualitative analysis of open text responses found that mothers experienced a burden of constant mothering, inadequacy of virtual contact, and sadness and worries about lost social opportunities, while support from partners facilitated family bonding.

Coinfection with multiple respiratory viruses is common. Although the effects of each virus have been studied individually, the effects of coinfection on disease severity or healthcare seeking are less well-understood. METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of a maternal influenza vaccine trial conducted between 2011 and 2014 in rural southern Nepal. Prospective weekly active household-based surveillance of infants was conducted from birth to 180 days of age. Mid-nasal swabs were collected and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, parainfluenza (HPIV), and bocavirus by RTCPCR. Coinfection was defined as the presence of two or more respiratory viruses simultaneously detected as part of the same illness episode. Maternal vaccination status, infant age, prematurity, and number of children under 5 in the household were adjusted for with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1,730 infants with a respiratory illness, 327 (19%) had at least two respiratory viruses detected on their primary illness episode. Coinfection status did not differ by maternal vaccination status, infant age, premature birth, and number of children under 5 in the household. Of 113 infants with influenza, 23 (20%) had coinfection. Of 214 infants with RSV, 87 (41%) had coinfection. Overall, infants with coinfection had increased occurrence of fever lasting 4 or more days overall (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0), and in the subset of infants with influenza (OR 5.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 18.7). Coinfection was not associated with seeking further care (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.5) or pneumonia (OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of infants experiencing their first respiratory illness had multiple viruses detected. Coinfection with influenza was associated with longer duration of fever compared with children with influenza alone, but was not associated with increased illness severity by other measures.

In Ireland, implementation has been slow for multiple reasons. Our unit aimed to introduce day case tonsillectomy, following a pilot programme. Following a year of implementation we have reaudited our practice. We hypothesised that day case tonsillectomy is a practical and favourable solution to facilitate access to surgery in the context of long waiting times for ENT surgery. Methods This was a prospective audit collecting data on day case tonsillectomy. All patients for day case tonsillectomy were selected in OPD according to our inclusion criteria. We recorded demographical data, surgical technique, length of stay, failed discharges, bleeding rate and readmission rate. Results There was one primary haemorrhage within 24 hours of surgery (0.08%). There were 16 secondary bleeds, giving a rate of 13.9%. Of these, four patients required a return to theatre for the cessation of bleeding (3.5%). There was no statistical significance in bleed rate between surgical technique. Failed discharge rate was 6%. The average time from extubation to discharge was 6 hours and 53 minutes. Conclusions Our experience of day case tonsillectomy is that it is safe, feasible and efficient in a selected group of patients.

The aim of this study was to survey Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students' perceptions of learning during the instructional shift as well as assess the impact of this shift on learning outcomes. SUBJECTS: One hundred twenty-five students enrolled in the DPT program were recruited to participate in this study. METHODS: A survey was completed by students 12 days after the switch to remote instruction. Students rated multiple aspects of remote instruction. In addition, exam scores of students before and after the shift to remote instruction were compared, and final semester grades were compared to previous years. RESULTS. Most respondents reported that they did not learn as well during remote instruction (83%);however, students' exam scores during remote instruction indicated otherwise. Openended questions revealed varied student responses regarding remote learning, workload, and burnout. CONCLUSION: A disconnect seems to exist between student perceptions of learning with actual learning outcomes. While these results may positively support remote instruction, qualitative data indicate that student experience of remote instruction must be considered to avoid burnout and stress among students.

Participants reported detailed information on their physical activity habits using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and wore actigraphs continuously for 7 days (168 h). The actigraph data were then transferred to four rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters: midline statistic of rhythm (MESOR), amplitude, acrophase and percent rhythm. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate the association of period effect of COVID-19 on physical activity and rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters. RESULTS: Among the 242 community older men, 106 (43.8%) of them were recruited before the COVID-19 outbreak, 66 (27.3%) were recruited between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19, and 70 (28.9%) were recruited during the late phase of the 3rd wave of COVID-19. Compared with those recruited before COVID-19, participants recruited between the 2nd and 3rd waves of COVID-19 had lower physical activity (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.03, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) =1.05-3.93), MESOR (AOR = 2.05, 95%CI = 1.01-4.18), and amplitude (AOR = 1.91, 95%CI = 0.95-3.83).

PARTICIPANTS: 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone). INTERVENTIONS: Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone. RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease. The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days. A total of 109 (73%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus. The probability of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the standard of care group (81.3%, 71.2% to 89.6%).

In this group of society, life satisfaction is particularly associated with the emotional area. The notion of life satisfaction is related to many factors, such as personality traits, moods and various life events, and poses challenges in various aspects of everyday life. Given that mental health is one of the determinants of the quality of life of older adults, it is reasonable to conduct research among this growing group of the population. The aim of this study was to assess life satisfaction and depressive symptoms in mentally active older adults in Poland. METHODS The study covered 125 attendees at the University of Healthy Senior (UHS) and 125 auditing students at the University of Psychogeriatric Prophylaxis (UPP), organised by the Faculty of Health Sciences at the Medical University of Bialystok, of whom 78.3% were female and 21.7% male. The study was conducted using four standardised scales: the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Beck Depression Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS Seniors who participated in the study were satisfied with their lives; the average SWLS score was 23 points. Men rated their level of satisfaction higher than women: the median score on the SWLS was 26 points for men and 23 points for women. Life satisfaction and mental disorders did not differ on the basis of sex, age, or education (the type of place of education attended). As the level of depression increased, life satisfaction decreased. Statistically significant correlations of average strength were found between the point values of the four measures of depression under consideration and were evenly distributed from 0.57 to 0.69. CONCLUSIONS The high level of life satisfaction and a low level of mental disorders should be maintained in this population, and additional educational activities should be organised among seniors on a large scale. There were no differences in the distribution of psychometric measure scores among the three compared age groups of respondents in this study.

We conducted this study to understand the attitudes of neurologists in private practice regarding the use of telemedicine in epileptology and resulting barriers. At the same time, we present possible solutions. METHODS: Using an individually designed 14-item questionnaire, we prospectively surveyed all neurologists who had previously not responded or had declined participation in a transregional telemedicine pilot project regarding perceived barriers to the use of telemedicine. RESULTS: Of 58 contacted neurologists, 33 (57%) responded. The most common reasons for not using telemedicine were a perceived lack of time or a suspected excessive organizational burden (49%), concerns about technical equipment (30%), and a preference for alternative ways of intersectoral communication (30%). Feared problems related to reimbursement for telemedicine services were an obstacle for 27%. Neurologists in rural areas were significantly more willing to first request a telemedicine consultation before making a referral (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The widespread establishment of telemedicine is still hindered by obstacles, most of which are organizational. The existing healthcare challenges in rural areas are a particular opportunity for the implementation of telemedicine. Most barriers to telemedicine can be solved but should be considered from the onset when designing pilot projects in order to facilitate their continuation.","output":"Einstellungen und Hinderungsgrnde bezglich Telemedizin bei Epilepsien: Eine Umfrage in neurologischen Praxen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Correctional services, both institutional and within the community, are impacted by COVID-19 In the current paper, we focus on the current situation and examine the tensions around how COVID-19 has introduced new challenges while also exacerbating strains on the correctional system Here, we make recommendations that are directly aimed at how correctional systems manage COVID-19 and address the nature and structure of correctional systems that should be continued after the pandemic In addition, we highlight and make recommendations for the needs of those who remain incarcerated in general, and for Indigenous people in particular, as well as for those who are serving their sentences in the community Further, we make recommendations for those working in closed-custody institutions and employed to support the re-entry experiences of formerly incarcerated persons We are at a critical juncturewhere reflection and change are possibleand we put forth recommendations toward supporting those working and living in correctional services as a way forward during the pandemic and beyond Copyright: ? 2021 Ricciardelli et al","output":"Correctional services during and beyond COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 developed global-pandemic with millions of infections/deaths. As it is urgently necessary it is assumed that some blockers/inhibitors of ACE2 could be helpful to resist the binding of viral-spike Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD). METHODS: Here, conserved RBD from 186-countries were compared with WUHAN-Hu-1 wild-type (CLUSTAL-X2/Pymol). The RBD of ACE2-bound nCOV2 crystal-structure 6VW1 was analyzed by Haddock-PatchDock. Extensive structural study/trial to introduce point/double/triple mutations in the different locations of CUT4 (most-effective from total 4 proposed fragments; CUTs) were tested with Swiss-Model-Expacy. RESULTS: Blind-docking of mutated-CUTs in ACE2 completely rejected the nCOV2 binding to ACE2. Further, competitive-docking/binding-analyses (by PRODIGY) demonstrated few more bonding (LYS31-PHE490 and GLN42-GLN498) of CUT4 (than wild) and hindered TYR41-THR500 interaction with ACE2. Moreover, mutated-CUT4 even showed higher blocking effect against spike-ACE2 binding. CONCLUSION: In summary, CUT4-mutant rejects whole glycosylated-nCoV2 in all pre-dock, post-dock and competitive-docking conditions.

Nucleic acid amplification testing or gene sequencing can serve as pathogenic evidence of COVID-19 diagnosing for clinically suspected cases, and dynamic monitoring of specific antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG) is an effective complement for false-negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Antigen tests to identify SARS-CoV-2 are recommended in the first week of infection, which is associated with high viral loads. Additionally, many clinical laboratory indicators are abnormal as the disease evolves. For example, from moderate to severe and critical cases, leukocytes, neutrophils, and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio increase; conversely, lymphocytes decrease progressively but are over activated. LDH, AST, ALT, CK, high-sensitivity troponin I, and urea also increase progressively, and increased D-dimer is an indicator of severe disease and an independent risk factor for death. Severe infection leads to aggravation of inflammation. Inflammatory biomarkers and cytokines, such as CRP, SAA, ferritin, IL-6, and TNF-&#945;, increase gradually. High-risk COVID-19 patients with severe disease, such as the elderly and those with underlying diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, obesity, and cancer), should be monitored dynamically, which will be helpful as an early warning of serious diseases.","output":"Clinical laboratory evaluation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spurred a global health crisis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was designed to address blood supply, transfusion demand, and donor management during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Medical directors of different blood banks were invited to participate. RESULTS: A total of 16 centers participated with representation from 15/22 countries in the region. 75% were from national blood banks. Most centres had a decrease in the blood supply, ranging from 26-50%. Representatives from 14 countries (93.3%) believed that public fear has contributed to a decrease in donations. Most centres (n=12, 87.5%) had a reduction in transfusion demand, while those who did not, reported heavy involvement in treating patients with underlying haemoglobinopathies and haematological malignancies. Half of the centres activated their contingency plans. Four centres had to alter the blood donor eligibility criteria to meet demands. All centres implemented donor deferral criteria in relation to SARS-CoV-2, but were variable in measures to mitigate the risk of donor and staff exposure.

Mobile Health (mHealth) and, most prominently, ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) provide a unique opportunity to deliver youth-friendly, personalized, real-time, guided self-help interventions. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a novel, accessible, transdiagnostic ecological momentary intervention for improving self-esteem (SELFIE) in youth with prior exposure to childhood adversity. METHODS/DESIGN: In a parallel-group, assessor-blind, multi-center randomized controlled trial, individuals aged 12C26 years with prior exposure to childhood adversity and low self-esteem will be randomly allocated to SELFIE in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) as the experimental condition or the control condition of TAU only, which will include access to all standard health care. SELFIE is a digital guided self-help intervention administered through a smartphone-based app to allow for interactive, personalized, real-time and real-world transfer of intervention components in individuals daily lives, blended with three training sessions delivered by trained mental health professionals over a 6-week period. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up by blinded assessors. The primary outcome will be the level of self-esteem as measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). DISCUSSION: The current study is the first to establish the efficacy of an EMI focusing on improving self-esteem transdiagnostically in youth exposed to childhood adversity. If this trial provides evidence on the efficacy of SELFIE, it has significant potential to contribute to minimizing the deleterious impact of childhood adversity and, thereby, preventing the development of mental disorder later in life.

This has led to shortage of donor corneas worldwide. Glycerol preservation of tissue remains a viable option in this scenario. The objective is to compare fresh corneal tissue (FCT) with glycerol-preserved cornea (GPC) in emergency corneal transplantation. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care centre of Uttarakhand. Medical records of the patients who underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK) were reviewed. FCT group included patients who underwent TPK with fresh corneal tissue and GPC group included patients who underwent TPK with glycerol preserved cornea. The indications and outcomes of TPK in the terms of therapeutic success were analysed and compared between both the groups. Results: A total of 94 eyes of 91 patients underwent TPK from October 2011 to August 2017. FCT group included 60 eyes of 57 patients and GPC group included 34 eyes of 34 patients. The primary indication of TPK was infectious keratitis in both the groups (FCT-81.6%; GPC - 91.2%) There was no significant difference in the therapeutic success in both the groups (P = 0.741, Odds ratio- 1.59 with 95% CI- 0.39-6.44).

We applied this testing algorithm to 4,360 samples from ED patients obtained in the spring of 2020 and 2021. Using multinomial logistic regression, we determined factors associated with infection and vaccination. For the algorithm, sensitivity and specificity for identifying vaccinated individuals were 100% and 99%, respectively, and 84% and 100% for previously infected individuals. Among the ED subjects, seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 increased from 2% to 24% between April 2020 and March 2021. Vaccination prevalence rose to 11% by mid-March 2021. Marked differences in burden of disease and vaccination coverage were seen by sex, race, and ethnicity. Hispanic patients, though accounting for 7% of the study population, had the highest relative burden of disease (17% of total infections) but with similar vaccination rates. Women and white individuals were more likely to be vaccinated than men or Black individuals.

For this reason, cardiotoxicity testing has become essential in drug development and a required step in the approval of any medication for use in humans. Blockade of the hERG K(+) channel and the consequent prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG have been considered the gold standard to predict the arrhythmogenic risk of drugs. In recent years, however, preclinical safety pharmacology has begun to adopt a more integrative approach that incorporates mathematical modeling and considers the effects of drugs on multiple ion channels. Despite these advances, early stage drug screening research only evaluates QT prolongation in experimental and computational models that represent healthy individuals. We suggest here that integrating disease modeling with cardiotoxicity testing can improve drug risk stratification by predicting how disease processes and additional comorbidities may influence the risks posed by specific drugs. In particular, chronic systemic inflammation, a condition associated with many diseases, affects heart function and can exacerbate medications cardiotoxic effects. We discuss emerging research implicating the role of inflammation in cardiac electrophysiology, and we offer a perspective on how in silico modeling of inflammation may lead to improved evaluation of

The objective of this trial was to compare active device treatment against a sham procedure (control). METHODS In a prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), patients were assigned to bilateral temperature-controlled RF treatment of the nasal valve (n = 77) or a sham procedure (n = 41), in which no RF energy was transferred to the device/treatment area. The device was applied to the mucosa over the lower lateral cartilage on the lateral nasal wall. The primary endpoint was responder rate at 3 months, defined as a 20% reduction in Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE)-scale score or 1 reduction in clinical severity category. RESULTS At baseline, patients had a mean NOSE-scale score of 76.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.8 to 79.5) and 78.8 (95% CI, 74.2 to 83.3) (p = 0.424) in the active treatment and sham-control arms, respectively. At 3 months, the responder rate was significantly higher in the active treatment arm (88.3% [95% CI, 79.2%-93.7%] vs 42.5% [95% CI, 28.5%-57.8%]; p < 0.001).

In the setting of murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) infection, a member of the Coronaviridae, activated endothelial cells and macrophages express distinct cell-surface procoagulants, including a novel prothrombinase, Fgl2/fibroleukin, which are important for both the initiation and localization of fibrin deposition.

AIM: this study aims to systematically review the published literature on SARS-CoV-2 in the asymptomatic patients to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among asymptomatic cases, as well as describe its epidemiological and clinical significance. METHOD: the literature was searched through four scientific databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct. RESULTS: a total of 63 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria where the majority of the reported studies were from China. However, there was a lack of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological studies from several countries worldwide, tracing the actual incidence of COVID-19, especially in asymptomatic patients. Studies with a large sample size (n>1000) estimated that percentage of people contracting SARS-CoV-2 and are likely to be asymptomatic ranges from 1.2-12.9%. However, the other studies with a smaller sample size reported a much higher incidence and indicated that up to 87.9% of COVID-19 infected individuals could be asymptomatic. Most of these studies indicated that asymptopatics are a potential source of infection to the community.

Results: The mean age of participants was 36.51  9.164 years and the majority (75.2%) of these were graduate dentists only. More than 80% of participants reported anxiety of catching COVID-19. The recorded anxiety level was higher amongst younger dentists and females. Awareness and practice levels among these dentists of precautions and infection-control measures associated with COVID-19 (94%) was found to be high and to be statistically significantly affected by age, qualification and designation (except GP vs. Specialist). With respect to the economic impact, about 75% of practitioners, regardless of demographical variables, reported that their income had declined by about 50%. Conclusions: The investigation provides clear insights into the anxiety, practice modifications and economic impact on dentists working in Iraq. Although there is a high level of knowledge and awareness of required practice regarding the COVID-19 outbreak among Iraqi dentists, they also reported a high level of anxiety.","output":"Anxiety, Practice Modification, and Economic Impact Among Iraqi Dentists During the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presence of a schema for XML documents has numerous advantages. Unfortunately, many XML documents in practice are not accompanied by a schema or a valid schema. Therefore, it is essential to devise algorithms to infer schemas. The fundamental task in XML schema inference is to learn regular expressions. In this paper, we focus on learning the subclass of RE(&) called SIREs (the subclass of regular expressions with interleaving). Previous work in this direction lacks inference algorithms that support inference from positive and negative examples. We provide an algorithm to learn SIREs from positive and negative examples based on genetic algorithms and parallel techniques. Our algorithm also has better expansibility, which means that our algorithm not only supports learning with positive and negative examples, but also supports learning with positive or negative examples only. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","output":"Inferring Restricted Regular Expressions with Interleaving from Positive and Negative Samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Populations with addiction are considered at-risk for both medical and financial effects of the COVID19 outbreak. Patients receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) were screened to assess need, vulnerability factors and potential clinical impact of the pandemic for referral and allocation of resources. Methods: A 31-item quality improvement survey of COVID19-related factors (e.g. engagement in social distancing, food and financial security) and clinical benchmarks of anxiety, craving, and treatment response was administered between March 24 and April 29, 2020. Anonymized data were compiled for study. Frequencies and means were evaluated for gender, age and financial effects on anxiety and craving ratings. Results: A total of 200 (N = 117 male; N = 80 female; N = 1 transgender) patients (age 42  13 years) were screened. Medical risk factors known to predict severe COVID19 reactions reported in 33% of patients did not contribute significantly to distress. While 95% of patients reported stable food and housing, personal financial and employment instability reported in 40% of patients was associated with significantly increased anxiety and craving rating, particularly for women.

Here we summarize the virology, disease burden, prevalence, distribution of genotypes and seasonality of RVs, and the current status of RV vaccination in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) from 2008 to 2018. METHODS: Rotavirus infection in Children in Southeast Asia countries was assessed using data from Pubmed and Google Scholars. Most countries in Southeast Asia have not yet introduced national RV vaccination programs. We exclude Brunei Darussalam, and Timor Leste because there were no eligible studies identified during that time. RESULTS: According to the 2008C2018 RV surveillance data for Southeast Asia, 40.78% of all diarrheal disease in children were caused by RV infection, which is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years old in Southeast Asia. Mortality was inversely related to socioeconomic status. The most predominant genotype distribution of RV changed from G1P[8] and G2P[4] into the rare and unusual genotypes G3P[8], G8P[8], and G9P[8]. Although the predominat strain has changed, but the seasonality of RV infection remains unchanged. One of the best strategies for decreasing the global burden of the disease is the development and implementation of effective vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: The most predominant genotype distribution of RV was changed time by time. Rotavirus vaccine is highly cost effective in Southeast Asian countries because the ratio between cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is less than one. These data are important for healthcare practitioners and officials to make appropriate policies and recommendations about RV vaccination.","output":"Rotavirus infection in children in Southeast Asia 2008C2018: disease burden, genotype distribution, seasonality, and vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the role played by individual characteristics and specific treatment methods in the evolution of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), through the lens of an observational study performed in a comparative approach between the first and second waves of coronavirus pandemic in Romania The research endeavor is configured on a two-fold approach, including a detailed observation of the evolution of 274 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (145 in the first wave and 129 in the second wave of infection) according to specific treatment methods applied and patients individual features, as well as an econometric (quantitative) analysis through structural equation modeling and Gaussian graphical models designed to acknowledge the correlations and causal relationship between all considered coordinates The main results highlight that the specific treatment methods applied had a positive influence on the evolution of COVID-19 patients, particularly in the second wave of coronavirus pandemic In case of the first wave of COVID-19 infection, GGM results entail that there is a strong positive correlation between the evolution of the patients and the COVID-19 disease form, which is further positively correlated with the treatment scheme The evolution of the patients is strongly and inversely correlated with the symptomatology and the ICU hospitalization Moreover, the disease form is strongly and inversely correlated with oxygen saturation and the residence of patients (urban/rural) The symptomatology at first appearance also strongly depends on the age of the patients (positive correlation) and of the fact that the patient is a smoker or non-smoker and has other comorbidities Age and gender are also important credentials that shape the disease degree and patient evolution in responding to treatment as well, our study attesting strong interconnections between these coordinates, the form of disease, symptomatology and overall evolution of the patients","output":"Individual Characteristics as Prognostic Factors of the Evolution of Hospitalized COVID-19 Romanian Patients: A Comparative Observational Study between the First and Second Waves Based on Gaussian Graphical Models and Structural Equation Modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policy decisions regarding immunization during a pandemic are informed by the ethical understandings of policy makers.

We now show that the very early innate response also has an immunosuppressive component. Infected cells upregulate the CD47 dont eat me signal, which slows the phagocytic uptake of dying and viable cells as well as downstream antigen-presenting cell (APC) functions. A CD47 mimic that acts as an essential virulence factor is encoded by all poxviruses, but CD47 expression on infected cells was found to be upregulated even by pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that encode no mimic. CD47 upregulation was revealed to be a host response induced by the stimulation of both endosomal and cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines, including those found in the plasma of hepatitis C patients, upregulated CD47 on uninfected dendritic cells, thereby linking innate modulation with downstream adaptive immune responses. Indeed, results from antibody-mediated CD47 blockade experiments as well as CD47 knockout mice revealed an immunosuppressive role for CD47 during infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Since CD47 blockade operates at the level of pattern recognition receptors rather than at a pathogen or antigen-specific level, these findings identify CD47 as a novel potential immunotherapeutic target for the enhancement of immune responses to a broad range of infectious agents.","output":"Upregulation of CD47 Is a Host Checkpoint Response to Pathogen Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because Australias universities have multiple missions, they also have a broad scope of operations.

The majority of studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and were qualitative. Evidence indicated that male involvement was significant, shaping the ability for a woman or girl to disclose her pregnancy or abortion decision. Men as partners were particularly influential, controlling resources necessary for abortion access and providing or withdrawing support for abortions. Denial or rejection of paternity was a critical juncture in many womens abortion trajectories. Mens involvement in abortion trajectories can be both direct and indirect. Contextual realities can make involving men in abortions a necessity, rather than a choice. The impact of male (lack of) involvement undermines the autonomy of a woman or girl to seek an abortion and shapes the conditions under which abortion-seekers are able to access care.

However, discharges are often delayed for non-medical reasons including access to social care. One aim of local health and social care partnerships to improve urgent and emergency care in England (known as urgent and emergency care (UEC) vanguards) was to improve integration of health and social care, which could lead to fewer delays. Consequently, we aimed to assess the impact of UEC vanguards on delayed discharges from hospital (delayed transfers of care (DTOC)) in England. DESIGN: Using a synthetic control estimation method 29 local authorities (LAs) that were UEC vanguards partners were averaged into a single treated unit and compared with a unit created using data from LAs that were not UEC vanguards partners to estimate the impact of UEC vanguards on DTOC. Sensitivity analysis included fixed effects panel regressions and various placebo tests. SETTING: 150 LAs in England (excluding city of London and Isles of Scilly); 29 LAs were partners in UEC vanguards between August 2015 and March 2018. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Quarterly data on days of DTOC at LA level for the period 2010C2017. RESULTS: Synthetic control estimation showed a large difference in DTOC days between UEC vanguards partner LAs compared with those that were not, with on average 23.7% lower DTOC per quarter (491 DTOC days per quarter). Fixed effect panel regressions found DTOC rates lower by 43.1% (99% CI 13.8% to 72.4%) in UEC partner LAs after the start of the vanguards programme.

SUMMARY: A retrospective chart review of 8 adults on warfarin admitted to Michigan Medicine with COVID-19 infection was conducted and reported as a case series. Outcomes of interest were difference in average daily dose of warfarin prior to admission (PTA) and while inpatient (IP), warfarin sensitivity, time in therapeutic range (TTR), confirmed or suspected thromboembolic event, any major or clinically significant bleeding episodes, and in-hospital mortality. IP average daily warfarin doses were lower when compared to PTA average daily doses [1.3 mg (1.3) vs. 6.2 mg (4.1)]. The mean percentage decrease in dose was 68.8% (23) and the mean absolute dose difference was 4.8 mg (4.3). Mean IP percentage tests in range was 30.8% (24.6) and mean IP warfarin sensitivity was 4.2 (3.8), both of which differed from PTA TTR and warfarin sensitivity for those with data available (n = 3, n = 6, respectively). One patient was treated for suspected acute pulmonary embolism while on warfarin and one patient experienced clinically relevant bleeding. In-hospital mortality was zero, mean length of stay (LOS) was 17 days (14.4), and mean intensive care unit (ICU) LOS for the 3 patients requiring ICU level care was 14.3 days (4.5).
